The Factory - Cafe With a Soul ," 11/25/2016 1 check-in Love love loved the atmosphere! Every corner of the coffee shop had its own style, and there were swings!!! I ordered the matcha latte, and it was muy fantastico! Ordering and getting my drink were pretty streamlined. I ordered on an iPad, which included all beverage selections that ranged from coffee to wine, desired level of sweetness, and a checkout system. I got my latte within minutes!  I was hoping for a typical heart or feather on my latte, but found myself listing out all the possibilities of what the art may be. Any ideas? ", pos

The Factory - Cafe With a Soul ," 11/30/2016 1 check-in Listed in Brunch Spots I loved the eclectic and homey plush decor and who doesn't want to swing and drink their coffee?  I would categorize this as a pricier coffee place but, to me it was worth it.  After Thanksgiving nobody wants to make brunch so we headed out in search of chicken and waffles.  There is ample parking in the private lot and  ordering is done through I-Pads.  Pick a seat and they will call your name when your items are ready.  Be patient because some of the coffee drinks take longer than others.  I had the cold brew coffee, chicken and waffles and we shared a pop+art!  The po+art was strawberry; light and fluffy on the outside and gooey sweet filling on the inside.  The chicken and waffles wasn't the standard so expect different, complex and interesting flavors from the accompanying slaw and sauce.  I thoroughly enjoyed it but, the waffle was a bit bland and maybe could have used a bit of honey to spruce it up.  The coffee here is spot on and I hear that their hot chocolate is the bomb but, I will have to wait for the weather to cool off to try that.  A great place to be cozy and chat with your friends, a date or read a book. Chicken and waffles Pop tart Coffee See all photos from Carmela S. for The Factory - Cafe With a Soul ", pos

I loved their computerized user friendly ordering system, it made it easy me to pick & choose all the items I wanted to try. I ordered pop tart, chicken & waffles, strawberry waffles (photos uploaded). This place is ideal for ordering a few dishes to share with your group. Seating is limited since this place is fairly new with lots of visitors. Arrive early and be prepared to wait a bit if you with a large grop.

The Factory - Cafe With a Soul ," 11/20/2016 1 check-in Very cute cafe! I think from the moment I stepped in, there really wasn't anything I didn't find cute at The Factory. From their decor to their cups, everything was really cute. It's really the perfect place for a catching up with friends or a coffee date.  When you go order, there's really the least amount of interaction ever with the workers. You just pick your order on an iPad and they'll call your order out after for you to pick up at the counter. The whole thing's pretty novel honestly. I got the Viva Matcha Latte and it was so good! Perfect amount of sweetness and perfect temperature. I went on a cold night and this cafe is just so cozy, it was such a great combination. They have these swings as well which were pretty fun to sit on honestly.  Prices are what I would expect for a cafe like this, not super cheap, but not too pricey. There's no wifi here, so if you want to study, maybe this isn't the right place. But overall, very nice atmosphere! Viva matcha latte and Cortado ", pos 
The Factory - Cafe With a Soul ," 10/27/2016 2 check-ins Listed in ""Nuptial Coffee Bliss!"", Anderson Lane is the new Black Oh hey, the pro vs con format. I've never used that before. Let's try it:  Pros: 1. This place is cooler than I thought. 2. It's open until 2am. No, really. 3. They have beer & wine. I didn't know that until I saw the beer taps. They offered me a sample.  Cons: 1. If you have to describe The Factory with one word, it probably won't be ""inexpensive.""  I don't think they're shooting for the ""Sixth Coffeehouse on Anderson Lane but with Flash"" title here, I think they really want to be the official bistro in the neighborhood - far more casual than Bartlett or Hopdoddy, but with a lot more flair than Tea Haus or Starbuck Evenings. Staying open until 2am is a good start, and let's see if they add more to the menu. Remember, no one thought that gentrified Walmart would do well either.  In the meantime, have fun with those chicken & waffles, and their colorful matcha-infused coffees. I'm only interested in straight black, and their pourover Stumptown is great stuff. Try the $5 pop tart at least once, mainly because you can. And then let's meet back here in a couple of weeks, just to see what's been tweaked. This place defines hipster man-cave. I liked the long table with 1/2 bar chairs & stools, & the cool plates & cups. There's a $5 pop tart. ", pos 
The Factory - Cafe With a Soul ," 11/2/2016 2 check-ins Love this place!  5 stars for cleanliness 5 stars for fun ambiance/ open space 5 stars for ample seating and comfort 5 stars for convenient parking 5 stars for attentive employees and fast service  I am definitely a fan Cafe w/ a Soul. I finally found a coffee shop I can study at without sacrificing comfort (Starbucks' uncomfortable chairs). The coffee shop endorses social connection, hence, wifi  isn't available. It makes me really happy that a lot of students hang out here with their book bags and laptops and we can all just study in peace and somehow quiet (the background music can get pretty loud). Unfortunately, there will always be that kid who's obnoxiously loud and would like the whole world to know her business. Seriously, unless it's something intriguing or educational, no one cares. In addition, as much ""fun"" as this place looks, it's not child friendly. So parents, make sure your children do not hit the table in front of it and knock out the chess set. Lastly, the sex images in the bathrooms are definitely not appropriate for children.  The ambiance is very much like Austin-- very eccentric and hip! Food and drink presentations are on par. Drink prices are reasonable and similar to good ole Starbucks. But unlike you're typical coffee shop, they have real food such as chicken and waffles.  My favorite about this place is the cleanliness. The employees do a good job maintaining the place. Also, as I watch them make coffees, they do it with fines as if they're creating some type of art, it's pretty cool (in my opinion).  In conclusion, Cafe w/ a Soul is probably the best coffee shop I've ever been to. It's like studying in my own home but away from distractions. I'm awake!

The Factory - Cafe With a Soul ," 10/25/2016 1 check-in Ok, let's try this approach...  Pros: Music Seating Decor General ambiance Service  Cons: iPad ordering (I'm a crotchety old man, kids) Limited coffee menu, or menu in general Relatively expensive Food is pretty but lackluster  I'm still sitting here as I type this and I'm less than overjoyed with the experience, sadly. The space and vibe are great but not quite familiar or intimate enough to beat out a place like Genuine Joe down the street. It seems like they bank on the vibe, and fall short the rest of the way. (This would be a great hangout for the artsy/design crowd having a collaborative meeting.)  The staff is great but the iPad ordering system limits your required interaction with them. They take pride in no wifi to increase interaction but then use iPads instead of people?  Seating is ample, if cramped in a surprisingly large space.  But the food, kids. So pretty, but again lackluster. I tried the Pop+art ($5) and the Nutella Waffle ($4.75) and they both sit on their respective tiny awkward plates half eaten. (Yes the plate liners are cute) The waffle is a great idea but the waffle itself  has no flavor and there's no delight. The tart is similar - the pastry crust is much too thick compared to the Smuckers jam tasting filling and it is essentially just pure sugar. The pastry itself doesn't even taste buttery or crisp. Meh. There appears to be no soul in this confectionary.  Coffee- passable. But at $4 for a cortado and a $1.50 up-charge for almond milk- I'll pick another place.  I get why the reviews are so good here, but there are much better places nearby for that ""cafe with a soul"" feel. This feels like an ACL pop-up. Going for that?  Great, come here.

The Factory - Cafe With a Soul , 11/10/2016 3 check-ins This place has been shown on my social media for days so i finally visited! One of THE cutest and artistic looking coffeeshops I have ever visited. You can self order which is nice because you can take your time and look at the pictures to help you decide! I especially liked how pictures were shown so I knew which coffee/tea came out aesthetically  I ordered the famous matcha green latte and i dont usually drink coffee but it went beyond my expectations. They give you a good amount and its creamy and sweet. Only downside is no wifi.. So hard to study here.

The Factory - Cafe With a Soul ," 11/20/2016 The store has A+ decoration, but honestly, the coffee it made is not as good as other coffee shop in the surrounding area. It has no wifi, so good for hang out with friend or read a book. Not sure why there is no restroom here. Ordering app is well made, but probably won't be my coffee stop because of the quality of food/coffee. It's selling you the atmosphere they created, so don't expected the food/coffee. Probably would be a good date spot. 8 dollar tiny chicken and waffle. One of the most expensive chicken and waffle. ", neutral 
The Factory - Cafe With a Soul ," 11/17/2016 1 check-in Listed in 2016 - The Third Time is a Charm! The Factory has A+ decor and a very innovative interactionless (tablet) ordering system. This allows you to look up what to get without feeling pressured by a barista staring at you waiting for you to order. The eclectic selection of tables, couches, and swings (?!) inside with a small kiddy corner appeal to many different types of tastes. This is seriously a cool place to hang out.  However, when it comes to the coffee and food, it's rather not cheap. The waffles range from $4-$8, and coffee is between $3.50 and $5. The quality of the coffee is not yet up to par with other coffee mainstays in Austin, so I would probably not choose to come here just for coffee. However, it is a CUTE date place and I know that M and I will probably come back to chat, people-watch, or read books. ", neutral

The Factory - Cafe With a Soul ," 11/9/2016 1 check-in Listed in In Search of Fantastic Coffee So, I really didn't want to write this review. I didn't want to tell anyone how awesome The Factory - Cafe With a Soul is because I don't want it overrun and super busy with no place to sit like so many other decent coffee shops in Austin. I happened to come in here with a friend mid-week and we sat here for several hours, enjoying the peace and quiet, the atmosphere, and the awesome coffee.  This place is a little eclectic - lots of peculiar art, books, games, knick-knacks, and an almost head-scratching drink and food menu. Waffles and pop tarts...and beer? And... coffee mojitos? Well, it works. Whatever is going on here, it works fabulously. They serve Stumptown Coffee, which as someone from the Northwest, I totally appreciate. They also brew coffee correctly. There is not a hint of bitterness or overcooked milk going on here. The iPad ordering screens are mostly cool, (although they need more options for customization) and the million different types of seating, (couches, pillows, swings, big chairs, little chairs, bar seating, regular tables) is both delightful and refreshing. The baristas make foam art - something that I have only seen at Houndstooth here in Austin. Hanging out here was a wonderful experience - this is a five star establishment, the best coffee house I've been to in Austin, and I will be back - time and time again.

It's always great to see places doing something new and unique. The seating arrangements and atmosphere are definitely fun.

The Factory - Cafe With a Soul ," 10/15/2016 1 check-in Note: Do not come here if you're looking for a place to work remotely! There is no WiFi and no outlets. Staff says they are hoping to create an environment where people socialize and enjoy each other's company rather than being on their phones.  For a spot to catch up with friends over coffee and pastries, I highly recommend coming here! There is ample seating, an open layout, and a lot to look at  and talk about including wooden swings, books and a chess board on a table, and a cute corner of pillows in another corner.  They serve coffee drinks, waffles, and pastries. The pop tart was extremely sweet, so much so that I was unable to finish even half. Their cortado was pretty good. The food and drinks are quite pricey here, which makes me question returning.  Presentation and ambience wise, I give this place 5 stars! But price and food, probably a 3. ", pos

The Factory - Cafe With a Soul ," 10/12/2016 1 check-in Checked out The Factory this past Sunday with my husband. We wanted to try their delicious looking waffles and were definitely not disappointed.  Husband ordered an iced coffee drink that was delicious, but it wasn't as good as my Golden Age of Milk Tea, well worth the 10 minute wait for the tea to steep.  We both ordered the Nutella Waffle and it was perfect. From the wood plate with the AMAZING paper liner printed with a famous person and an inspirational quote from them. I wanted just the paper because it was so cute and well done. The waffle is basically half a waffle, spread with Nutella and a layer of bananas, then folded in half. While small, it was a perfect amount, the bananas balancing out the sweetness of the Nutella. The waffle itself was crisp perfection, providing a crunch to the meal. The menu is very limited: there was the nutella waffle and a fried chicken waffle. I'm hoping they'll eventually serve other waffles, but totally respect their decision to start small.  The space is gorgeous. From the swings to the mural above the bar, everything looks meticulously planned out. And here is where my biggest advice comes: this place is really not for kids. The way the seating is set up is really for larger people and there is definitely no place for high chairs. While there is giant magnetic poetry on one of the columns, a crazy chair outside and a couple of table games, the giant chess set looks risky for grabby kids. If you have a well-behaved child who can handle it, I would think its fine. However, I watched several families come in and either leave or order to go, commenting it wasn't the best space for them. While this doesn't bother me (I love kidless spaces), it might be jarring to someone expecting to have brunch with the family.  I am so excited to become a regular here! Great new spot! ", pos 
The Factory - Cafe With a Soul ," 10/10/2016 This place is so cute. New favorite coffee spot on Burnet/in Northcross. Almost wish I was still in grad school,  so I would have an excuse to be there everyday.  Amazing coffee and best chicken & waffles ever! The chicken was seasoned perfectly and made for a delicious savory brunch (with the house made slaw they give you on the side). The olive oil cake was also awesome, light and sweet. Perfect coffee companion. My husband and I will definitely be back, as we loved everything and felt it was all very reasonable priced. Olive oil cake, chicken & waffle and 15-minutes-of-fame coffee!

The Factory - Cafe With a Soul ," 10/25/2016 Tried this new cafe spot on Burnet with a friend - unassuming storefront, the decor is quaint af and you have to order from iPads at the counter and then choose a place to sit.

The cold brew coffee was fantastic and my friend's milk tea turned out great too.  Good spot for conversations. Only knocking down a star for the limited options.

The Factory - Cafe With a Soul ," 11/23/2016 1 check-in My best friend and I came to The Factory after seeing it on a couple of best new Austin brunch lists. It's super cute and trendy, to the point where it feels kind of out of place in a strip mall. Although I loved the interior design and general ambiance of the place, I was a little disappointed with the menu. This is more of a coffee shop than a cafe - their food options are pretty limited. My friend ordered the chicken and waffles and I ordered Nutella waffles with strawberries and bananas. For the price I paid, the portions were definitely on the smaller side. I enjoyed my meal still, but it's hard to mess up Nutella and fruit, so I wasn't particularly impressed.

The Factory - Cafe With a Soul ," 10/7/2016 1 check-in Came in on the first day of opening, hours currently 6am-2pm. At some point they'll stay open till 12 midnight. I think this might be the most beautiful cafe in Austin, the interior is charming, snazzy, cozy. There's even a pair of swings to sit on while you enjoy your coffee and play a game of chess. I ordered the Marymint Monroe, basically a mint mojito. It's been a while since I've been to Philz coffee so it's hard to compare, but I think the Marymint is a little creamier. Also had the banana nutella waffle, bananas and nutella are always a winning combination, can't go wrong there. No wifi yet but I'm sure it will come soon.

The Marvelous Vintage Tea Party Co. ," 11/19/2012 Sophie at Marvelous Vintage Tea Party Company was absolutely amazing to work with. She puts in a huge amount of time and effort into planning exactly what you want at a budget you are comfortable with. What I especially liked about this was the fact that she's willing to let customers handle certain aspects of the event if they'd like to make their budget smaller. For example, she suggested we purchase our own flowers at wholesale. She also has connections with a liquor merchant in Austin that allows you 15% off your alcohol purchases for the event--a fantastic deal! In terms of venue, a MVTPC celebration can be hosted anywhere in the Austin areas--Sophie was more than willing to drive to Round Rock to make our celebration happen.

Vintage Heart Coffee ," 11/17/2016 Listed in Master List of Vivian's Eats Ehhh. Wasn't my cup of tea.  I swung by this tiny coffeeshop on a cold February evening with my significant other. We were meeting someone for an career-focused informational interview. I have to give kudos for Vintage Heart for the awesome decor - the inside actually made me feel like I was in a pioneer-era general store. Cozy, quaint, rustic. Lots of tables, we had no trouble finding a seat for three. Several individuals were sitting around on their laptops, so I assume there was also decent wifi.  I ordered a vanilla latte. The portions are huge. That was good. I couldn't really taste the vanilla. That was bad.  I'm not a huge coffee drinker, but I do enjoy my lattes. This one was a disappointment. I could barely even taste the *milk* - it was overwhelmingly coffee and water. Maybe it was just one bad experience (boyfriend enjoyed his espresso, for what that's worth), but sometimes one shot is all a restaurant gets before I look elsewhere. ", neutral 
Vintage Heart Coffee ," 9/24/2016 2 check-ins I've tried the hot tea, peach oolong iced tea, and spinach croissant * Hot tea: Ordered the fruity black tea on a teapot. Keeps me awake and pretty tasty. Can ask for more hot water for free. * Peach Oolong: refreshing with a hint of sweetness. Served in a mason jar. * Spinach Croissant: they can warm it up. The croissant was a good size and can be a filling meal. Bread is nice and crisp, wish there's more of the cheese and spinach fillings though.  Atmosphere * Very homey. The space seems a bit small but its never too crowded. You may want to sit near the entrance if you prefer natural lightings. * There's a tall seating area with hanging lights up front, while the other half of the space is filled with small wooden tables and chairs. They also have a sofa all the way at the back. * There's some small tables and chairs outside for extra outdoor seatings. Almost no one ever sit outside though (perhaps because they will be looking directly at a cemetery across the street? Not sure) * Temperature is perfect!!!!! No need to bring extra layers. * I cant seem to get connected to the wi-fi when I sit closer to the front area of the store, but if you sit closer to the back then the wi-fi is great. There's also plenty of electric outlets everywhere. * The place is generallt pretty quiet, a mix of people chatting and people studying or doing work. There's always a handful of UT students, but most of the crowds seems to be non-students.  * Location: Right across a cemetery. It is also next to kebabalicious. There's a small parking lot at front and back side of the store, as well as street parking around the area.  * Service: This place probably have one of the friendliest staffs in Austin. Food and drinks are also prepared quickly. ", pos

The vibe is chill and relaxed and the decor is a lovely mix of industrial and shabby chic.  I normally get lattes here and they are hot, not too sweet and delicious. The americanos are also well done with no bitterness. Very consistent quality! My favorite food nom noms used to be the doughnuts (coffee and lavender are kick ass), the blueberry scone (100% the shit) and the ham/mozz and turkey/provolone croissant which (I swear to God) weigh at least one pound each, but I think their vendor went out of business....? The croissants are heated for you and they give you SO MUCH bang for your buck. Feels like a chipotle burrito without the diarrhea. Not sure what food they offer there now since I've moved from ATX, but I feel 100% confident that they only select the best of vendors.

Vintage Heart Coffee ," 7/4/2016 1 check-in Listed in ATX Coffee Fix Bucolic and quaint come to mind when visiting Vintage Heart. I like how there is plenty of natural light near the front.  Parking can be a hassle even during weekday work hours when most people would be working. There are some parking spots near the back but if you do snag a spot, be forewarned that it may be hard to get out if some customers end up choosing to park near the fence, taking up more space that you could use to back out.  When I made an order for a macchiato, I was glad I caught that I was ""upcharged"" before I slid my card. I am sure it was an honest mistake but it was just something I noticed. The store owner(?) quickly corrected it in the end.  Overall, the distance from where I live as well as the parking lot situation are big enough deterrents to prevent me from visiting anytime soon. Especially with the number of high-quality coffeeshops in ATX. ", neutral

Vintage Heart Coffee ," 7/19/2016 1 check-in Quaint coffee house, kind of feels like your friend's living room. It's dimly lit and isn't air conditioned as well as other cafes in the area so it was only semi comfortable for me to get some work done.  The coffee is good, downside is they only had a few baked goods when I went so if you're hungry you should check out the food trucks in the nearby area before/after your coffee!

Vintage Heart Coffee ," 4/18/2016 1 check-in Alright here's the low down, I'm a sucker for drinks in a mason jar.  As soon as I see Yelp pictures of this, I'm there.  I'm not sure why, I've pondered it for quite some time, maybe I need to ask a therapist.  Anyhow, that's what led me here on a Sunday afternoon.  If you are entering from 7th street the parking can be pretty tight.  I think there are only about 2 spaces on the 7th street side of the store.  There is a back alley behind the store where there are a few more spots back there.  There is also a rear entrance to the store you can go through if you park in the back.  Once inside it has the feel of being in a small house which is pretty cool.  There is a good amount of seating divided into 2 rooms with a huge bar area with stools on both sides.  Great area for working with laptops. Now on to the drinks.  We got a cold brew and a iced chai latte.  I had to get cold drinks because again, I'm here for the mason jars.  The iced chai was very refreshing.  It tasted as a chai latte should with just the right amount of spice. The cold brew was bold and had good flavor.  No lingering after taste and just what I needed to energize me for the rest of the day. There are so many awesome coffee shops opening up all around town.  I would definitely add this one to my list of ones to try if you haven't been here.

Vintage Heart Coffee ," 5/3/2016 I was looking for a not too busy, not too loud coffee shop recently that would be convenient to two of us coming from downtown and one coming from Northeast Austin. Harder to find than you would think... A friend mentioned she thought Vintage Heart was not too loud and I might like it.  Done!  Made that appointment and showed up early to scope the place out. There were a few people scattered here and there at 1pm midweek, but it really made me happy that the music was not obtrusive and I could find a place to park.  The counter staff were very pleasant and helpful, and I put in my order for a Cinnamon Latte after perusing all of the options. (Um, did I mention they have baked goods from Russell's Bakery? - Thankfully not the carrot or Italian cream cake, because those are my diet kryptonite!)  My latte came out and was really beautifully done. I have to admit my first thought was,""I bet this is going to have that fruity after taste I often notice in high end lattes.""  Nope. It was exquisite. Dark but not burnt, no fruity tones and no bitter aftertaste. Amazing coffee flavor!  I thought it might be just mine, but my friends who ordered two other flavors of lattes had the same experience. They both said, ""This is the best latte I have had in Austin.""  Nice job, Vintage Heart! I will be back and will bring more friends.  Note: I would have happily shared this review on Facebook, but for some reason it kept picking up your sign in the women's bathroom as the image, and that is NOT something I want to post.

Bae remarked that this was ""hands down the best vanilla latte I've had."" I had a Violet Femme iced tea (lavender earl grey) that was super.  The reason it gets five stars: our barista was super friendly and accommodating. She asked us - yes asked us - if we needed the wifi password. And I nearly passed out with cuteness overload when she gave it to us (that's a secret that you'll have to stop by to experience). She also gave us a ton of places to check out for brunch and hanging; they were spot on and totally our pace and level of weirdness.  All in all, this place was cool and delicious without being pretentious. ", pos 
Vintage Heart Coffee , 10/9/2016 The coffee shop itself is cute and clean.  The lavender latte is definitely worth trying at least once.  It's lightly sweet and distinctly floral.

My favorite drink is the iced vanilla latte with lavender. I would never think to put lavender in my drink but it's SO delightful. I highly recommend! It's a good spot to chill and relax. Also, the staff is super friendly and nice. Keep it up, baristas! :) ", pos 
Vintage Heart Coffee ," 9/17/2016 I work at the food truck next door and Vintage Heart's coffee and cold brew is the fuel that keeps me running. Dark, strong, fresh coffee! Only suggestion is to upgrade AC system as it does get stuffy inside when its a full house. ", pos 
Vintage Heart Coffee ," 4/17/2016 3 check-ins I am a picky person when it comes to coffee. I rarely drink it due to my heightened sense of taste and smell. The burnt beans and acidic flavor can sometimes be overwhelming at certain places. Vintage Heart Coffee is one of the very few places where I love to go and actually get myself a cup of coffee. Their lavender latte is UH-MAY-ZING. I really liked it with the almond milk, too. It has this subtle scent of lavender and toasted marshmallow. The ambience is so cute and cozy, yet very artsy and trendy! Their service is really great and the location is great if you are in central Austin. If I had the money and lived closer, I would come here every day! The building is covered in art on the outside, too. There is not much parking available but many people walk or ride their bicycles here so I have never had trouble actually finding parking. I bring my sister here every time she is in town from Dallas along with all of my close friends who are coffee lovers. I wish they would open a location up north but until then I will make my drive down to this location every time I crave the lavender latte. I'm thankful that such a delightful drink exists in Austin!! hehe ", pos 
Vintage Heart Coffee ," 7/19/2016 We went to many places in Austin within 2 days and Vintage Heart is absolutely my favorite local coffee shop. I love the location, the decor and of course, the drinks. It was so cozy and very friendly, a suitable place to sit and talk for hours with  whoever you're with or just meet that day. I ordered the Lavender latte and although I loved it, I had to say the Vanilla latte my friend had was so much better. The outside was pretty spacey at well;  if the weather allowed I would have totally hung out at the porch. The colored wall is a nice touch, we took a few pictures using it as a background.

Vintage Heart Coffee ," 2/25/2015 26 check-ins Listed in Austin Espresso Essentials The Location: Looks like your average Austin hipster coffee joint- next to a couple food trucks, graffiti art, small lot in the back for parking. Might seem like an awkward spot to find at first. As for the inside, I love the atmosphere - chic, modern and comfortable with plenty of seating and sophisticated decor.  The Drinks: So far, I have tried the vanilla latte, cortado, and lavender latte. Everything I've had is honestly very good; I haven't tried anything here that I didn't like. Mocha soy latte was good but vanilla was better, and iced soy latte was really light and refreshing. Their hot lattes are light, smooth, and not too sweet. I highly recommend the lavender latte. Once you get it, nothing else will compare, anywhere.  The Service: Generally slow; when I go, there is usually one person working for a long line, but they are very friendly and efficient and definitely know what they're doing. Worth any wait!  Overall: Definitely my new favorite coffee shop in Austin. Great atmosphere, great coffee. ", pos 
Vintage Heart Coffee ," 2/25/2015 2 check-ins Listed in comfy, cozy, & chill This is one of my favorite, favorite study spots in Austin. I'm super particular about study environments, and very few would garner a 4-5 star rating from me.  Vintage Heart is warm and comfortable, with bright, natural lighting and fairy lights. It's not open very late (and probably not too brightly-lit in the evenings anyway), so it's definitely a perfect place to go for those early morning and afternoon study grinds or catch-ups. Although the venue itself is relatively small, Vintage Heart has living-room style couches, a bar, plenty of small and medium-sized tables, and a larger high table with lots of working space. Since it's slightly further from campus, it's also typically not TOO busy! Good, calm music, too, and the perfect amount of background noise. Wifi is also free and reliable!  The lavender latte tastes amazing and is super aromatic, and the vanilla mocha is chocolatey and delicious. The heart design on the foam is a nice touch.  One of my favorite things about Vintage Heart, too, is their attention to the environment and unnecessary waste - they use glass cups and mason jars for both their hot and cold drinks and use pieces of washable, patterned cloth as their napkins. Love it.  The downsides: parking is super difficult with such few lots - it could fit about seven cars in total. Also, during the peak times in the afternoon, snagging a comfortable study spot can sometimes be difficult and since there is normally only one employee making the drinks, there may be a little bit of wait. lavender latte ", pos 
Vintage Heart Coffee ," 8/22/2015 4 check-ins Vintage heart took my heart for three reasons 1. The place is stunning inside. Think modern with a vintage feel that is nice and bright. 2. Available parking: While there are only maybe 6 spots in total, it's still is something and I was able to find parking quickly during my visit. 3. The staff: they go beyond expectations and make great coffee 4.Simple menu, it's not at all a overwhelming amount of choices and they have a variety of pastries to choose from!  On a rainy summer day, where the walls were leaking and people were fast to work, I had to make the hard choice between Vintage Heart and the nearby Figure 8. I was happy with my choice as  the coffee was great, I love the fact they have homemade syrups and the brownie was killer. Regardless of the atmosphere, it's a bit too quiet and small for a gathering of friends but i will surely be back! ", pos 
Vintage Heart Coffee ," 2/19/2015 45 check-ins Hands down one of my favorite coffee shops in Austin. It's a small place, but I normally come in the mornings and it isn't that crowded. I love the ambience in this place. It's very conducive to studying and the baristas are so nice.  I would highly recommend the lavender latte or vanilla latte. You will NOT be disappointed! The cortado is also really good!  The only downside is that parking can be tricky here. There's a very small parking lot. I believe there are three spots in the front and a few more in the back. Just try to come when it's not busy and you should be fine. Vanilla latte. ", pos 
Vintage Heart Coffee ," 8/25/2015 6 check-ins Vintage Heart is one of my staple places to go. It's never packed but often has a lively energy with people chatting, working, or reading.  The baristas are kind and welcoming. They serve their coffee in cute glassware. And they are one of the only coffee shops in Austin that saves on wasting napkins by providing pretty cloth handkerchiefs for your use.  Live on the east side? Want some good coffee and a peaceful spot to meet a friend? Come and give Vintage Heart a sip. ", pos

Vintage Heart Coffee ," 1/27/2016 The first day I tried this place out I went up to order some tea, Barrista was not rude, but not really friendly (close to unfriendly actually). Plops a teabag in a cup of hot water and shoves it over. My eyes narrow to slits, because wtf ... (usually there'll be a pot of brewed tea for you or they'll actually take the time to let the tea sit before bringing it to you), but I kiss my teeth, leave a decent tip then go back to have my ""tea"" (had to actually go back to get milk separately ... which is another irritation)  I go back to order the same thing a few hours later (was at the shop all afternoon). And this time, post-tip, I get quicker service, a pot of brewed tea, a mug with brewed tea poured in, and a special milk container with freshly poured milk ... nary a teabag in sight.  Side. Eye.  So yeah ... I liked this place and will be going back but that whole chain of events kinda got on my nerves. Maybe its because ... you know ... I'm black, and she thought I wouldn't tip (it happens), or maybe she was just having a bad morning, either way ... poor form.  I'm sure they can do better though, it is a nice Austin coffeeshop and I'm very pro-Austin-coffeshop so go support this place, because its actually a pretty cute, well laid out, clean with fast wifi (sideye @ Patika ... grrr), parking can be a bit of an issue though.  Enjoy.  PS: Will amend to 4 stars when I've gone back a couple of times to make sure poor/erratic service isn't a recurring theme here.  PS2: went back ... service was great. I like.  PS3: The wifi here is amazing ... I hang out at coffeeshops all day ... trust me on this. ", pos 
Vintage Heart Coffee ," 1/10/2015 I wanted to go to Vintage Heart because they brew Third Coast coffee, which is my favorite in town. I was not at all disappointed.  Beautiful, modern farmhouse decor -- white walls mixed with wooden furniture. Between couches, tables, and bar stools, there are a variety of seating arrangements. There were only a few people at 10 am, which gave a nice quiet ambiance.  Barista was friendly and welcoming. The cortado she served me was amazing, and I enjoyed a donut from Red Rabbit Cooperative.  There are many places to get coffee on the East side, but this should really be your first choice.

Vintage Heart Coffee ," 12/10/2015 5 check-ins This place is so cute!  Given that this is finals season for UT students, I expected to have issues finding a seat or parking, but I really didn't, which was a nice surprise. Given, I did come Thursday around noon. But never once was the place packed during my time here--in fact, it was pretty empty, which was also a surprise given that it's a pretty small space. This was only my second visit here because normally when I try to come on the weekends, it seems to be super packed.  There's a lot of natural light, and the color scheme is easy on the eyes, and the decor is super cute! I also don't get the pretentious Austin hipster vibe. Another plus is that the aesthetic of Vintage Heart is insta-worthy! haha  The environment is very conducive to studying--a variety of seating arrangements from a bar area to couches to normal chairs and tables, the wifi is free and fast (and has an adorable password!), outlets are abundant (though awkwardly placed in some spots), the music is good and soft enough so it doesn't distract. It seems like there's a mixture of people who come--middle aged people getting some work done, yuppies perusing through a newspaper/magazine, college students studying, etc. Everyone seems to be very friendly and focused on their tasks. The whole environment is pretty chill but for some reason, everyone seems to be getting in the zone pretty easily. But then again, maybe I just came at a good time.  A cute sidenote: they don't have typical napkins. They have cute, printed cloths! It's the little details about this place that make me so happy.  In terms of the beverages, the first time I came, I got a hot vanilla latte, and this time I got an iced vanilla latte. I also tried my friend's iced americano, too. All of the beverages were pretty spot on. The lattes didn't have notes of a super dark, rich espresso, which I'm personally ok with. Slightly too sweet, but I prefer my coffee on the bitter side. Prices are on par with other places in Austin.  The baristas are also very friendly, patient and seem like normal humans.  Overall, this is one of my favorite coffee spots in Austin! I personally love the vibe and the beverages. The only cons are the small-ish parking lot and the slightly dirty bathroom, but the decor of it is cute for what they had to work with haha.  10/10 would come again. and again. and again. ", pos

Vintage Heart Coffee ," 3/20/2016 Was visiting Austin for SXSW and luckily discovered this place. I've never felt more welcome and comfortable away from home. The music isn't too loud and isn't the top 40 hit garbage often heard in coffee shops. (Alabama Shakes was playing during my last visit.) The customer service exceeded my expectations which is rare. These aren't the average millennial baristas who seem to hate themselves and their jobs. These baristas seem genuinely happy and devoted to making sure you get what you need. Places like this are bittersweet because it makes me painfully aware that there aren't any coffee shops as good as this one where I'm from.  Oh, and the wifi is fast, too! About 6 megs down if you're the only one using it. ", pos

Vintage Heart Coffee ," 5/24/2015 Hmm, I'm kind of split on 3 or 4 stars here. Why 3 stars: the coffee was just okay. I went with yelp recommendations and ordered the iced vanilla latte. Super cute in the mason jar, but honestly kinda just tasted like Starbucks? Not necessarily a bad thing, but considering they make the vanilla syrup in house here it's just kinda disappointing. Makes me feel like I shoulda gotten espresso. Will update this review if I return!  Why 4 stars: this spot is really cute, with warm lighting and lots of seating. It's a great place to get work done (they have outlets!) or just meet up with friends.  Cool street art outside also. ", pos

Vintage Heart Coffee ," 7/26/2015 1 check-in Vintage Heart is a tiny no frills coffee shop located in a converted home.  Their roasted beans are from local Austin Third Coast Coffee Traders.  They really don't have much except coffee, as they only had a couple of pastry items on the counter.  What was nice is that out of the few items offered they did have a couple of Russell's gluten free cookies, and a muffin.  My group of friends each chose something different: a latte, a chai tee latte, and an iced coffee.  The latte art on my friends drink was beautiful.  She mentioned that her coffee was as good as her favorite spot in Brooklyn, my friend liked her Chai, and I absolutely loved my iced coffee served in a cute mason jar.  Their was only one barista working behind the counter, and she was very friendly.  The space is small and it was jam packed with warm bodies all hanging out with their laptops taking advantage of the wifi and multitude of available outlets to plug in at.  They have some tiny fans blowing limited air around, but the place definitely on this 95+ day got stuffy and warm.  We were all melting.  So while the coffee is delightful, this is not a place to hang on a hot day. feels just like home simple no frills coffee spot lots of outlets for computer peeps See all photos from Mindy H. for Vintage Heart Coffee ", neutral 
Vintage Heart Coffee ," 4/2/2014 1 check-in Listed in Austin Coffeshop Bucket List I wasn't really sure what to expect here from this interestingly located coffee shop. I had heard a lot of great things and with the up and coming EastSide, I figured it was worth checking out when I had some time to kill before pub quiz @ Gourmands.  I wasn't initially impressed when I walked into the almost barren interior with but a couple of choices on the menu. But, to my happy surprise they make a killer American for $2.75 (I LOVE that all the prices already include tax) and I also luv that they have Truvia sweetener (which is amaZingly hard to find these days).  I planted myself on the very comfy couch (I usually don't sit on coffeehouse couches being the germaphobe that I am, but this one just had that squishy look to it which made me think it would suck me in, which I luv...and I was right!) and got some work done w/the pretty quick wifi (I had a couple of recent experiences where the wifi at the cafes was incredibly slow!).  I also liked that they don't have disposable napkins or stirrers. My only complaint was the gal behind the counter was a bit cold and standoffish, but that seemed to be her demeanor in general. I wasn't expecting a hug and a cuddle-party when I walked in, but smile and some suggestions would have been nice.  I don't know that I would go out of my way, but I would probably come here again if I was in the area and needed a caffeine fix! Exterior View from the couch ", neutral

I came in on a Sunday morning and was one of only a couple people there. Good coffee for a decent price and some baked goods if you want. I came here after a bike ride and stumbled upon this shop on the East side. The décor is great and just feels like somewhere you'd want to hang out at.

You suddenly are inside of this well kept modern scenic coffee shop! Really the decor is partially why I love this place.

Vintage Heart Coffee ," 1/22/2015 I'm a sucker for cute little coffee shops and Austin definitely has a wide variety of them. Vintage Heart has to be one of my favorites!  First, the iced coffee is served in cute little mason jars. The iced vanilla latte is my preferred drink, and it's the perfect combo of sweet and creamy. Even on chillier days, I love to drink it. The interior is comfy and cozy, with a mixture of small tables, couches, and bar seating. I especially love the light fixtures!  The service is super friendly and the inside/bathrooms are clean, too!  The only downside I would have to add is that parking can be difficult (but when is it not in Austin...) and there aren't a ton of places to sit and study, especially if it's a busy day. There are a couple of tables outside, though, if you don't mind sitting outside. Either way, I love coming here to drink some good coffee and escape the school scene for a bit.

For the first time in my life, I would actually buy a larger serving of coffee if they sell it! I had the Latte and my girlfriend had the Mocha, and both were equally good. The location seems very homely, and unlike other famous/commercialized/both cafes, this place has a very welcoming feel to it. I was never a fan of Starbucks, which in my opinion, is not even worth being labeled coffee, and after going here, I hate Starbucks even more.

I usually get their full French press and share it with someone else, but all of their coffee options are delicious.

Fleet Coffee ," 11/17/2016 4 check-ins Listed in Caffeine Boost I hella love this place.  Patrick and Lorenzo are great. You can tell that they love coffee because of the great selection of beans and innovative drinks - they recently won Austin Chronicle's 'Coffee Innovation' award! They are incredibly knowledgeable and friendly too. I feel like each time I come, I'm picking their brains about brewing coffee at home. One time, Patrick gave me some grounds to compare for home and pellets to clean out my coffee grinder. Friendly, passionate, and knowledgable folks.  The drinks taste great, and the morning ritual is a nice 'treatyoself.'  I get excited each time I come to Fleet! Look forward to coming back again and again. ", pos 
Fleet Coffee ," 11/16/2016 1 check-in I liked this coffee shop a lot! It is a small place, but very comfortable. The barista is a excellent coffee maker and any kind of coffee you choose will be delicious. I prefer Latte without sugar and to follow a simple croissant. And so begins my day.  The place is close ACC Eastview, so you can visit after or before the class with friends. A Latte and a croissant ", pos 
Fleet Coffee ," 9/12/2016 4.5. The owners of Fleet Coffee are some of the best Baristas in town and their coffee shop is representative of their attention to detail and artistic abilities.  I'm always fascinated with the accentuated taste of a latte or Capuccino when there is artwork! Granted it is harder to take the first sip, because you won't want to mess up the latte art.  Fleet uses extremely high quality coffee beans to make their concoctions. Speaking of concoctions, they have several creations with ingredients you wouldn't typically think of combining.  They all mix well together and you'll start to stray from your usual cup of joe.  Grab a Saturday Morning Ritual infused with fruity pebble milk! They'll even put a homemade fruity pebble treat on the plate. They make them in-house (I've seen these bad boys coming out of the oven and being cut up for serving).  If you like your espresso with a bit of a citrus kick, indulge in the E.T.  It's brilliant.  If you just want a Capuccino, that's fine too. They're exquisite.  Check out their beautifully designed and built patio furnished with wood-crafted tables and chairs.  They have wifi too, if you need a spot to connect.  You'll love this place like I do. I hope. E.T.

Fleet Coffee ," 9/25/2016 1 check-in This adorbs coffee spot was a nice change than going to my usual. They had unique options in addition to the usual coffee and latte most places have. They serve cocktail style beverages that are really fun (served with coffee, no alcohol). Don't let the location scare you. It's up and coming, although at one point I had the ""where AM I?"" moment. My only complaint was that the place was rather small without much seating. After ten minutes of sitting inside I was feeling claustrophobic as the customers came in waves so I Ieft. Overall, cute spot. I'll be back! Saturday Morning Ritual mocktail. It was So good! coffee menu ", pos 
Fleet Coffee ," 6/1/2016 Fleet is great and definitely worth a stop (in addition to return visits). They take their coffee and tea seriously and you can tell. They churn out some tasty stuff with a unique spin here and there. For example, you really can taste the doughnut in their doughnut infused milk.  They have ample seating outside with narrow seating inside; if you've been here, you know what I mean. It works well. I hung out here for a while sipping my espresso and having some good conversation.  Patrick and Lorenzo are great themselves and have a really good thing going that I think many will appreciate. I look forward to return visits. Morning Ritual ", pos 
Fleet Coffee ," 9/8/2016 My new favorite coffee shop in Austin! (And that's saying something)  The interior is a bit small, and there's not a lot of seating, but it's cozy if you can find a seat. However, they have a larger outdoor patio, so when the weather is nicer, that'll be my go-to spot. I had the opportunity to chat with the owner, Patrick, and he's super nice and funny - it's nice to have a barista who chats with you and isn't stuck up! Their coffee is great and it comes in these bright blue cups that is aesthetically pleasing to me (#instaworthy). I will definitely come back to get a quick study sesh or to catch up with friends!

Fleet Coffee ," 5/10/2016 2 check-ins Listed in ""Nuptial Coffee Bliss!"" If you think it's tough following Austin's new restaurants, try keeping up with the coffee places. Fleet and Flitch are the newest local players, I think they're both great, and I'll meet you at either one. In fact, tell me which one you like, and I'll tell you what you are. Okay, I borrowed that line from a Starbucks in France.  I could tell you what beans they're using, but really, do you care? Trust Lorenzo's judgment. I benchmark places by their batch of straight black, but Fleet stops doing that around 3pm. I did think my $3.75 Madcap Spring Fling pour-over was some pretty good stuff. I know nothing about steamed milk or flavored concoctions.  I left here thinking what a clever use of interior design, it's easy to park, and this area of Webberville street sure is pretty interesting - hey, isn't that Gourmands & the new Dog & Duck Pub? Fleet takes their coffee seriously, you'll feel welcomed here, and there's Topo Chico & WiFi. Total fanville for me. 8 people can sit inside, it's a pretty clever design. Lots of outside space. That's my cup, btw. ", pos 
Fleet Coffee ," 11/30/2016 Coffee is excellent but very fully priced. Inside is tiny and seating is pretty uncomfortable. The interior is beautifully detailed and nice to look at. HOWEVER, every time I sit down inside to drink my coffee, I leave smelling like a stale ashtray. I think this is because the place is tiny and cigarette stink blows in the door from their front porch. Bottom line, I will grab a cup to go but not hang out for an extended period of time. ", pos 
Fleet Coffee ," 4/13/2016 Wonderful coffee shop! I went several weeks ago with a friend and all our kids. It was fairly straightforward to find, with parking in front. There are several picnic tables outside, which is always nice to find on a sunny, spring day in Austin! There is also lots of space outside that has the potential for either more tables or other things.  Inside, the shop is immaculately clean and simple. They designed the indoor space well considering the building itself is in a bit of a V shape. I know the shop is owned by two guys, one of whom I'm not familiar with, but Patrick I remember from Caffe Medici. I'm happy for the launch of his business, since I remember him being an exceptionally good barista at Medici.  They have a very creative menu. I wish I could remember off the top of my head some of the unique items they had, but on the day we came in we just kept it simple. I had a cafe au lait  with almond milk, which was excellent.  Service was great and very welcoming. Even the bathroom was clean, which is always appreciated when you go places with kids.  Hours are also easy to remember - 7 AM to 7 PM!  Definitely check out this place! Menu ", pos 
Fleet Coffee ," 3/31/2016 1 check-in I love this place. I'm a bit of a coffee aficionado and I know a good coffee shop when I visit one; this is the real deal. Just recently opened and running like a dream. The two owners are the sole baristas at this joint, and that seems to work because they are seemingly good friends (to customers and each other). Funnily enough, in talking to one of the baristas, we found that we had a few common friends from the KCMO coffee scene!! The coffee world is small[ish].  The indoor space at Fleet is tight, but I think it works to encourage people to spend some time outdoors or get friendly with their neighbors. The inside is a smallish trapezoid with a low bench online wall and a high bar at another (along the window). Outside, they have several picnic tables and who doesn't love some good ol' vitamin D?  They have the essential coffee items that one expects, but they also have some interesting drinks they've conjured up for the adventurous coffee drinker. A donut-infused milk drink, a root beer coffee beverage, and a delightfully crisp drink which I this is best described as a coffee version of a gin&tonic (obviously, minus the tonic). I tried the latter one on my second visit there, and it was AWESOME.  First time I visited, I asked for an iced pour over, and they said they could do that, but their iced coffee was actually brewed as a pour over and was ready à l'instant...so yeah, I went with that. It was some of the best iced coffee I've ever had.  I anticipate being rather regular at this coffee shop. Cheers!! I forget what this is called ", pos 
Fleet Coffee ," 5/19/2016 2 check-ins Though slightly hidden in East Austin, Fleet has a quaint but inviting exterior. Inside; however, is quite cramped. I think I would prefer to sit at one of the outdoor benches rather than try to squeeze myself in a spot inside. (Although, I hear they are expanding?)  As for the coffee - I ordered a plain latte, which was good, but didn't blow me away. I hear the ""Morning Ritual"" is a must-try, but I'm not a fan of donuts so I probably wouldn't order it!  The barista was very friendly - asked me what song requests I had, and had good music taste which was nice! Nonetheless, this definitely is not the place to sit and get work done over a cup of coffee. I think I would always grab it to go. outside Latte ", pos

Coffee is decent, drink menu is unique, iced americano (my go-to drink at new coffee shops) was really great.  THE LIDS ARE AWFUL. Half my coffee dripped away after leaking from the lid. OHHHH it made me so angry. Ridiculous gripe I know but these lids were almost as bad as the biodegradable ones that are put on cups with hot coffee...  I'll be back for their iced americanos...I'll bring my own cup next time. ", pos 
Fleet Coffee ," 7/14/2016 1 check-in My husband, my in-laws and I stumbled upon Fleet by accident last weekend; we were chasing a food truck that was unfortunately closed. Thankfully, we found this lovely little coffee shop right next door and ordered some of their third wave coffee.  Fleet's coffee is fresh and tasty, on par with the coffee I'm used to drink in Montreal. I had an iced almond milk latte and my husband had a double espresso; both were excellent. Fleet deserves a perfect rating for its coffee and courteous service.  The venue is cute but unusually shaped, and unfortunately sits only a few people at a time. Some partially shaded seats are available outside, leaving you at the mercy of the hot Texan temperatures. This is definitely a downside, however it would not refrain me from visiting again.  We are happy to have found a nice coffee shop in Austin and we will visit again for sure! ", pos 
Fleet Coffee ," 7/6/2016 Absolutely fantastic! This is my new favorite coffee shop in Austin. The art and passion for coffee-making shines through here.  Definitely try the Morning Ritual if you're a fan of donuts. Just do it, you won't regret it. They have two options for espresso and I tried both kinds in a cortado and they were delicious. They also have three different coffee beans for pour overs. Again, I tried all three and my taste buds were in heaven. The pastries and tacos are tasty as well.    The place itself is quaint and cozy with a chill atmosphere. Inside is a bit small but they have a patio with long tables so it's nice to sip delicious coffee outside.  Service is extremely friendly. I've been served by Lorenzo and Patrick and they both are always happy to strike up a conversation. It's intriguing watching them make drinks because their coffee-making process is so technical, precise and neat looking.

Fleet Coffee ," 10/5/2016 This shop is one of my favorites in Austin and there is a ton of competition in this city! The space is beautiful. Nothing extravagant, just enough. The barista was welcoming and knowledgable about everything we inquired about, even the tea and its benefits. A lot of coffee shops I've been to tend to know a lot about their coffee, but that's where it stops. The iced tea my mom had was tasty and helped her upset stomach. Our espresso was wonderful. We also ordered two seasonal drinks that were both creative and well balanced. They weren't too crazy or overly sweet and both tasted great. I kind of wish I had one right now.

Fleet Coffee ," 4/18/2016 1 check-in This coffee shop was a little bit of a drive from me, but with the great Yelp reviews and being a coffee lover I was game for driving to give it a try.  They have parking right in front of the store and are across from Dog and Duck Pub and Revolution BBQ.  It is a very small, but cozy set up.  There are a few small tables, a bar looking out the window with bar stools, and some outdoor seating.  The owner\barista is very friendly and is happy to answer any questions you may have about the coffee.  They have some very interesting and unique coffee choices which sets this shop apart from others.   I had to go with the morning ritual because who doesn't love a donut hole with their coffee.  Couldn't resist also trying a cold offering and the flip top (root beer, chicory, and coffee) caught my attention.  Neither coffees disappointed and overall it was a great experience and worthwhile trek. If you are a coffee lover this place should definitely be bookmarked and on your short list of coffee shops to visit.  I'm pretty sure you won't leave disappointed. The only thing I would say, I probably wouldn't plan on coming in a large group unless it is a nice day to sit outside.  Definitely a great place to enjoy some 1 on 1 conversation with someone however. Inside. Morning ritual See all photos from Charles Y. for Fleet Coffee ", pos 
Fleet Coffee ," 4/22/2016 2 check-ins Listed in Best of the East Side, Coffee Shops for Writers Fleet makes a fabulous addition to East Austin's cafe scene. I thank the coffee gods for bringing such a great small business to my neighborhood.  The cafe offers a bunch of original coffee concoctions. I prefer the simple espresso drinks, especially the macchiato. The coffee is Goldilocks perfect: not too hot, not too cold, not too bitter. But on a hot day, the Claro is great: this is Fleet's lemony twist on an ice-coffee meets beer shandy (without the beer).  If you are hungry Fleet offers pastries and tacos for breakfast. I'm not sure if there are all-day food offerings.  The space on quiet stretch of Webberville road is small with a simple aesthetic: concrete, wood, tile, and glass. There are two large picnic tables outside if you want to spread out. ", pos 
Fleet Coffee ," 4/15/2016 Very friendly guys running this cafe! I enjoyed my iced coffee, and The Morning Ritual (cortado infused with donuts) was on point! I really felt like I was drinking liquid donuts. They say they're looking at making drinks inspired by Momofuku Milk Bar so think something like fruity pebbles infused coffee. Yum.

Fleet Coffee ," 6/8/2016 38 check-ins This review is a long time coming, considering how often I go here -- I don't know much about coffee (not, say, as well as I should considering I'm a daily drinker), but I ran into one of the owners months and months before they opened and I was excited about his coffee pedigree and the location of the store -- right beside Lost Well, right across from Dog and Duck, a nice, much-needed convenient pre- or post-boozing coffee shop.  After months and months and months of delay, they finally opened, and I was there opening day. The place is smartly and tastefully designed inside, with an eye towards minimalist aesthetics (or aesthetic minimalism, if you prefer). The focus and passion here is coffee, and it shows.  I've been here multiple times, from morning to afternoon to early evening, and have been greeted warmly and by name by both Lorenzo and Patrick, the owners/baristas. They've guided me on a journey of coffee appreciation, and they'll recommend something new, or fix me an old standby with the same passion and dedication.  The prices are quite comparable to other coffee shops, they will make coffee to go, and they also sell bagged coffee.  I enjoy sitting at one on of the little tables inside, or at the window, reading, or working online (free wifi, yay!), or chatting with Lorenzo or Patrick if they aren't rushed or busy. I now no longer think that coffee is best served with copious amounts of half and half (I've never enjoyed black coffee until I started going to Fleet), and that coffee can have a flavor profile as every bit as complex and layered as a craft beer or bourbon.  The place is small but not cramped, not really a hang-out place, but there's only so much coffee one can consume in a sitting.  It's a warm, intimate, inviting place, and I have high hopes that they stick around, and I've recommended Fleet to friends and foes alike. Cappuccino by Lorenzo.... ", pos 
Fleet Coffee ," 5/5/2016 Knowledgeable baristas, a good selection of drip and espresso, and a beautiful space - Fleet Coffee is everything good in a coffee shop.

Fleet Coffee ," 5/9/2016 Newest coffee shop in Austin (as of this post) and it's a great addition to the Webberville area. Now the only major downside is it's size. This really isn't the type of place to go and hangout or try to get some work down as there are only about 3 tables and a counter area inside with something like 4 seats. There is also a table outside with about 6 seats (IIRC).  That being said, the coffee selection is superb. Also, the area itself is being developed so there are things to see and do. You can take your coffee to go and just kind of wander. I got myself an almond chai latter and did juts that. Staff was super friendly too. I would definitely return sometime for a cup. ", pos 
Fleet Coffee ," 3/27/2016 2 check-ins Fleet Coffee knows how to deliver when it comes to coffee! The small coffee shop offers a variety of coffees and tacos/pastry goods.  The shop's small size makes it more of a come and go place, where you drink coffee and catch up with friends, meet random friendly Austinites, lovers, ex-lovers (on second thought..), dogs, maybe even cats in strollers?  I ordered the Iced Latte and it was on point, and at a decent price. The Morning Ritual is something I'll have to try next time; who doesn't want a donut-infused espresso with a donut hole on the side?!

Fleet Coffee ," 4/26/2016 Normally when you think of a coffee shop what comes to mind is a spacious room with dim lighting and a pretty big focus on the interior design. However with Fleet this notion has been turned on its head; for all the right reasons.  The interior of Fleet is quite small, and while this may take away from being able to sit on some huge armchair and either pass out or space out on a laptop; it encourages the people in that space to converse with one another, or better yet the barista behind the counter.  As is a hallmark of Lorenzo's attention to detail, the staff at Fleet are incredibly passionate and knowledgeable about the product they are serving & I highly recommend getting into conversations about the quality of the beans they receive, because they'd be more than happy to tell you.  Since (as stated previously) the space is small I also recommend visiting during an off hour so you can enjoy the coffee without having to wait in a long line out the door, but no matter what, you're bound to have a great experience visiting Fleet.

Fleet Coffee ," 3/31/2016 Fleet Coffee finds itself situated on a burgeoning strip of Webberville, with modern architecture and large windows defining this new age of retail. Right next door, you could have a two-fer during your afternoon 'spro and beer combo; Dog and Duck has relocated next door to Fleet.  Some folks from Medici made their way to the deep East to begin providing quality coffee below Figure 8. I can appreciate the way they have married design and coffee here at their new shop.  The quarters are tight and small, but if you can land a spot, you could cozy up for a full work day here. Layout is not ideal for long hours, as it stands, but the coffee will keep you coming back.

Fleet Coffee ," 5/28/2016 Listed in Austin Cafes: Coffee vs Community or Both! I made a special trip here within weeks of its opening, not being on the way to anywhere I go, now that my primary commute is to the Eastside from Northwest Austin. In Cherrywood for the summer, so I hope to return soon, and to find that they haven't expanded their menu or space since my first trip. This scaled back edition of the minimalist coffee shop aesthetic is scaled up in intimacy and attention to detail. How could it not be, though, there's nowhere to hide?! Hah. I ordered my standard for comparison, The Americano, and it stacked up. Actually, I remember it being better than average, but can't remember why. More incentive to return soon. It seems to have become a crowd pleaser among Yelpers, mostly people making special trips like me, which leaves me wondering how many local people know about it. The size constraint does not make it ideal for setting up shop, but that is what makes Fleet exceptional, the smaller internet cafes in Austin are wall-to-wall with Macbook drones, too, whereas this one is just small enough to best serve people walking through the neighborhood, who want a quality coffee to-go.

I wrote a whole post about my experience at this coffee shop. You can read more and see a ton of my photos on my blog - zoyaandme.com. The holiday decorations at Mozart's are really pretty!See more photos from the trip here on my blog http://zoyaandme.com/. Loved the sunset on the Lake while at Mozart's.

Mozart’s Coffee Roasters ," 10/8/2016 I visited with a friend and I really liked the place!  They have a wide variety of desserts and plenty of drinks to choose from! I had a lemon bar and a chai latte - both of which were great and I can't wait to try more. Customer service was good - they were really good about making sure everyone was tended to. The lighting inside was a bit dark for my taste, so I'm not sure it's the best place to get work done at night, but the location is great and there is plenty of seating outside that overlooks a lake. I went at nighttime, but I'll definitely be back during the day to enjoy the view on a good weather day.  Overall this place was great and I can't wait to go back! ", pos

Mozart’s Coffee Roasters ," 9/26/2016 Such an awesome place to have some coffee or baked goods. There is free wifi and both indoor and outdoor seating. The view is spectacular of lake Travis. There are fishes, ducks, and turtles on the lake.  Parking in the area is a bit limited due to having more than one restaurant there. If you don't find parking in that same lot, there is more parking  across the street.  I had the mozart's mocha special which tasted so good. I will definitely be back again.

This place has more out door seating than indoor. That's because they have a big patio that is two stories high. It looks over a beautiful lake. You can watch people riding their boats, jet skis, etc.  They had so many choices of drinks it was hard to choose! I tried their latte on tap and it was really good! who knew! ice latte on tap? The price range is just a little on the pricey side but i think its worth :)  I really enjoyed coming here with my best friend. I would definitely recommend this place for any occasion ^^ Hazelnut Latte Large ", pos 
Mozart’s Coffee Roasters ," 11/23/2016 1 check-in This is a pretty famous cafe. On the weekends, it's usually so busy that you have to park in a parking lot up the street. The cafe has a board walk type vibe and you can sit in a lovely indoor patio overlooking a nice view of the water. The coffee is strong. But I gave this place an extra star because of the combination of the view and the pastry selection. They had honest to god home made churros that were to die for! ", pos 
Mozart’s Coffee Roasters ," 6/18/2016 Stunning location and the view is astonishing! Huge patio with lots of seating, most people here take up the indoor spots for all day, lots of tourists. It can be very distractive at times, especially sometimes there are a lot of children running on the deck!  Jazz live music on the weekend is very relaxing (it's free, so tip please). Coffee is pretty good for the price, house mocha is my favorite. It is very rich and chocolate makes study a bit more enjoyable.  Pastries are okay. Sometimes the cake has the old /fridge taste. Nasty! But most of the time, cakes are pretty good.  Wifi is extremely poor here. Very hard to get things done while trying to connect to their internets over and over again. ", neutral

There are times when I come and get the best service and other times, the employees act like I'm an annoyance. The pastries are okay, but I wouldn't say it's worth the drive to come all the way out here and get them.  The thing I like about this place is coming during the winter holidays. There are lights strewed on the wall and it's cute to watch. They have a nice patio where you could bring your drinks and pastries and enjoy them outdoors with a cute little view. ", neutral 
Mozart’s Coffee Roasters ," 4/17/2016 5 check-ins Tons of drink and pastry choices. The parking is minimal but there is parking across the street. All things aside .. the best thing about this place is the ambience and the view of the water. They have yearly events around Christmas and do an amazing light show with music. It really is amazing and worth sitting out in the cold weather for a few minutes! There are usually a lot of students during the school year but you don't feel shy because there are plenty of adults there, too! hehe  I really love this place and would go here all the time if it were closer to where I live. Thankfully they are a ways out for me so I don't end up spending a fortune on their drinks and sweets.  The service isn't the best so just be patient and remember the view is awesome! :D ", pos 
Mozart’s Coffee Roasters ," 7/24/2016 1 check-in Mozart's was the first place I was asked to visit when I said I was moving to Austin, 6 years ago. Since then, I've been here a few times, and have always found it a bit overwhelming. The location can't be beat- on the lake, plenty of seating (outdoors particularly hellish in the summer) and sweet treats including Amy's ice cream. Coffee, free wifi, and the occasional duck on the lake. Pretty place. There's live music at times, too. If you're the type that doesn't care that it's touristy and crowded at all times, if you can tune out all the noise, and if you can find a seat indoors (for most of the year), you'll love it. You'll also love it if you're a people watcher. All kinds come and go here. Also, expect to have slightly stale cake in the evening. ", neutral 
Mozart’s Coffee Roasters ," 7/19/2016 1 check-in Mozart's is in a great spot on Lake Austin!  The view is amazing!  It is a bit touristy here, which is ok sometimes.  Other times it can feel a bit crowded here.  The tea is good and the hot chocolate is awesome!  It is a little expensive in my opinion, but they have options which is nice.  During the holidays they do a laser light show ... for FREE which is so nice of them.  Beware it draws a ton of people.  Even though there is a huge crowd I felt like it was organized and done well, but I probably wouldn't come back because of the crowd.  The outside deck offers lots of seating in addition to the indoor space.  Mozart's a cool spot to check out if you ask me. ", neutral 
Mozart’s Coffee Roasters ," 5/14/2016 Updated review 1 check-in I give This 4-stars because of its beautiful views of the lake and the ambiance in general.  Their coffee and tea is not anything that has blown me away. It's definitely good, but not much different than other cups of coffee and tea you can find around the area.  On the other hand, the views from the coffeehouse are unbeatable by any other coffeehouse in Austin. You can relax and just watch the sunset while you study or work. It's a great place to meet with friends (both small and big groups) because of the amount of seating available. The cafe is almost always full during peak hours, but there is good enough turnover so that you should be able to find seating fairly quickly. The outdoor seating is also perfect for those days that Austin weather cooperates.  Their deli items are good, but again, not much different than you could get at a typical cafe in Austin.  I definitely recommend coming here, though, during your visit to Austin, especially for the view. ", pos

Mozart’s Coffee Roasters ," 10/9/2016 Great coffee with bottomless cold brew and pastries. You can watch the coffee bring ground up in the corner, then walk outside and enjoy the view on Lake Austin. Parking is a bit of a mess, but the view is well worth it. ", pos 
Mozart’s Coffee Roasters ," 5/5/2016 1 check-in Come for the coffee and stay for the view. This place has amazing reviews and it deserves it. It sits on the lake and there's a couple of restaurants nearby.  They have a good amount of options for dessert. I got a tiramisu and Mexican hot chocolate. The tiramisu was too dry unfortunately. The Mexican hot chocolate tastes exactly like ""Abuelita Hot Chocolate"" which isn't a bad thing!  Lots of seating outside, inside not so much. This was a must stop in Austin. ", pos 
Mozart’s Coffee Roasters ," 8/2/2016 Let's start with the fact that the view and feel of this place is just simply the best. I wish I lived in Austin just to come here every weekend and sip on coffee.  Shaded porch overlooking the lake, so peaceful, I can't imagine a better place to relax with a cup coffee. We only ordered an Iced Draft Latte and hot vanilla latte but they were both fantastic. Would definitely return!  Note, bring your pup to relax with you and enjoy the free wifi! Honestly I wouldn't want to spend a Sunday morning anywhere else! ", pos

Mozart’s Coffee Roasters ," 6/20/2016 1 check-in I have no idea how the coffee is at Mozart's. I've always been here late in the evening, so I've just never had the coffee, or at least I don't remember it if I have. The Italian sodas are good, and the ice creams (Amy's) and desserts are quite good. Add the lakeside and the live music and the crowd, and usually it's a magical combo that's greater than the sum of it's parts.  Quintessentially Austin. ", pos 
Mozart’s Coffee Roasters ," 12/20/2015 1 check-in I am reviewing their light show! Mozart's light show is absolutely amazing. It blows my mind every year, and it's different every year! There are some songs that are the same but they do always change it up. There is plenty of seating and they don't pressure you to buy anything while you watch the show. Mozart's light show is definitely something you must see when you're in Austin for the christmas time. Pre-light show ", pos

Mozart’s Coffee Roasters ," 11/21/2015 1 check-in Listed in Vegetarian Food + Austin This is my kind of place. Beautiful view of a lake. Peaceful atmosphere. And a lot of outdoor seating.  Clearly other people also enjoy this place. The number of tables available here is insane, but it was still nearly impossible to find seats on a gorgeous Sunday afternoon. We wandered around and kept finding more floors and more taken seats. We finally found a table on the corner of the second floor that was free.  Things I noticed while wandering: The lower floors were much quieter than the top ones. Indoor seating is very limited, so probably not a good idea to chill here if it's hot or raining.  I'm not a coffee person, so I was looking at teas/smoothie/dessert options available on their menu when we arrived. Then I saw they had gelato. Then I saw they had vegan gelato. Yes! I ordered the vegan gelato which was a blended combination of different berries. It was delicious.  Parking will probably be a struggle, but they have a larger lot across the street.  I wish Houston had more coffee shops like this. If only it wasn't a concrete jungle. Vegan gelato ", pos 
Mozart’s Coffee Roasters ," 6/21/2016 This place is the very definition of Austin, or at least what I think it is. Coffee, live music, and outdoor seating by the lake...doesn't that just scream Austin?  Came with a friend on a Thursday night around dinner time and found that it was surprisingly pretty crowded. The inside is pretty nice although most of the appeal, I suppose, is in the outdoor area where they had someone singing. Additionally, their bathrooms are located outdoors if that's any indication. Nonetheless, they still have plenty of seats indoors if that's not really your scene.  The people working there were super friendly even though my friend and I asked way too many questions and took forever to pay.  Even though it was nearly 100 degrees, I ordered a hot vanilla latte and an espresso mousse cake. I thought the latte was fine, although it was a little bitter for me (someone who doesn't like coffee). The dessert I got seemed overpriced to me, especially considering how mediocre I found it to be. It was literally just a dry cake doused in espresso, kind of a weird juxtaposition if you ask me.  But I'm still giving this place 4 stars because I really just love the vibe and the coffee honestly is good enough for me. Also, their other desserts look really good so I'll have to come back and try them another time! Vanilla Latte and espresso mousse cake ", pos 
Mozart’s Coffee Roasters ," 11/13/2015 Nice place to get coffee with a view. it has a huge outdoor deck area that sits on the lake. Pet friendly.  They carry your regular coffee shop fixes. Drip coffee, espressos, blended drinks. And then there is ice cream, a huge variety of baked goods and a few food items. Had the empanadas and quiche before. Both pretty good. not anything extraordinary but perfect for something to have with my coffee for a light breakfast.  Fun light show on the deck during the holiday season.  If you are in the area, definitely stop by! Latte and quiche with a view of the lake! ", pos

Mozart’s Coffee Roasters ," 9/11/2016 Love this place. Can't get much better than sitting on the edge of the lake sipping a delicious cappuccino and watching the ducks and turtles.  Plenty of shade and seating outside.  Service is usually very good for as busy as they get. If they forget something, they always hop right on it. That's only happened once in a couple years.  The cappuccino is a proper drink as well with full ristretto shots and a creamy foam on top.  I had the strawberry cheesecake this past weekend and it was incredible. Creamy and whipped, light, and rich flavor.  The parking is tough but across from lake Austin Blvd you can park in the extra lot. ", pos

They're coffee drinks are delicious.  Their desserts are a wonderful way to end a meal.  Even if the parking lot looks super packed, and the lines are long...there are plenty of seating available.

The location is what makes this place somewhere I keep coming back to - so much outside space there's always a sunny spot (or a shady one if you're so inclined) to sit in.  The coffee is good, not great, but definitely good - and they are always super accommodating of special requests.  Pastries are better than they look.  Mid range prices, ever charming service and good wifi mean I'll never complain about coming here for a meeting or a catch up. ", pos

If this sounds like your cup of Morning Joe, this place will rock your socks!  However, if you're actually there to taste test their coffee like some kind of San Francisco snob *cough*, then you might not be so impressed. It's pretty average affair coffee -- we tried both a latte and a mocha, both fell pretty short. Milk tasted a bit overdone and the mocha wasn't anything special, just tons of syrup that ended up making the beverage too sweet to even enjoy.  It's a nice relaxing place to study or work, but just don't come expecting mind-blowing coffee. ", neutral

I came here to get a flat white and they were a little confused about what I was asking for. This really looks like one of those mass production, touristy type of coffee places, except that they have free wifi, food, lots of (not so good) pastries, and an amazing outdoor space you can hang out in.  The inside is madness, there are usually two lines to order but you can't really tell, people don't really know what they want and spend anywhere between 5-10 minutes ordering sometimes two drinks. The drinks are ok, but the atmosphere is fun. The staff is friendly (but confused) and is eager to help in whatever you need. I enjoyed my ""flat white"" despite the coffee being quite bitter and the shot burned, because the deck is awesome.  The parking here is also dismal.

Mozart’s Coffee Roasters ," 12/9/2015 2 check-ins This place is great to drink a coffee and have a pie seeing a beautiful view. I've been there couple times and the atmosphere is very nice, especially because of the lake! I already tried apple pie and cannoli and of course many types of coffee. The apple pie is good but I didn't like the cannoli....just nothing special and no taste. People go there with family and groups and there are many students using tables with their computers. This month of December they have show of lights with Christmas song every end of each hour. Parking is free and is crowded but there are many spots in both sides of the street. I think almost $7 dollars for a small pie is expensive, maybe they are charging this price because there are many tourists and visitors over there. Most part of staff is friendly. They have wifi but it doesn't work because many people are trying to use it at the same time. So....I think the view worth it more than everything at this place. 4 stars because food and coffee are ok, nothing special to me and really expensive.

They have a private lot but it fills up pretty quickly and I was fortunate to get a parking spot. If I didn't, then across the street there's additional parking. When I go down the stairs there's a huge patio with people on their laptops and dogs just relaxing. When you enter there's two lines, it didn't occur to me to go to the other line which was shorter. Then again, I was thinking straight because lo and behold, there's the dessert display which is basically my kryptonite. Damn!  I was intrigued by the row of dessert cups and I tried the brownie tres leches which was so good. It went well with my iced coffee. What was even better was they had unlimited refills on iced coffee.

The coffee is pretty good, and they have a lot of food options, including breakfast tacos (some of which are vegetarian or vegan), pastries, baked goods, and desserts!  There's a lot of parking in front of the store, but there's also a big lot across the street!  It can get busy though!  Definitely a great place to sit and drink some coffee and relax!

Mozart’s Coffee Roasters ," 4/10/2016 I really like this place! though giving 3.5 stars. Here's why:  Pros: This is located in a beautiful west side of Austin, right next to the river. Great view from its patio. They offer variety of sweets/drinks at moderately high price, but some are still affordable. It gets pretty packed on weekends with young adults/college students.This is the place for people watching in Austin.  Cons: Wifi is not reliable at all. It's ridiculously slow and cut off every 3 minutes - so this is not a place for you if you are here to do some work on your laptop. It is a nice spot for reading a book or chatting with friends though! Their shared restroom needs some work as well. When I used it today, one still had a poop(eeeeeewww!) floating and the other one had no lock at the door...it was a hard choice, but I made it through... ", neutral

I love going on Saturday nights when they have live music on the dock/patio - couple the music with amazing coffee and the breathtaking view of the lake and you've an amazing place to sit, chill, chat with friends, and/or lounge around all night long.  Coffee is also really nice - they roast their coffees in house and their selections of drip coffee blends have varied nicely every time I've gone. It's like $3 for bottomless coffee - great deal and great coffee (all of their coffees are smooth with no astringency). They also have pastries, cakes, and ice cream; though I haven't tried any of them...I just stick with the coffee.  All in all, it's a great place to relax, study, bring out of town friends/family, etc.! ", pos

When the sunsets, and you're enjoying a coffee on the deck overlooking the lake -- take a look at the couples around you who are ogling at each other and you know that some babies are definitely being made.  As I look at the sunset and sip my warm coffee I feel eyes ogling at me. Could it be? I look around me, guy at the other end of the beautiful deck? Nope.

Mozart’s Coffee Roasters ," 1/14/2016 This place is awesome during any time of the year. Christmas is my favorite time to go because we usually get a couple coffees, sit on the main deck and watch the light show. They offer a cold drink, some sort of iced macchiato that is extremely sweet tasting and delicious. Their brownies and chocolate cakes are delectable, but their version of pumpkin pie left us a little unsatisfied.  A wonderful place to hang out. Part of the decorations for their Christmas light show. ", pos

Mozart’s Coffee Roasters ," 2/17/2015 1 check-in Listed in desserts & sugar I'm not a huge fan of studying at coffee shops, which is maybe the reason why I've only been to this Austin classic a couple of times. I love how it overlooks the lake and how large the space is. There are steps that lead downstairs, and you can eat, read, study, and sip your coffee on what feels like a dock overlooking the lake. It's pretty cool. It also has a super chill feel to it - even the writing scratched into the old wooden tables adds to that feel, as weird as it sounds.  I've gotten to try a lot of their dessert over the past couple of years, and they have a huge selection of them as well as dessert drinks. Absolutely loved their tiramisu cheesecake - it was the perfect blend of sweetness from the cream, tartness from the cream cheese, and bitterness from the espresso flavor. It also had a perfect blend of all ingredients and textures. Easily one of the best not-tiramisu-but-still-tiramisu desserts I've ever had. carrot cake, caramel chocolate chip cheesecake, tiramisu cheesecake ", pos 
Mozart’s Coffee Roasters ," 7/18/2016 3 check-ins Listed in Austin - Favorite Food Places I am really surprised that Mozart's is not having over 1000 reviews because this is THE place that people visit for a good cup of coffee, a bite of sweet dessert, and a wonderful time with your friends and family. I wish I can actually count how many times I visited here; unfortunately, I can't because it's too many. I first found Mozart's when I was in college. It has been here for ... like forever. All UT students visit here for coffee, meeting, or for a good time. It can get pretty crowded, especially during the school time. Parking can get difficult but there is a parking lot across street from it that should provide a lot more spaces. I love it's next to a lake. It's spacious with lots of tables for all groups. For their coffee, I like their latte either hot or cold will work. On a hot Austin summer day, I like the ice cold latte. All the good memories I had here say a lot about this place. It's hard to describe the atmosphere here at Mozart's because you will have to visit to see it yourself. This is the place I will visit when I come back to Austin. ", pos

Bottomless coffee and iced coffee! You can get enough coffee for $4 to fuel a Himalayan expedition.  The bad: the food is blah. At least you're not paying $$$$ for it, just $$, so what you're actually paying is a location tax. I had a slice of quiche, and I think it was bacon spinach but I can't remember because it was unremarkable.  7/10, I would come here again to impress visitors, or to study all day. Not for quiche.

Mozart’s Coffee Roasters ," 12/30/2014 2 check-ins Nothing beats the combination of a beautiful outdoor scenery, hot coffee, and a slice of German chocolate cake. Mozart's has it all!  The scenery here makes it a perfect place to hang out with friends or take a date for coffee and dessert. Indoor seating provides the comfort of a climate controlled room while still offering nice views of the river with their large windows. The only disadvantage with indoor seating is finding a spot to actually sit! Outdoor seating is even better with their spacious deck and multitude of benches and tables. If you get a table near the river, you can watch the sun set as you share your moment with your date (or mom, depends on whoever you end up taking!).  During the Christmas Holiday's, they set up a spectacular music and Christmas light show on their patio. The show is several minutes long and is suitable for both kids and adults. I was very impressed the first time I saw the show and it made a very memorable Holiday experience. They play it several times a night, but I don't remember the time intervals so it is best to call to find the exact times.  Great place to hang out for coffee, scenery, desserts, and Christmas light show. This place is a must-go if you are ever visiting Austin. Plan this in your itinerary after you check out Mt. Bonnell (which is only about a ten minute drive).  Parking is not easy here since the complex is usually full, especially during weekends, nights, and holidays. Street parking is also available if the lot is full. Delicious slice of chocolate cake with a cup of coffee Dusk Sometimes the river runs low and the scenery isn't that great. It all depends on what time of the year you go! See all photos from Danny L. for Mozart's Coffee Roasters ", pos 
Mozart’s Coffee Roasters ," 1/9/2016 I've been to Mozart's several times for meetings, with friends, and by myself. The number 1 reason I go back is because of their location on the lake.  The coffee isn't special by Austin standards, no pour over, french press, or other small batch brew methods. If you want brewed coffee, the only option is their bottomless cup which is somewhere around $3 so the price is great and the quality isn't something I'd tell everyone about but it's not bad by any means.  They also have a wide dessert selection that I haven't tried, but several friends have and said they were good.  During the day they can be a little busy and crowded inside, but if the weather is nice you should consider sitting on the deck anyway. Definitely worth a stop if you're in the area or want to drink coffee with a great view. ", pos 
Mozart’s Coffee Roasters ," 12/20/2015 Went Friday night after a big meal downtown. The Christmas lights show was spectacular as usual. My cortado was tasty and the fruit cheesecake was fabulous also. I thought that the chocolate mousse was boring and more like a Snak-Pak than a real mouse. The tiramisu was elegant, moist and just sweet enough.    The location is fabulous, however with the cold wind blowing over the water in the winter it would be nice to have some source of heat. My family and I got quite cold. ", pos

But my sweet tooth won out. I ordered the raspberry and orange with a bottomless coffee. I really like that they have soy and almond milk in the self serve area. The medium blend I got was really delicious, the flavors melded perfectly together, not too strong or intense. I also hd the lake austin blend and I really enjoyed it (the lighter blend). The fruit tart was amazing. I could sing its praises for hours. The tart shell is thin and coated in chocolate, the pastry cream was ABSOLUTELY to die for, it wasn't too sweet. I don't like thin crusts and I loved this one.  Today was perfect for sitting outside and just enjoying the weather/watching the water. I like Mozart's vibe, atmosphere and  coffee. ", pos 
Mozart’s Coffee Roasters , 12/14/2015 It was pretty crowded for a Sunday night. Not sure if it is always like that for the Christmas lights or if it was because the Trail of Lights was closed for the night. Needless to say they seemed pretty well prepared for the crowd and there wasn't too long of a line for hot chocolate because they had a number of places around where you could buy that and other treats. The light show was very fun to watch and reminded me of a way smaller version of the Osborne Lights at Walt Disney World. I would definitely recommend going there for some holiday cheer and delicious hot chocolate. Only thing is there weren't very many bathrooms so make sure you go before you get there! , pos

Mozart’s Coffee Roasters ," 7/19/2015 I really like this place a lot.  If I lived in Austin, I would probably treat Mozart's the same way I treated Urth Caffe in Los Angeles - a great spot serving excellent coffee and desserts on a relaxing outdoor deck which is a good place to bring friends or to get some work done.  By Austin standards, it's a bit pricey, but you're paying for the friendly service and the tables on the water, which are well worth spending another couple of bucks.  This isn't a place to grab coffee and breakfast on the way to work or to the airport, but if you need to kill a couple of hours on a nice day during the weekend, Mozart's is your place.

I've been here before, and the biggest complaint I've heard is ""it's too expensive."" Now, I don't know if it's new or I just never knew before, but they have unlimited iced tea or hot coffee for $3.50, and unlimited iced coffee for $4.75. You can even add flavors (I had 3 glorious cups of pumpkin spice today, haha)!! I don't know if their roasts are good, or if they grind well, or any of that classy stuff, but it's unlimited, man.  My biggest complaint would be WiFi, space, and electric outlets. Yes, there's already a LOT of space, and they try hard with the outlets. It's just still risky, so if you can, go early, claim a spot, and don't leave till you're done. WiFi seemed to work for some, but not me at all. I ended up hotspotting when I needed to, then just working offline the rest of the time.  It's also an interesting demographic mix, since you'll see touristy folks and older people, then a ton of college kids studying. Can get a little noisy if you're doing hardcore work.  I mean, with a lake (isn't it actually a river?) view, unlimited drinks, and a hipster and classy vibe, what more can you ask for? Coffee cake + iced coffee w/a pump of chocolate syrup ", pos

Summermoon Coffee Bar ," 12/4/2016 Moon milk.  Condensed milk? evaporated milk? Sugar? honey? Half and Half? LITERAL milk from the moon? A mix of all of the above? ...probably.  No one knows whats in it, but man are the coffees with moon milk in them GOOD. Basically, Summer Moon has a milk concoction called ""Moon Milk"" that they put in their Winter Moon (iced) and Summer Moon (hot) coffee varieties. You can choose how much moon milk is in your drinks by getting a straight up FULL summer/winter moon (a little sweet for me, personally), half, or even requesting a quarter (not on the menu). My personal favorite is the half winter moon (I personally am not a fan of hot drinks - but the half summer moon is good too!)  If you're not into sweet deliciousness, you can also get more basic coffees/lattes (good beans, good flavor) and teas.  For FOODS, you can get had pies (personal fave is the goat cheese with red pepper and caramelized onion), sandwiches, baked goods, and breakfast tacos.  100% great place to hang out! 5 stars.

I keep coming back so I guess I caught feelings for summer moon.  I tried out the moon menu with the moon milk that they use and I find that the ""moon menu"" is basically a dessert in a cup. I find that a good coffee on that moon menu is the half winter moon, if you're looking for ""a pick me up"" that's not too overly sweet or bitter. And we can't forget the mocha moon!! It's like a chocolate expresso and everything you can ask for :)  This place is a bit pricey as it adds up but it's actually cheaper than Starbucks and it's way better quality ingredients!!  The 16 oz is around 3-4$ that's cheaper than Starbucks if you order a grande (16 oz) and that already ranges to $4-5 for an iced coffee with some pumps of white mocha.  100/10 way to go, Summer Moon.

They have a beautiful interior with plenty of seating for the area, fast wifi for my remote friends and friendly staff that light up the already bright space. I drive up to this location from my East Side Coffee-haven just because it's so damn impressive.  I'm not a caffeine snob, so I can't really comment on the quality of the coffee. I'd imagine the rankings would look something like this: Above McDonalds; Below the coffee Beyonce drinks. Yep, it's probably firmly nestled in between those. I will note that their house coffee (which is what I get 99% of the time) is alway freshly brewed, which is welcomed.  Overall check out their new spot up here on Burnet, it's worth the drive.

Summermoon Coffee Bar ," 8/31/2016 1 check-in A friend recommended the moon milk here, so I got the Winter Moon (iced latte with moon milk and espresso). I got my latte shortly after placing the order. The Winter Moon, which claims to have seven secret ingredients, has a general flavor of caramel. It was very sweet and it was thicker than your typical latte, due to the moon milk in it. Don't underestimate the drink; even a size small is quite heavy and it will probably take longer for you to finish than other lattes. This isn't the type of drink I'd have daily because of how sweet and heavy it is, but it can definitely be a treat every once in a while.

It is no mystery while this place is always hopping. I do wish they had more room for seating, as there never seems to be ample seating for everyone.

Sure, the shop specialty blend ""moon milk"" sounds a little sketchy, but once you had it in your choice of coffee, you wouldn't think twice about drinking something called ""moon milk""! While the wood-roasted coffee beans already adds a nice aroma to the coffee, ""moon milk"" adds an unique delicious taste that is perfectly sweet.  Whether you like your coffee hot or cold, in the form of latte or cappuccino, just choose a drink that has the word ""moon"" on the menu and you'll be good to go!

The moon milk is delicious but VERY sweet. It is a special blend of secret ingredients that they make themselves.  I found out that I can just ask them to reduce the level of sweetness when ordering a drink with moon milk (Very cool!).  I also love their affrogato's with Lick ice cream.

Summermoon Coffee Bar ," 11/16/2016 Summermoon is just wonderful. They have a huge menu of options, not to mention their specialty ""moon milk"" which they use in their drinks. It is heavenly! I've even bought some and used it when making french toast and it was delicious!! The staff is amazingly friendly, absolutely will remember your name and what your usual is, and they make the most divine coffee. This location gets slammed around 7:45 during the week, but it drops off by 9. The space itself is warm and inviting if you're looking for a place to read or work, or just visit with a friend.  My go to is a Half Moon Latte, which is 1/2 moon milk and half regular milk. It is just the right amount of sweetness for me. This morning I tried their Vanilla Chai Latte and it was so creamy!! It isn't as spicy as some chai's are, so just a heads up about that. Their Summermoon Latte is also amazing, it is made with all moon milk, but be warned it is sweet!  They also have affogato, nitrobrew, various baked good, handpies, and sell TacoDeli breakfast tacos! What more can you ask from a coffee place? Oh and they have a rewards program, after 10 visits you get a free drink. I think it only applies if you pay with a card though, but it's nice that they offer it.

Summermoon Coffee Bar ," 3/23/2016 19 check-ins I love this place.  Delicious coffees of all kinds. I'm particularly fond of the winter half moon, which I inhale as if I had been wandering in the dessert for months/starving to death/dieting for a year. Rich and smooth and delicious. Even if you get it with soy, it doesn't detract from the taste at all. I also really enjoyed the rich drip coffee. And all the baked goods, but especially that banana bread. Just take my money please.  I think the difference comes down to their beans. When you have well roasted beans and good baristas/technique, you really can't go wrong.  But really, staff is nice and work very hard. They never stop moving (I once watched them from the bar for pretty much an entire day...) and are excellent at what they do. The orders come out quickly and well made. I also love the decor. I love how plentiful outlets and chairs are.  Everything is great! Come here!

Seriously what's in the moon milk? I guess if we knew the secret, we wouldn't be coming back for more! This may sound weird but it almost taste buttery to me. I've been back several times and always order the same thing since it's so good and consistently good every single time.

Summermoon Coffee Bar ," 3/29/2016 1 check-in My buddy Eory was in the mood for some coffee after lunch at Shake Shack, and he recommended this place.  Knowing I'm quite a coffee fiend he knew I'd take the bait..    The place looks like a cool contemporary coffee spot,  which is very nice.  It sets them apart from your typical ""too cool to look contemporary cool"" coffee joints.    The staff behind the bar was very kind and gave great suggestions for what I was wanting to try.  The hooked me up with an Espresso ConPanna and an iced coffee blended with their in house sweetened milk creamer.  The espresso was dynamite!  A nice bitter sweet dragon punch to my tastebuds finished off with just enough sweetness to calm it down.  Loved it!  The iced coffee was also a great surprise. It was bold but not acidic and the sweet milk cream did an amazing job of thickening it without making it too sweet.  My buddy and I spent the next hour just chillin talkin while sippin our iced coffees.  Normally I put these away quickly but it was too good to not enjoy slowly.  The mood of the place is mellow and relaxed.  Definitely a place I'd like to visit again.    Best of all was the price!  Normally for two premium drinks like that I'd pay over $8 at most other coffee spots but here it was just over $5 and that is one hell of a bang for your buck!  Highly recommend you check it out if you're in the mood for a mellow place to enjoy premium coffee at a great price! Close up of the espresso ConPanna Ice coffee and espresso ConPanna Menu shot!

Summermoon Coffee Bar , 7/25/2016 1 check-in What is moon milk!? I will never know but I will be forever thankful for it. For some reason their summer moon/winter moon tastes a bit different from the south location. It's still good but seems a little stronger/less sweet? Not sure lol I also really like coming in the morning for some TacoDeli breakfast tacos (that is if I come before they run out).  This is definitely one of my new favorite study spots since I moved north. They have a good amount of big open tables and it seems like a lot of people come to just get work done. There are always rushes of people and groups just socializing but I still find it very easy to concentrate. There's just a magical balance of noise and music. I also really like the music they play which helps with my productivity.  The only thing I wish they did was stay open later. 8pm seems pretty early for a coffee shop but I guess I'm used to living near campus where more students need those late night coffee shops. It's unfortunate but I guess it makes me want to get work done faster. Summermoon Latte , pos 
Summermoon Coffee Bar ," 7/13/2016 1 check-in Stopped by this little gem right after my lunch at Chi'lantro yesterday. I am always in the mood for a little caffeine pick me up - I blame my years as a night shifter. The place is adorable with an ""exposed brick wall"" and semi resto-hardware industrial vibe. There is free wifi - probably a must for a coffee bar.  There is a menu board with all the usual latte suspects plus a few signature mixes. I had a moonbeam or something like that. I don't remember the name, but it made a delightfully refreshing mid day perk-me-up. I'd stop by again, if I were in the hood. I probably wouldn't cross town for it, but I'm lazy like that. ", pos 
Summermoon Coffee Bar ," 7/16/2016 2 check-ins It's been over an year since I heard of Summer Moon.  The hype over their moon milk was enticing, and I was truly interested.  However, the long delay of me trying it was caused by the combination of being no where close to a Summer Moon (fueled by laziness of driving through downtown), and I wasn't sure if they had lactose-free substitutes of their Moon Milk.  I was at the Chilantro next door with a large party and a couple of them headed over the Summer Moon for coffee.  I asked and they had almond and soy substitutes, and this place was definitely much closer and more easily accessible.  The opportunity was finally here!  After a 100-plus degree afternoon spent at Walnut Creek Metropolitan Park, I was drenched in sweat and needed re-hydration.  The perfect excuse!  Walking in, your nose gets hit with a strong wave of coffee aroma.  Stronger than Starbucks in my opinion.  This place really advertises for itself.  I ordered the Wintermoon with soy as well as a cup of ice water.  They hype is real!  The Wintermoon is an iced latte with moon milk and it was absolutely delicious.  It's very sweet, but since the drink isn't thick like a frapp, the flavors aren't overwhelming.  I don't like the taste of hot coffee, but I'm a huge fan of coffee flavored anything, so this drink is essentially everything I love in a cup.  If you need me, I'm here on the Summer Moon fan train.

The barista told me an extra shot with the 20 oz was free so I opted for another shot. It was tasty, but a little sweeter than I like my coffee to be. Glad I got the extra shot or else it would've been even sweeter. I think they have an option to add less moon milk to reduce the sweetness. Gotta opt for that next time!  I went with two girlfriends from work and didn't have to wait long for our coffee. Awesome!  The second visit was only two days later. (This place is really close to work!)

Summermoon Coffee Bar ," 4/25/2016 Oh. Em. Gee. I think I finally found my favorite coffee shop. What is this moon milk medley that you have created?! I know it's a secret so I won't keep prying, but whatever this heavenly nectar is that you've concocted it's amazing. I saw on Yelp people rave reviewing about their summer moon latte so I had to try it. My bf and I snagged one each and I was totally blown away; it's sweet, creamy, and actually 'velvety,' if a latte could ever be compared to that of a fancy plush couch.  I could handle drinking a summer moon latte everyday, but the friendly and helpful barista said that the half moon latte is pretty popular for those that don't want so much sweetness.  The interior is cute and simple, it's going for a 'cool coffee shop' vibe but is actually cool about it. So cool in fact that every single seat was occupied but someone on their laptop... maybe some more tables are in order.  Go order a summer moon latte. ", pos 
Summermoon Coffee Bar ," 9/10/2016 I'm totally thrilled this place opened up.  Since I don't deal with ""mystery"" ingredients, I can't comment on their moon-milk type drinks, but they seem to be pretty popular. (My boyfriend thinks there's butterscotch in it, at least based on the hot chocolate.) Their Velvet black coffee or an almond milk latte are my usual orders, and both are excellent. In fact, given that almond milk latte is pretty much my ""test"" for a coffee shop, I think they're my #1 at the moment.  I like the decor a lot, and for me it's a convenient place to meet up with people. Parking is usually OK (I'd suggest parking more toward the LASIK-side for more spaces and less congestion). I also like that they have some gluten free food options. My favorite is the chicken pot (hand) pie.  My nits? The front door is freaking HEAVY! Also it's much too cold for my liking to actually work inside. So I usually stay outside and it's fine; there are only a few outdoor tables but I've never had a problem getting one. Sometimes if they are busy they are very slow getting orders done. It once took me 20 minutes to get my latte, but the dude realize this and delivered it to me outside! Also the hand pies are so good but they could be a bit bigger. :-) ", pos

Those who are short on time should try their Nitro coffee, which is on tap thus removing  the wait for them to make the expresso shots. The Nitro does, however, have a lot of caffeine so those who goes that route should be prepared for a caffeine rush.  In addition to coffee they also serve breakfast tacos, sandwiches, and baked goods from other local places. I am a big fan of the lemon poppy seed bread from Russell's Bakery.

Summermoon Coffee Bar ," 1/24/2016 2 check-ins I came and tried Summer Moon Coffee Bar because of the rave reviews.  They have quite a few coffee choices with explanations of what most are, which is nice when trying a new coffee house.  I also liked the overall feel of the coffee bar.  They have a variety of different types of seats from couches to tables for working with laptops, to a bar\counter area which is where we ended up sitting because I wanted to watch them make the coffee.  I ordered a half summer moon latte as I don't like my coffee super sweet.  I'm glad I ordered the half because even this was a bit on the sweet side for my taste, but it had a smooth taste.  My main complaint is the coffee itself tasted a bit watered down to me which added to why it tasted sweet.  So while sipping my coffee I watched as they made others drinks and the one thing I think they could improve upon is the tamping process.  They seem to be doing a good job checking the coarseness of the ground coffee bean as well as checking the time it takes to brew an ounce of espresso and adjusting accordingly, but watching the baristas tamp, it didn't look like they were applying enough pressure.  Typically tamping should be done with 45-50 pounds of pressure and it didn't look like this type of pressure was being applied.  This would explain the slight watered down espresso.  If the tamp is not applied with enough pressure it leaves air which allows the water to flow through the grounds without infusing as much coffee flavor.  It also causes more of a white foam on top of the shot of espresso which was very visible as I watched the espresso come out, as well as proof that the grounds are not getting tamped with enough pressure.  They had a scale right there on the counter and it would be nice to see them use that for newer baristas to measure the tamping pressure until they are experienced enough to know how much pressure to apply without it. Overall though, I enjoyed my trip here and when in the Domain area would definitely consider stopping in again for a cup of Joe. Yes!

How does that not spell ""AWESOME"" in every sense of the word?! If I have friends in town, this is where I am going to take them.  I always get a half Wintermoon latte or a Half Summermoon. The moon milk is nectar of the gods. The stuff is sweet so if you are NOT a sweet coffee person then you may want to order it as a plain latte and add your own sugar. The full Summer/Wintermoons are too sweet for me...and I'm a *3-4 packs of sugar* in my coffee kind of girl.  It's not everyone's cup of coffee to have it be sweet, rich, creamy, with caramel undertones with a slight hint of vanilla. Some people even drink it black. If I did, I'd probably still think their coffee is the bees knees. Good lattes come from good coffee still...after all.  But it sure is damn addictive if you like it. And thankfully, only being 5 miles away, that means I'll be here way more often.  Nice, clean, and functional layout. They've got a few tables and places for seating. I love that they have a neat wood based aesthetic around the bar area. The industrial pipe shelving? I totally want to steal it.  It's not a study sort of spot in my opinion because the chairs are mostly bar height with some that are the usual lower height...but they don't look super comfy for an hours long study session.

Summermoon Coffee Bar , 7/20/2016 1 check-in I would definitely recommend the half moon latte if you're not someone who is really into sweet flavors! It includes the specialty creamer mixed with skim milk to balance out the taste. Will definitely be coming back to try the rest of the things on the menu! The tables and chairs are very comfortable for people who want to study or work here and they have plenty of outlets as well as seating outside. Their music is also pretty easy going and not too distracting. My first half moon latte! , pos 
Summermoon Coffee Bar ," 10/31/2016 Cute, comfy and unique spot. You HAVE to try the moon milk in whatever you get! I tried the 007 first and it was delicious. They also have pastries, bottled drinks and tacos from Taco Deli. I came and did some work on a Saturday and got a great seat. Wasn't too noisy or distracting. The employees were very helpful since it was my first time and I had some questions. Now it's my go-to since it's right by my apartment! ", pos 
Summermoon Coffee Bar ," 6/26/2016 My new favorite cafe. I'm a lifelong Starbucks devotee but this place is great. Starbucks might be one of the only major food chains that I'm crazy about, but when it comes to local businesses, I've got a soft spot.  I've always despised cold coffee drinks (when I DO drink coffee)...until I tried the 007 and the Wintermoon. I've been to Summer Moon about 3 times now and I'm so in love.  Try the Lavender + Honey cookie. It's a combo like no other. ", pos 
Summermoon Coffee Bar ," 1/5/2016 3 check-ins No more questing down south for Summermoon! Not that it isn't worth the trek. But now it's not required! The Burnet location is open and I am in trouble.  The liquid ambrosia they imbue into their lattes, called ""moon milk"", is smooth as silk and completely addicting. It's so delicious and rich that I actually enjoy the Half Moon (half sweet) variation. My husband loves their vanilla chai latte. They also offer a variety of delectable breakfast tacos, pastries, and hand pies.  Do yourself a favor and stop by for a flavorful treat! Now Open on Burnet!

Summermoon Coffee Bar ," 7/17/2016 2 check-ins To the staff: smile every one in a while and see how it makes the customer feel, you'd be surprised by the simple jester. Other than that the coffee is as good as ever, especially with their super secret moon milk. I ordered my usual Summermoon latte and a 007, which is espresso shots with moon milk shaken, not stirred. It was yummy. This location didn't have the local SoAP products like the original location so the north location doesn't have that ""local"" feel to it - more like a impersonal franchise. I'll be back only because I don't venture to south Austin very much and because of their coffee products, but please crack a smile now and then and see how it perks up the place. ", neutral

Summermoon Coffee Bar ," 7/29/2016 I'm a really big fan of summer moon and it's famous ""moon milk.""  The drinks are delicious and it's arguably my favorite coffee in Austin in terms of taste.  Try the Mocha Moon Latte Iced, the Winter Moon, or my girlfriend's favorite, the 007.  All of these drinks do the trick and give you that delicious and much needed buzz in the morning.  If you're looking for beans, this is a great place too.  My work commonly uses Summer Moon's coffee to brew in the office and it is just as good as the artisan drinks.  With all plusses come with minuses as it pertains to Summer Moon.  While the coffee is absolutely delicious, I am constantly faced with a pretty significant line from the hours of 7-10 in the Domain location.  This is a result of popularity of course, but some level of disorganization.  It certainly seems like the company could use one extra helping hand during these hours instead of having barista's constantly running back and forth to the register to take orders.  If you're coming in early, be prepared to wait a good 10-15 for your drink.  Don't come in a rush.  Thanks Summer Moon.  Despite my small constructive criticism you and your employees rock!

Summermoon Coffee Bar , 7/26/2016 I had the half moon latte and my husband had this tropical ice tea thing and both were amazing!

Summermoon Coffee Bar ," 12/12/2015 So excited we have one in North Austin! Their coffee is amazing and I've missed it since I moved from South Austin 5 years ago. 1/2 moon will always be my favorite drink- iced or hot. The pastries are from Russell's, so you can't go wrong with anything there. The interior of this location is lovely. I'm sure it will be crazy packed in no time. Everyone working on opening morning was very kind and seemed excited to work there.

Summermoon Coffee Bar ," 9/12/2016 Wow!!!!! Amazing coffee!!!! I have recently moved to Austin, and after seeing summer moon on tv I knew I had to check it out. I was so surprised by how awesome it is. The moon milk is the best part providing a smooth sweet finish. The fire roasted beans also aid in the smooth finish and never taste burnt. The coffee shop is super cute, and their t-shirts and mugs are one of my favorite parts!! ", pos 
Summermoon Coffee Bar ," 5/26/2016 I've been here about 5 times.  Recently to work and buy beans.    When I check out a real coffee shop I always order an espresso or a macchiato. No sugar.

My cold brew is actually strong, my Tacodeli taco is as fresh as it can be, and the employees were very friendly.  Though I live closer to Epoch, this place won me over.

Summermoon Coffee Bar ," 6/30/2016 Northies rejoice! This part of town has been overrun with Starbucks for too long and I've been patiently waiting for a decent coffee shop to pop up. Thank goodness Summer Moon is here. Being pregnant I don't get to have coffee much, so when I do, it better be good. (I am actually writing this review as I plot my next visit.)  While they have a lot of the standard variations of coffee and espresso, their Moon Milk is what makes them extra special. Another reviewer said it's like crack and I have to agree. I am normally a bit of a purist with my coffee, drinking it either black or with just a little cream, but not here. The Winter Moon is my favorite summer treat.  Plus the aesthetic is nice, there is always parking and the baristas are friendly and very efficient so I have never waited long.  See you again soon Summer Moon! ", pos

Summermoon Coffee Bar ," 4/9/2016 1 check-in I think I've found my new study place for when I'm in town. I think I've also found my new favorite drink for when I want to treat myself.  The staff here are super friendly - the barista was quick to recommend anything with the moon milk and tell me about how the sweetness could be adjusted. I ended up ordering a quarter mocha moon latte, which was the perfect amount of sweetness and tasted so good that I promptly burned my tongue trying to take another sip. (Admittedly I've been craving a good mocha for a looooong time, but this really was amazing!)  There's also an ample amount of seating and lots of outlets. Even on a Saturday afternoon there were plenty of seats open with lots of people studying and people popping in and out for chats. They also have a nice selection of small bites for anyone who's feeling hungry. And also, the parking is a big plus. ", pos

Pumped about their cold brew on nitro (every other cold brew I've had on nitro pales in comparison) as well as their affagatos served with local Lick ice cream, with two vegan flavors!  So glad summermoon opened in north Austin and we will be customers for years to come. ", pos 
Monkey Nest Coffee ," 11/27/2016 Big fan of this place! Both the food and the coffee have been good every time I've been. Last time I was here, I ordered a basic dark roast and it was very rich in flavor. I love that they have a study area/room off to the side. I'm always able to be very productive in there because it is nice and quiet. They have comfy couches if you're just coming to read or hang out. The employees that work here are super friendly and helpful! They are accommodating of customer requests and are knowledgeable of the menu. The only issue I sometimes have with Monkey Nest  is that it can get really crowded. There have been a couple times I've had to leave because I couldn't find a spot.

Monkey Nest Coffee ," 9/21/2016 2 check-ins GET THE THAI TEA NOW!  I was driving around local coffee shops but they all closed and the other cafes that opened 24/7 were way too packed. Thankfully we were able to find a spot right against the window and it was the perfect seat!  First time coming here I got the Thai Tea and my boyfriend got an iced coffee with hazel nut syrup. The coffee was very delicious and had the perfect amount of syrup. THE THAI TEA THOUGH! I've never had thai tea that tasted as good as Monkey Nest Cafe's! Even at boba shops they don't have it this good. The tea and the milk ratio is perfect and the sweetness is on point! I definitely recommend getting this drink. It does not have any caffeine in it. Also get it in large because you will regret not having the most you can. The price range here is actually very reasonable. They also sell baked good, sandwhiches, pizzas, and other retail drinks.  One thing customers may not like about this place is how packed it is. they have a bunch of tables for students and others to come and study. However, it is always packed and so you kind of have to fight for a spot.  The second time i came here I got the Sea Salt Caramel Latte. It sounded really really good but unfortunately it was just ""alright."" It tasted just like milk and ice. Either there wasn't enough espresso or too much milk.  Overall the customer service is great here. The workers are super sweet. Try not to come here to study for finals or an important test. It'll be a little hard to focus with all the people around you and noise and the delicious food smell distracting you. :) salted caramel latte. taste like milk Ice coffee Large Thai Tea Large! please get it!

Monkey Nest Coffee ," 8/8/2016 2 check-ins I always passed this place up thinking it was just another coffee bar.  Then my friend played there one Saturday evening, Kat Hale and the Candied Yams, so I drove up to see her play.  Initially I thought I'll get coffee and listen to her play and that will be that.  There is so much more there than coffee and it is all SO yummy!  By the time I got up there I had not eaten dinner, so I ordered a Crab Bisque soup along with an incredibly delicious Bacon and Spinach Quiche.  It was not one of those situations you frequently find yourself in at some random coffee bar where there is only only flavor of quiche and there is only one left from that morning.  Nope, no, sir, not here!  They had options for quiche, sandwiches, pies, empanadas, coffees, pizza, etc.  I couldn't believe it.  To me it was like a coffee bar finally woke up and said, ""People are hungry and finger food won't cut it!  They need options!""  Yes, we do need options!  More than something the size of our dang hand that does not fill us up!  Well, Monkey Nest gives you options people!  Once I got my food I discovered there is plenty of space to sit and talk, or study.  There was quite a large group of us there to watch Kat and Kyle play and we all had a great time.  In fact, quite a few of us ended up staying well over an hour after they were done playing because we enjoyed the atmosphere and drinks/food enough to stay.  I may live South side, but next time I'm North, I'll be stopping by. Kat Hale and the Candied Yams Live music ", pos 
Monkey Nest Coffee ," 10/1/2016 2 check-ins Your standard cafe that also sells food and is good for studying or catching up with friend. If you come during peak time though, say, a Thursday night during finals week, the wifi can be extremely slow, I actually couldn't connect at all and had to use my friend's personal hotspot instead. So I probably won't come here to study.  With Starbucks drinks being the bottom line, the latte here is pretty average. That is, better than Starbucks but nothing special in comparison to the many other coffee shops in Austin.  Just your basic coffeehouse with good vibes, food that smells really good (but I have yet to try), and standard coffee drinks. Nothing more, nothing less. ", neutral 
Monkey Nest Coffee ," 9/23/2016 1 check-in I loved their monkeynest sandwich and thai tea. However they usually have live music playing and the place is crowded and it can get really hard to study. Food takes a while for it to come out, but their sandwiches are really good. I love their salsa and their thai tea has a bit of fruitiness and tangy without being overly too sweet.

Monkey Nest Coffee ," 10/25/2016 1 check-in I would have to say my favorite flavor of the iced coffee is the hazelnut one. It is way too tasty for my own good. I would like to drink one every day but unfortunately not from here. If I could I would. It's either Starbucks or me trying to find Austin's sense of coffee.  I think this needs to be an occasional treat for me, but if you are closer, then it should be a daily yum for you! If traffic is not so bad in Austin I would definitely come here more often. ", pos 
Monkey Nest Coffee ," 3/20/2016 2 check-ins Every time I'd be cruising down Burnet Rd. I'd see this place and say to myself ""I am gonna try this place out"" but I was always in a hurry or I already had my coffee fix for the day.  But this time I woke up and deprived myself of my usual cup of morning joe and said to myself ""Nah bro..today you're gonna wait for Monkey's Nest Coffee!""  So my friend and I went down there to check it out.  As soon as we walked in you could smell the fresh ground roasted coffee in the air.  I knew i was gonna be happy already!  My go to item to test a coffee shop out is their iced coffee.  While I was deciding what to drink I couldn't help but notice just how much stuff they offer besides beverages! Lots and lots of food items and plenty of stuff pre-packed to go.  But I settled for a banana nut espresso muffin to go with the coffee.  Now they say their coffee is organic..and personally I can't say I can taste a huge difference but I did love how the coffee came out.   They give it to you plain with the flavoring of your choice.  It's up to you to sweeten and dress it how you like.  Most other places do it for you, but I like how they give me the choice to do it.  If you're lazy you won't like this at all, lol!  The atmosphere is very chill with lots of nice interior decor and the people seemed really nice.  The staff was very happy to answer my questions regarding their menu and items.  I have to come back and try some of their food items.  They look absolutely mouth watering.  But for now, I will just enjoy the coffee...  Super smooth and delicious!  Stop by if you need a coffee or snack fix. Espresso shake. When you wanna cheat treat and be hyper to burn the calories!! I know that feel, breh! I'm about that coffee life too, mang!

It was impressive to see the staff act as a well-oiled machine.  I had the Italian Panini at lunch and it was perfect. The ciabatta was not too hard, the prosciutto was salty and slightly crisp, and the mozzarella was melted perfectly. It also came with a pickle and chip and salsa.

Monkey Nest Coffee ," 1/11/2016 1 check-in Listed in Places to study in ATX/HTX Monkey Nest was my second home during my thesis writing process and I honestly may not have finished my thesis without it. Their decision to go 24/7 last year totally revolutionized the Austin coffee scene, giving night owls a fourth option (in addition to Bennu, Epoch, and Buzz Mill) for places to set up base for long work nights. But Monkey Nest is much more than just an alternative to those places - it's a unique, reliable establishment with a lot to offer.  One of the qualities that sets Monkey Nest apart is their willingness to serve fresh food all night. While you may be limited to reheated pizza and stale muffins at other places, Monkey Nest will serve up fresh sandwiches and flatbread pizzas into the late hours of the night (or morning). Some sandwiches can be hit or mess, but certain options (like the Green Goddess) are especially great choices.  There's also a variety of prepared foods here that are quite nice. I was surprised (but happy) to see salads, house prepped oatmeals, and even a dolma platter available for sale. Of course, you also have your option of pastries and cakes (all of which are either made in-house or from local vendors), but having the option to get healthy snacks is a huge perk that I haven't seen in many other coffee shops.  There's a ton of seating inside, but Monkey Nest can get quite crowded during certain times of the year (think finals week for students). The wifi will drop off during the busiest times, but I've found it to be OK when I've needed it most. The parking lot is also basically endless, so it's never been a hassle to come here.  Lastly, the coffee is solid, reasonably priced, and effective. They have specialty coffee drinks that are definitely worth a try - I like the Spicy Monkey Mocha, Honey Luv Latte, and Monkey's Uncle. The Four Ton Gorilla is as advertised (four shots of espresso), so I would not recommend it if you are prone to heart attacks.  Thanks for being a part of my life, Monkey Nest! ", pos

Monkey Nest Coffee ," 12/12/2015 We were in the area and Googled ""coffee"" and found this spot. The latte flavors sounded delicious, but the 'Chocolate Chimp' and 'Nutty Irishman' left so very little to be desired. They tasted like plain lattes, and not very good plain lattes. Five bucks for a flavored latte that doesn't have a flavor...  I guess the 24/hour concept is pretty cool and convenient, probably won't be headed back any time soon. ", neutral 
Monkey Nest Coffee ," 7/12/2016 1 check-in Food: Monkey nest special on ciabatta was pretty good, I like that they had a variety of breads to choose from. The cashier recommended me the spicy monkey mocha since it is popular, but I thought it was too spicy for me. The sweetness was the right amount though.    Study friendly? They do have a lot of tables available but I thought the tables were too small and being able to sprawl my stuff around is high priority. The shop was well lit and also has plenty of outlets.  For Pokemon go players: At the risk of sounding like a dork, this place isn't a pokestop even though the monkey nest mural right next to it is (it is so close to being within the vicinity it's upsetting), so sadly I could not collect pokeballs while studying :( ", pos

Monkey Nest Coffee ," 9/26/2016 5 check-ins Opening 24/7, 7 days a week, Monkey Nest has got to be one of my favorite go to study spots for those late night cram sessions! Say goodbye to your local version of the Perry Casteñanda Library and hello to good vibes, roasty toasty smells, and ambient lighting. Coffee + Thai Tea are great, but I would not recommend any of the pastries. They taste fake and boxy and old. But you'll go bananas (heh) for the sandwiches! They are pretty good! But one time I ordered a drink w a monkey in it that looked pretty on the menu and when they brought it out it looked all scribally haha! Saturday nights are sorta loud though for studying because some groovy local bands come out to play! And music choice vary! From folky tunes to grandma swingy jazz (the grandmas were so cute btw LOL)! Btw they would really appreciate it if you be a good audience and clap/snap! Overall if you're looking for that perfectomundo ""late night coffee shop"" vibe like on Spotify, MN is your place to go! Let them have cake! Hot Thai Tea: cinnamon flavor will give your tastebuds that extra kick! ", pos 
Monkey Nest Coffee ," 10/8/2015 YAY! This place is 24/7 now? My top choice for any time studying.  This place does get loud from time to time but of the all day and night coffee shop options, this is the best and here is why, 1) location is off Burnet and super convenient. 2) parking is strightforward 3) great food, great coffee 4) plugs at most tables 5) clean comfortable decor 6) friendly staff.

Monkey Nest Coffee ," 10/24/2015 1 check-in I give this place 3.5 stars.  Came here on Friday to study. 1) coffee comes in those huge cute coffee mugs. - cute but not cool b/c it gets cold fast. If you're there to sit and study and marinate in knowledge.. better to ask for a to-go cup 2) the place is super loud. music going. some lady in the back (there's always that one lady) who can't conversate with an inside voice 3) monkey bread was delicious 4) stayed there so long we ordered lunch!!!  LUNCH: had the chicken salad sandwich - yum! menu says it is served warm, its not. b/c that's gross. obviously. lol. had it on the GF bun, it was better than expected with exception of one huge glaring detail. WE both ordered our meals with no onions. It had them on there anyway, long curvy strips, some chopped small bits. If I was allergic this would be a huge airway issue. but luckily I only just detest them with every fiber of my soul and picked them out  Unfortunately I had the RED ONION taste in my mouth now. ew.  Overall, I love that it's open 24/7. But it gets a star deducted for the onion. and .25 for being cold and kinda loud... ", neutral

Monkey Nest Coffee ," 5/15/2016 3 check-ins This is an amazing coffee place! When you pull up to the place it has a nice curb appeal. There is some monkey art is the parking area. We stopped here in the afternoon and surprisingly it was packed! There was a sign on the front door that said something about music not being played during finals week, so we guessed it was finals week. The store had many seating options, but few were available. Everyone seated by us were very quiet and I felt weird speaking in a low voice, so this seems to be a great study location. I am not a huge coffee person because it is never perfect, either too sweet or too much coffee aftertaste. I ordered a chocolate chimp and the first thing that caught my eye was the foam design. It was in the shape of a chimp. I didn't even know that was possible, perfect presentation. The taste was amazing as well, not too sweet and no bad coffee aftertaste. This is the greatest coffee I have ever had. Wish I lived closer, I would definitely be an avid coffee drinker. Monkeys uncle Chocolate chimp! ", pos 
Monkey Nest Coffee ," 12/1/2015 My Nutty Irishman latte was ok, but it felt like the hazelnut and irish cream canceled each other out.  It was good, but didn't rock my world like the Espresso Shake did!  The Espresso Shake was absolutely amazing.  Its the best frozen coffee drink I've ever tasted, and among the top milkshakes I've ever enjoyed.  I will come back just to have this!  Very strong and rich, perfect consistency, perfect temperature, not too sweet or syrupy.  If you know anyone who loves coffee ice cream, you need to bring them here to try this! ", pos

Tons of little tables and chairs (perfect for working or socializing), some couches (perfect for relaxing/chilling/reading), nice warm decor. The people working here are also amazingly friendly! They also have live music oftentimes, which is pretty neat. Definitely a great place to get some work done or meeting with friends. And they're open 24/7! ", pos 
Monkey Nest Coffee ," 5/28/2015 Updated review 1 check-in Welp, it's been 2 days and we've ordered 7 drinks. Lattes of varying flavors (lavender, irish cream, hazelnut+irish cream, 2 spiced brown sugars, and almond+coconut) and it seems like they taste pretty similar with the exception of lavender. However, ALL were delicious and I appreciate a good latte. Spiced brown sugar is an excellent choice :) We also got iced tropical green tea with lemonade - it tastes nothing like starbucks, but was very refreshing and enjoyable!  We also got food today and were VERY happy. We ordered the chicken mozzarella basil pesto pizza, and the grilled cheese with chips and salsa. The grilled cheese was $4.99 with feta and mozzarella and was incredible. It's hard to mess up a grilled cheese, but it's always nice to get one exceptionally good. The pizza was very filling and the chicken tasted fresh. We shared both and were not hungry at all after.  We were helped by a different round of baristas from yesterday (where are you, Josh?) but they were just as nice and helpful. They checked to make sure our large order was correct, which I appreciated. Food came out fast, and I can't imagine why people would complain about the wait time. I'd rather wait a few minutes for them to cook my food than unwrap something to stick in a sandwich press.  Overall, Monkey Nest makes me wish I was staying in Austin this summer. Great place.

Monkey Nest Coffee ," 3/2/2016 It's 24 hours, so it's that. Coffee is money. There's so many to choose from, I just chose the spicy monkey and the irish one. They're winners. Wheatgrass is more expensive than Juiceland; that's what I don't understand. I guess you're studying and desperate, a couple dollars don't matter. This is Austin. Be wild and free and hang out with Monkeys. I'll stop by when I have some work to do and my own insomni-maniacal secret study spot just ain't good enough. ", neutral

We also wanted tea. Luckily, Monkey Nest has both! We snagged some red velvet cake and a couple of teas. Everything was great and reasonably priced. Service was friendly. This is one of those places that I thought could have suffered from bad hipster service. Not the case here. I just wish there were more parking spots and more places to sit. ", pos

Good coffee + yummy pastries + plenty of seating = the perfect coffee shop  I've visited their location on 24th a few times but this was my first visit to their original location and wow! I can't believe I've never visited this place before. Parking is pretty convenient since they have their own lot. There are plenty of seats inside, with a good amount of outlets so you can find a lot of people working/studying here.  I always order the Iced Salted Caramel Latte when I visit. They have their drinks in 2 sizes (16 & 24oz.). I also tried their Monkey Muffin which was delicious! It had pecans, brown sugar, and cinnamon. My friend ordered a Chocolate Chip Latte & a Blueberry Muffin which I really liked as well! The staff were pretty friendly when I had questions about the pastries.  I would definitely re-visit to try their breakfast tacos and their other pastries. We stayed until almost 7 PM on a Monday and a band started playing so you can definitely come here to enjoy a little music as well for a perfect date night.

Monkey Nest Coffee ," 11/24/2015 1 check-in So, I set eyes on this location a while ago in addition to all the great reviews, I made it a point to bookmark it. Having idle time the other day, stopped in and ordered a Cafe Latte and one of the Apple Turnovers.  I was very disappointed in the coffee. It taste burned and far too acidic. The presentation was fantastic but the quality was on the low end. Its been a tough road comparing coffee in the states, as much of it seems to be a ""fad"" as opposed to good coffee. Although my visit to Red Horn Coffee House was a great experience. I guess if I'm ordering a flavored coffee from Monkey Nest, it might mask the low quality coffee enough to enjoy. The apple turnover however was really good. Plus one star....  The location was quite busy and packed with students and young adults. There is free WiFi which makes it a great location to camp for a bit.  Not sure i'll be back though...... ", neutral

Monkey Nest Coffee ," 10/20/2014 63 check-ins Listed in ""Nuptial Coffee Bliss!"" So I was thinking about doing a list of all the Starbucks in town, which means I would have to bat out a bunch of reviews on the Starbucks I haven't reviewed already, and suddenly that seemed like a lot of repetitive work. So let's talk about Monkey Nest instead.  And I'll make it quick: I'm a fan of Monkey Nest because I'm a fan of Monkey Nest. It's consistent, it's dependable, and I've always found a place to park and sit. Sometimes, that's all I need. And when I think about it, I've done coffee here with just about everyone I know in Austin, at one time or another, and that makes it a little more special to me. I can think of certain people right now, and Monkey Nest will invariably come to mind.    The straight coffee's always been okay, I know nothing about their Monkey latte or Monkey Chai, and they have a real kitchen making real food. I'm kind of fascinated with their giant bowl of boiled eggs and Monkey snacks in the counter display. Lots of cakes & stuff too. I'm pretty sure they also have live music certain nights, but don't quote me, because I'm mainly here in the daytime.  Monkey Nest is apparently doing well, they've just opened a new nest around UT, and I'm genuinely happy for their success. I know there are Monkey deals during Monkey Happy Hour, I just don't know what they are. But I do have a Monkey punch card. It occurs to me this review is a little all over the place, maybe like a bunch of monkeys, um, looking for a nest. Okay, we'll approach this philosophically: Austin is to Monkey Nest, what Life is to - oh, make up your own ending. I gonna go have a coffee moment. Yes, they have highchairs here. Handy for conversing with toddlers. If you're a regular here, they've rearranged the little fireplace/stage area. Disrupts my sense of stability... They make their own breakfast tacos here. The vegan doesn't suck. Central Market is hard to beat though. See all photos from Errol M. for Monkey Nest Coffee ", pos

Monkey Nest Coffee ," 12/3/2015 They have, by far, one of the best lattes in town. There's typically always a place to sit for studying and/or getting work done. The music is also very mellow and isn't distracting. I recommend their hazelnut latte. It's always mixed to perfection when I grab one. They have a great selection of foods here, as well. Hearty breakfast tacos and numerous breakfast pastries are the perfect start to anyone's day. ", pos 
Monkey Nest Coffee ," 3/2/2016 First time here, and I really enjoyed it. Comfortable and easy-going, like you would expect from a coffee shop. As I waited for my order, I couldn't help but to observe my surroundings. The decor and branding felt so classic-Austin (or at least the Austin/Burnet Road I fell in love with in the first place), versus some of the newer ""cool"" concepts that are just a bit too contrived.  Liked the variety of food and drink options on the menu. And though I came at regular hours, the 24-hour factor is great.  I ordered a regular cup of joe and the Green Friend smoothie with protein. Thought the smoothie was too sweet, like someone dumped Fun Dip in it, but maybe I just ordered wrong. It also took 10 minutes to get the smoothie, which seemed excessive considering I didn't have to wait in line to order and my coffee was given to me immediately.  If I lived closer, I'd probably frequent more often. ", pos

Monkey Nest Coffee ," 4/26/2016 While staying in Austin, my coffee shop of choice has been Monkey Nest, a close facsimile of Starbucks with more personality than the national chain. The apartment I'm renting is literally right behind it, so it's a sweet under one minute commute to get to ""work"". I've enjoyed many a work session here at one of their MANY tables or in one of the comfy chairs by the fireplace. There's even a back room and a quiet nook beside it where you can get away from the louder open room and the barista banter at the counter. Open 24 hours, this place has been busy no matter when I come, morning or afternoon (haven't been here at 2am yet though).

Luckily their parking extends to the back, I've never had a true problem being able to park, but I have also never been able to get a spot up front. The staff is very friendly and the drinks are delicious. I think what sets this shop apart from the rest for me is the Dolmas platter they have. Delicious and filling at under 5$, its something no other coffee shop has and I'm addicted. I usually get my coffee to-go or am able to sit outside during the cooler months. Inside is difficult to grab and even more difficult when you are with friends. All in all its a great place, but doesn't have me swinging in often. ", pos

This ideal coffee spot would need to have plenty of seating, plug points, and a friendly staff.  Monkey Nest Coffee certainly meets all of these needs.  Located on Burnett near the AMLI 5350, it's the perfect spot for us non downtown folk to grab an organic cup of joe (although I prefer the Persian iced tea) and have a tasty meal while we work.    Every time I have gone in, I've been greeted by a friendly member of the staff.  If the line is long, I know it won't be a long wait because they are super efficient here.  If I have to wait because they are all out of bacon/egg breakfast tacos (which are delicious!), they always apologize for making me wait.  ""Well worth it"", I say.  I really can't say enough good about this spot!  They even reward regular users with a punch card system; something I haven't seen around for a while.

Monkey Nest Coffee ," 1/15/2015 1 check-in This might just be the best coffee in Austin. It is certainly the coolest cafe I've ever been to. They have a full deli for fresh sandwiches served all day, a bakery that rivals places that bake for a living, live music performing weekly and artwork sold from local artists. What's not to like.  I'd highly recommend the Waka Jawaka coffee: black, iced, no sugar. This way you can understand just how good the product is without cream or sugar influencing your decision.  For pastry, please please please try the monkey muffin. It has honey, walnuts, maple syrup and God knows what else.  For the Austinite health freaks...do not fret. They have healthy breakfast options as well as gluten-free and vegan options.  And finally for sandwiches, the chicken pita wrap is all I've tried so far and as far as I'm concerned - that's all I need. It was perfect.

While waiting, I slurped down a very satisfying cold press iced coffee (toddy) and wife sipped on one of their wonderful tea options.  In fact, she was remorseful she didn't purchase any to go.  While the hip factor leans more towards the customers vs. the decor, which leans modern/eclectic-ish, it's still a top spot for all types to drink, study, work, whatever.  A fav and a fan. ", pos

It's that delicious espresso and that creamy milk that they use!  The baristas are friendly, knowledgeable, and fast.  Wifi, outlets, and tons of indoor and outdoor seating so it's a great place to get your work done.  They also have beer on tap!

Two Hands is a perfect addition to the area. They are great for a stop-in morning cup of joe, lunch coffee dates, casual beer, or late night espresso. On my Thursday night stop, they had an acoustic set which created the perfect ambience for a post Kung-Fu coffee. (and a truffle, who am I kidding)  Hopefully the barista with the strong southern accent stays around, because he called me ma'am and it was amazing.  You should definitely come here. They've designed their menu and space to maximize the potential for customers at all times during the day. Morning, afternoon or night you can find some reason to stop by Two Hands.

Apanas Coffee & Beer ," 4/6/2016 1 check-in Listed in Wi-Fi for Free, Hippies love it!, The Places I Go Out Coffee is in the name, and yes, Apanas (formerly ""Two Hands"") makes a fine array of fair-trade, sustainably grown/harvested caffeine-infused beverages, but I'm impressed with much more about this new spot in my part of town:  Beer. Delicious beer by (mostly) Texas craft brewers. On tap and by the bottle in a rotating selection of brands like South Austin, Founders, Real Ale, Adelbert's, Stone, Breckenridge, Deep Ellum, Odell, Left Hand. Served by a friendly, handsome, Southern gentleman who called me ""Ma'am"" in an alluring way that made me want to order another round. When I expressed curiosity about one of the selections, he immediately produced a sample glass. Swoon.  Wine, for my proper lady friends who don't want to drink delicious beer. There were a few decent choices in red and white, plus a prosecco for my bubbly-lovers.  Price point, not bad at all for the hoity-toity Domain. Coffee drinks range from $2.30 - $3.50, fresh juice blends are $7, beers range from $4-$7. Happy hour from 4-7p with $1 off drafts & wines by the glass :-)  Serving assorted convenience foods from local stars: pastries (by Quack's), breakfast tacos (by Tyson), and sandwiches & salads (by Fricano's).  Bright, modern decor, with tons of natural lighting and plenty of seating for dining, sipping, or even working. There are lots of electrical outlets and I spied quite a few laptops in service during my recent evening visit.  I love that I was able to come in here fresh off a run, a little sweaty & still in my active wear, yet I was welcomed warmly and received great service without anyone batting an eye. I'll be back, hopefully soon.  P.S.

Located in the newer section of the Domain, this place is a nice welcome addition to the area.  They offer the traditionally classic coffee menu with all the drinks you know and love(no frappaccinos here!)  They also have a nice beer selection as well, but with such wonderful coffee aroma in the air the last thing on my mind was beer lol!  I ordered their cappuccino and it was a home run.  Delicious and nutty.. perfectly roasted flavors and tasty frothy foam.  One of the best I've had here in Austin.  They guys behind the counter were really outgoing, energetic and friendly.  They were eager to let us sample some of the drip coffees they had.  I fell in love with their signature roast the most.  Finally my palette is starting to acquire a taste for coffee without all the syrups and creamers and garbage, so I am pretty stoked about buying from places like this.  They also offered the chance to try their beers but after drinking a cappuccino I don't think my stomach would have appreciated it lol!  This will definitely be a go to spot for me besides Red Horn and with great customer service interaction like this,  it's easy to why other locals love this place too.

Apanas Coffee & Beer ," 3/6/2016 2 check-ins Listed in ""Nuptial Coffee Bliss!"", Domainatrix This north Austin Domain complex just gets bigger & better. If I were young & foolish again or temporarily deluded by male menopause, I'd get a very cool dog and move here in a flash. In the meantime, Two Hands and $2.49 will get you a good cup of coffee.  If I were a resident I'd give this place five stars and move on. But since I'm not, I'll tell you parking around here can be a little tricky, and your best bet is one of the nearby parking garages. That's when a casual coffee moment becomes a semi-commitment for me, and unless I'm going to other places at the Domain, I'll have to think about it. This may not be an issue for you.  I was curious about this new Rock Rose district, because I thought everyone was talking about Round Rock. They're not. It's almost like they photoshopped the best & brightest parts of West 6th St. and moved it here, with lots of shiny people and very cool dogs. A great lure to the Domain.

The only thing I can think to improve is more outlets near the bar area, otherwise this coffee shop embodies everything I seek in a coffee shop.  The Goods: - dog friendly patio seating. - fresh juices from locally grown fruits & vegetables that is made to order. - bright open welcoming space optimal for working. - located near restaurants, bars and shops. - free parking garage. - open latish for a coffee shop. - they offer happy hour Monday-Friday from 4pm-7pm. $1 off drafts. Speaking of drafts they have a nice lineup of local taps and a selection of both red & white wine. - they serve mimosas with fresh juices (choice of orange or pineapple). - in addition to coffee prepared tons of ways they of course serve iced and hot teas. They also serve Topo Chico and baked goods from a locally owned Quacks bakery.

Apanas Coffee & Beer ," 3/15/2016 1 check-in Good playlist, nice ambience, friendly staff, scented bathroom, ample lighting, outlets, and seatings they've got seating outside on a cute patio, seating inside with comfy sofas, intimate tables, and tables that allow you to do work  This place is unreal. It's got the space that none of the other hipster coffee shops can afford, the friendly staff who do not intimidate, furnitures that are not only cute but also great to use (you know those hipster furnitures that hurt your butt and wobble and just never seem to have enough desk space? The ones that probably aren't meant for desk work? Yep. None of that)  The only downs are personal - they're out of my way (perhaps a plus for folks in north Austin) and the latte wasn't as strong as I'd like (though very smooth). Also, not sure if I'm just late to the game at 6pm but they don't seem to have an extensive pastry selection, which can work out to be a pro  alas, I will just have to make another visit to check! :3  I will definitely be back to give the rest of their drink menu a go while enjoying the lovely atmosphere (:  Parking tip- park in the rock rose garage!

Two Hands Coffee has something to offer at any time of the day.  Most days of the week they are open from around 7-10pm.  In the morning, it could be a fresh blended juice made in house.   Lunch, sandwiches and/or salad by Fricanos Deli with a coffee.  In the afternoon, tea by Mighty Leaf, with a pastry by Quack's.  After work, a local beer on tap or wine by the glass.  The seating area is spacious and bright.  They have a few outside tables to sit at as well.  The seating is comfortable, and with free wifi great for students or those working remotely (no password necessary).    This is the first coffee place that I am aware of in the domain area that specializes in pour overs and organic coffee beans from Nicaragua.  They have a partnership that pays local farmers fairly.  There are two different medium roast coffee beans you can choose from.  One is more fruity, and the other more chocolate and nutty in flavor (El Capitan).  Both are delightful and well done.  They blend the two for the espresso.  The green juice here is legit.  It is definitely heavy on the greens, and not sweetened, just like l like it.  They are working on getting some gluten free pastries, currently they offer a coconut macaroon that is wheat free. It was very filling, and good.  The staff are friendly and do their best to keep up with the orders.  They do also have drip coffee for those that like it the American way.

Apanas Coffee & Beer ," 2/21/2016 7 check-ins Listed in Domain Rock Rose Having walked by Two Hands several times over the last few weeks, we decided to give it a try.    The interior was very open and welcoming with dozens of patrons enjoying the Saturday morning. We had a Chai Latte, Cafe Americano, a pour over coffee, and two pastries.  The Chai was very well executed but lacked character in the chai tea blend used.  Most of the spices were muted with only clove as the dominant flavor.  It wasn't really our cup of tea.  The Americano and pour over were both good, bold, and flavorful.  The high quality of coffee used for both reflected in the final products.  The two pastries we tried were the blueberry scone and banana tea bread - both from Quacks bakery.  The scone was fresh, moist, buttery, and chock full of blueberries.  The banana bread had great flavor but seemed a bit on the dry side.    Overall, this establishment is a great addition to the Domain and the new Rock Rose area providing a nice place to relax and enjoy a good cup of coffee. Cafe Americano Chai Latte ", pos 
Apanas Coffee & Beer ," 1/17/2016 12 check-ins Listed in Austin Espresso Essentials I had to check out Two Hands as one of the first businesses to open in the Domain's Rock Rose district.  They offer a range of juices, coffee, wine, and beer on tap. I ordered a hot latte, and tried an iced vanilla latte as well. I enjoyed both - definitely one of the best iced vanilla lattes I have tasted! I did ask for my latte in a to-go cup because I like my coffee to stay hot and was not given one, but that's not a big deal.  The location is beautiful inside and out - I love the minimalist interior and the comfortable seating. It definitely would be an awesome place to study or get work done, and there are large windows for a bright atmosphere.  Interesting that the coffee was delivered to our table directly, rather than called out at the bar - I am wondering how this will work during busy hours but it definitely made an impression.  The owner approached us as we left to introduce himself and let us know he was thankful that we dropped by on opening day which was nice. I also read online that Two Hands reserves a percentage of what they spend on coffee to go straight back to the farmers - much respect!  I would come here again to support the business in the future. pastries by Quacks! pretty latte art! Quack's cinnamon roll! yummy See all photos from Hanna J. for Apanas Coffee & Beer ", pos

Apanas Coffee & Beer ," 7/4/2016 Listed in ATX Coffee Fix The ambience is a definite five stars--plenty of electrical outlets here as well as lots of natural lighting. The baristas are friendly, but I've noticed on more than one occasion that miscommunication, or lack thereof, seemed to be an issue here.  One time, I had made an order and waited 8-10 minutes (the person who had made an order before already received hers 5 minutes prior). I went up and asked about my order and the barista realized the person taking orders never gave her the slip for my order. In the end, the situation was rectified but this mistake was something worth noting especially since it was not busy that time of day.  On another visit, I had asked for an iced coffee (specifically requested a drip coffee with ice--I know, I'm weird), I noticed the charge not equaling what was on the menu. I had then asked the lady taking the order and she said she was going to charge me for a cold brew. Looking back at this situation, it would have been nice if she said this upfront rather than me having to ask.  In the end, Apanas, once known as Two Hands, is far from perfect. However, with these flaws, I'll still be returning for the nice atmosphere and decent coffee. ", neutral

A friend and I spent the afternoon here - both inside and outside, very comfortably, discussing life.  We both ordered iced lattes - and while we both thought they were decent, they seemed mildly bitter. Outside, they have plenty of tables to lounge in, cordoned off from the street by a small fence. Inside, they have a smattering of couches, tables, and lounging areas with a separated nook in the back with a few tables itself.  I like Apanas, and I'd definitely come back here.

I've only recently gotten into coffee and was excited to see a glass beaker style brewing setup, sort of like a chemex on their counter tops.  Two Hands Coffee uses top quality coffee that they source personally, they're very excited to talk to you about it!  The coffee prices are fair, they offer beer and wine, fresh pressed juice, and also baked goods from Quack's.  The coffee has rich, slightly acidic flavor, because they really give their coffee time to bloom with the method they're using and the smell in the air is intoxicating.  The caffeine menu is straightforward.  Only one size offered, but with many different creamer choices, including coconut, which I highly recommend if you like coconut flavor and want a nuttier sweetness added to your coffee without the sugar.  If you are persnickety about coffee and near the Domain, Two Hands could not be a better choice.  I rank them amongst my top 5 of Austin coffee shops. ", pos

The usual hipsters people on computers and baked goods that came from somewhere else. I don't want to hate but the espressos and lattes I get from the barista at Lexus for free are just as good and not cause it's free but genuinely because it's the same thing. I was expecting a lil bit more unique flavored coffee from all the hype or some variation of whatever the best coffee in Austin would taste like if that's even a thing. I think this is another super hype I don't go to Starbucks cause it's a chain hipster gathering spot with regular coffee.

I can't tell if I've just been ordering the wrong things. I've had everything from their espresso based drinks to their drip coffee to their teas and muffins. Baked goods are delicious and not made in house. Both their drip coffees were VERY sour - so sour that I thought it was the creamer. The lattes are unspectacular and not that kind of gorgeous smooth rich taste I would expect from a fancy place like this. There was that acidic aftertaste. Their teas just taste nondescript. I never finished mine. To top it all off, this place is pretty pricy.  Their decor looks nice but isn't exactly the most comfortable. I wasn't a huge fan of their patio chairs on the inside set up, as the chairs dug into my thighs. There are only plugs along the wall. Seats become scarce the moment the populous wakes up i.e. any time that's not 8am. All of which are things I would live with it they had better coffee.  I do love their music choice though!

Apanas Coffee & Beer ," 3/23/2016 1 check-in Well, okay, maybe this place deserves five stars. But I've only had one thing on the menu here, so I don't want to get ahead of myself.  I wish Two Hands Coffee was just a little bit closer because I pretty much love it here. The interior is beautiful, spacious, brightly lit, and provides a really welcoming atmosphere with good music softly playing in the background. Good amount of open seats near outlets on a Tuesday evening. The baristas were very friendly--I mean, I didn't talk to them much but sometimes you walk into a place, and you kinda get the wrong vibe, if you know what I mean? Not here. Not even close. And they bring out your drink to you, which is so nice.  They serve a variety of things in addition to coffee: beer, wine, juice, pastries, sandwiches. My classic to-go drink is an iced vanilla latte, which was great (a tad on the sweeter side). I'm looking forward to trying their other items because it's such a great place to study or even just to just grab a cup of coffee (or beer) with your friends.  Also, they have a really cute patio for those who want to bask in good weather.  My only complaint is that if it gets loud, it resonates kind of fast because everything bounces off the concrete floor and wooden panels. Maybe if there were more sound absorbing material somewhere?

Most of the tables are can seat 2-4 people. Bathroom was pretty clean, no complaints about anything.  The coffee was okay. Nothing crazy. Some of the other reviews have said that it was very sharp. I can't deny that point. The coffee is better than the stuff that you could make at home (for an average person, not a coffee connoisseur), however it's not anything I'd come back for.

Apanas Coffee & Beer ," 5/9/2016 My buddy and I have met here twice in the past week to grab coffee and talk. I love the atmosphere of this place! As most have mentioned there is plenty of natural lighting coming in through lots of big windows! There is plenty of seating inside and an outdoor area as well with tables and a wrap around bar that has bar stools. They offer a good selection of wine and beer, and of course coffee! I really enjoy their coffee and will continue to frequent this spot!  Today, we met Amil(spelling?), the owner! He is a very pleasant guy and had plenty to tell us about the coffee and where it comes from. Their espresso is smooth and flavorful and they make all the classic coffee drinks!  Love everything; the beverages, the atmosphere, the location, the design! ", pos

Besides the alcohol and the awesome space these guys really care about their coffee which makes me feel good about being a patron here. Luckily I live close by and can beat the lunch time crowd. I recommend coming before 11:30 am and you shouldn't have a problem finding a seat or waiting in line. But even during the lunch rush the line moves quickly and there are able bodied baristas behind the counter. , pos

Apanas Coffee & Beer ," 3/23/2016 1 check-in I've started coming here twice a week to study, and really like it. Chill vibe and the drinks are pretty good- a bit pricey for a student's budget, but ethical, so I can deal. I can see myself coming here for awhile! Definitely would recommend if you're in the area. Plan on parking in the garage about two blocks away, fyi. Great place to study. Good music good vibes, decent amount of plugs lol ", pos 
Apanas Coffee & Beer ," 3/16/2016 Went here for breakfast one Saturday morning about a week after it opened in Rock Rose.  Ordered a pour over and it tasted amazing.  Also ordered pastries, which were great - while not made in house, they bring them in daily from quacks (which is perfectly fine by me).  It was quiet and laid back, but definitely had a steady stream of traffic coming through the door.  I am definitely interested to go back during happy hour (or a more reasonable drinking hour) as they appear to have a nicely curated beer selection as well.  So happy there is a better alternative to Starbucks in the Domain now. ", pos 
Apanas Coffee & Beer ," 1/26/2016 Finally, a quality cup of coffee in North Austin (The Domain).  I had to either go downtown or to Houndstooth (Midtown) to get a decent cup of coffee in this city.    Great staff. Friendly.  Good prices.  Great vibe.  The owner sat and got to know me for 20 minutes while he was super busy.   Definitely a community place. ", pos 
Apanas Coffee & Beer ," 3/1/2016 When I first visited this coffee shop, I was thinking about making it my go-to study spot. Although it can get noisy, I thought I discovered the absolute perfect coffee shop in North Austin. I can still say that I do like the atmosphere, that their coffee is delicious, and that their staff is extremely friendly.  However, I don't think I'll be returning after tonight. My table was approached by a person (presumably the owner/manager) who announced to everyone in my area (but actually @ me) that in the future, he'd appreciate it if we (I) purchased something, even if it's small, since we're (I'm) using their Wi-Fi & taking up a table. Yes, I do see that those are very valid points, however, I have mixed feelings about them even being addressed (and particularly about the manner in which he approached it). So I'm now writing this review from my iPad while on my iPhone's personal hotspot lol.  In my opinion, I think customers help a business in very direct (purchasing a product) and indirect ways. On one hand, I hadn't been buying and probably wouldn't have bought a coffee or snack every time I studied here (which would have been pretty often since I was intent on being a regular). On the other hand, I was sold on everything about their coffee shop and raved to others about how great it is, that they should try it, etc.  So how many times can I go without purchasing before I have to buy again? Is there some sort of coffee shop etiquette I'm not aware of? (These are not sarcastic questions btw). I think tonight marked my 4th visit, and to be honest, I was thinking about buying a latte before I was approached.  Maybe I'm just used to waltzing into my local noisy Starbucks and studying there without purchasing something like *ever*... but I guess I'll be returning there to study from now on.  I may come back when I'm over this, but for now, I'll pass on Two Hands Coffee and I'll probably tell my friends to do the same.  (But if you go, do try their latte with hazelnut. It's delicious.)

Patio is seating is a plus. They also offer almond as well as soy milk to go with coffee (which tasted great). Impressed. I will be back! ", pos 
Apanas Coffee & Beer ," 8/17/2016 Apanas is definitely my go-to place. Coffee is always tasty, food is fresh, beer choices are eclectic and there are healthy options... Plus, everything is priced really well. The service, though, is why I keep coming back. Every single employee is pleasant and there's a guy named Chris that takes it upon himself to learn the names of customers. I truly believe that his laid back, friendly energy is what contributes to the chill environment and consistent flow of business I see every time I'm there. Oh, and the music is on-point EVERY time.

Apanas Coffee & Beer ," 3/12/2016 Wow THC fits right in with the Domain. It's a nice coffee shop in the middle of an otherwise bustling plaza.  Quick tip for parking - go to the garages on the sides of the plaza. I was dumb and spent way too much time than I'd care to admit looking for parking cause I'm too used to Austin's pay-till-you're-broke parking.  The coffee here is on point. I had one of their pourovers, which was extremely smooth, but NOT acidic. I've also heard wonderful things about their latte as well.  My only slight issue is that seating can get limited and lighting is a bit dimmer than I'd like (I'm a student, but the really rare breed that uses many textbooks still...), but it's not like I'm squinting to read.  Definitely check this place out, especially if you'll be in the area for other fun times in the Domain! ", pos 
Apanas Coffee & Beer ," 7/29/2016 I'm not a big fan of the Domain, but the Rock Rose section is ok and this coffee shop is pretty groovy, so I've been a number of times. The baristas have always been friendly and my drinks were good. ", pos 
Apanas Coffee & Beer ," 1/19/2016 1 check-in Located in the new phase 3 development of the Domain, this coffee shop is a great addition to the shopping center. The Rock Rose area has a different look and atmosphere than the rest of the Domain and Two Hands Coffee is a perfect fit. The ambiance is inviting and the staff is very friendly and helpful. On my first visit two of the staff members introduced themselves and made an effort to get to know me.  Not only is the coffee superb, but they also offer beer and juices. The juices are made on the spot using local fruit and vegetables.  This was the perfect place to get some work done as well. This may change if the place becomes more popular though. If the service and products remain as good as I experienced, there's no doubt that the business will continue to grow. ", pos 
Apanas Coffee & Beer ," 3/13/2016 Really good coffee. We got a cappuccino and a pour over and they were both excellent. Unlike many coffee places that merely go thru the motions, they seem to take great care at pulling their shots, resulting in delicious flavors instead of that burnt nastiness some places expect you to believe is norm. Their cappucino finished with lingering sweetness kind of like maple syrup.  The people were also very friendly. We bought a bag of their Los Pinos coffee beans on the way out. Too bad they didnt have their espresso blend available to purchase but we will just go back again for next time. ", pos 
Apanas Coffee & Beer ," 1/22/2016 This wonderful little place is a short walk from my job. I braved the cold and wind this morning and walked over and I'm so glad that I did. I love this place!! First, it is nestled in the growing avenue of Rock Rose and I'm so excited to see what else is coming. If the quality and ambiance of Two Hands is any example of what is coming then they are on point 100%.  I decided to order two items just to get a sample of their menu. I ordered a Mixed Greens Juice and a Chai Tea Latte. The Chai is delicious, just the right amount of spice, it was the perfect temperature and blows the socks off any I can remember. The Mixed Greens Juice is really good, really fresh and flavorful.  The prices are not too bad, the Chai was $4 and the Mixed Greens was $7. I noticed that they had a nice offering of salads and sandwiches on their menu. They also offer an assortment of baked goods. Their drinks menu has plenty to choose from and I am excited to keep trying it all out.  The best part for me was the service. The owner and the sweet lady at the counter were both welcoming, friendly and talkative. They made me feel like I wanted to stay and have a chat with them.  Anyone that chooses to go to the Starbucks a few streets over is out of their mind. This place has everything a coffee place could offer. The interior was inviting and well decorated. Nothing about Two Hands feels generic. It is a perfect addition and I can't wait to go back! ", pos 
Apanas Coffee & Beer , 1/22/2016 What can I say about two hands! It's so BEAUTIFUL. The attention to detail is so thoughtful and the quality of the product is outstanding! Talking with Aamil the owner is so fun he is kind and so knowledgable! He has a passion for his products and even gives back to some of the farmers! He has 6 tap handles of all craft beer and a list of fresh juices which is perfect for someone like me who doesn't love coffee as much as my Boyfriend does! They even have happy hour Monday-Friday -$1.00 draft beer... I'm in heaven! Keep up the great work Two Hands! We will be back :) Beautiful Latte! Owner Aamil. Paradise juice !! , pos 
Apanas Coffee & Beer ," 1/18/2016 10 check-ins The Domain in Austin offers a variety of stores to shop, places to eat, and things to do. However, the location does little to offer for coffee other than Starbucks, the Steeping Room and restaurant coffee. Until now  Two Hands Coffee is a coffee shop my girlfriend, who already posted a review that is probably more insightful and enjoyable to read, recommended to me (by that I mean forced to tag along). The shop sits on Rock Rose ave, a hidden road that will be filled with new stores in the Domain. At first glance upon the minimal yet appealing decor, I knew I was in for a treat.  I took my gf and two sisters to try this place out. We ordered two vanilla iced lattes, a special Juice (I forget the name but I remember the price of $7) and a hot latte for about $20, fairly priced! I noticed that their bakery options are from Quacks, which is a local bakery near me that I often enjoy a pie or two. Coffee was good and to everyone's liking, but most importantly the juice apparently made my sister feel healthier within 5 minutes of drinking it. Wow  The vast interior and high ceilings give an open, relaxed vibe to the shop. Order your drinks/food, get handed a number and find a relaxing seat next to their huge window or a nice table with friends and a few minutes later someone will come out and bring your order to you. First time I've experienced this in a coffee shop!  Upon leaving, the manager/owner (i'm not too sure) came up to greet and thank us for our visit! An extremely nice gesture that gave me the extra push to declare this neat coffee shop as my new go-to coffee shop outside of home! ", pos 
Apanas Coffee & Beer ," 6/21/2016 2 check-ins This is one of my new favorite go-to places in Austin for coffee. Previously known as Two Hands, Apanas is great for coffee and beer/wine drinkers. I especially like that they offer both options because I have a couple of friends that don't drink so this place caters to both of our moods :) They also have juices and pastries as well so it's more than just your typical coffee shop. The vibe is cool and the staff is superb! I've gone on both week nights and weekend nights and have always had a pleasant experience. Sometimes there is a musician playing live music which is always delightful. I highly recommend stopping here. Only downfall is that the close ""15 minute parking"" section isn't always open to the public, and the parking garages are kinda far from the shop itself. So if you plan to stop in ""quick"" to get coffee on-the-go, it may take you about 15 minutes just to find a parking spot and then walk there. Otherwise, I'm still happy to go back. I just need to be sure I have enough time alloted! ", pos

So as a coffee house it does what it's supposed to do !  As much as I wanted to i could not take away two stars (felt really mean to do that ) for two major faults (one because of the location and two, well.. )  1. Parking is a nightmare if you plan to come here during weekends. This Is because of the location,I understand so I did not take away the star. Haven't been here during weekdays so don't know how the situation is then.  2. INTERNET connection issues.. now a days coffee shops have become more of a working spots than just coffee drinking spot.. and it feels that their Internet just poops out if there are too many people in the spot.

Apanas Coffee & Beer ," 2/29/2016 I am their biggest fan of both the coffee and the juice. I'm talking about freshly made juice that lucky for me is heavy handed on the veggies instead of just being full of sugar.  Do yourself a favor and order yourself a Mighty Greens. Their coffee is just simply delicious. No bitterness ever. One day I will move past their caramel lattes to try something else like the excellent pour over coffee that everyone raves about, but for now I'm happy with my lattes. Aamil the owner is such a pro when it comes to hospitality.  You can tell he cares and you'll usually see him working his butt off and interacting with customers.  You won't find any cranky too cool for school baristas working here.  The staff is nothing short of amazing.  Everyone is really approachable and will offer suggestions.

The baristas have been very friendly both times I went.  Its in the Domain, which is one of my least favorite places in the world to go, but its in the new Rock Rose section of the Domain, which is a little more tolerable.  That said, its relatively close to my house....  Ive ordered pourovers both times and theyre ok. Their coffee isnt great, but its certainly above average and they have the best beans you can get north of 2222 (where you can get Wild Gift at Thunderbird).

Guess suburb population tends to appreciate yummy sugary coffee flavored milkshake way more than real coffee.  In Austin, Houndstooth was my favorite , but a bit far from mine and it's N. Lamar location does not have enough tables for work. I am so please to find Two Hands, and now I go there every weekend for work, even though it still takes me 15 minutes to get there.

Corona Coffee ," 8/31/2015 4 check-ins ROTD 1/24/2016 Ok, this is the most authentic, anti-corporate, true coffee shop I have ever been to.  Naimen is the owner/operator and the most knowledgeable person on coffee I have ever met.  If this isn't obvious in the craftsmanship he applies to his trade, then you aren't a true coffee fan. If you continue to visit and listen to his coffee conversations, you can't help but learn a ton.    Now for the coffee...I am a traditional coffee person.   I like my coffee black, no cream, no sugar; so yes, I am boring.   I find those that order their triple half-caff double Chia latte with cinnamon revolting people that talk more about themselves, the Kardashians, vaccinations and whatever other mindless nonsensical fad happens to be popular.  You can find these people at the green and white place happily displaying their latest technology as a status symbol, but I digress.    I was so impressed with Naiman's knowledge I threw caution to the wind and left my coffee experience in his hands.  He had no clue that I liked my coffee plain Jane with the only question being ""whole milk?"", to which I said ""yes.""   After the typical slam bang of the espresso machine I was presented with the non-descript white cup with the to-go lid in place.  I didn't care to take the lid off top to see what was inside as the first sip would tell me more than any visual.  As I take that first sip, he asks, ""So?""  My mind is now seriously confused.   I detected a bit of mocha but the strength of the espresso bean and the silky smooth sensation of real whole milk froth.   I ponder the fact that I like this; no, I REALLY like this.  My response is a guarded one of ""Café Mocha but there is something strange and delicious."" His response startled me.  Naimen revels to my shock and horror that I just had a ""BLACKBERRY LATTE!""  I think to myself, how can this be?  I am a normal blue collar coffee type!  I am not a one bite fruit guy.  I love my droid and my Linux and my old school punk and all things anti-latte, yet I somehow love this blend.   The elegance of the blackberry syrup made and espresso bean creating a slight hint of Mocha combined with the smoothness of whole milk is a testament to molecular gastronomy.  I have now come to the conclusion that as long as a craftsmen is true to their craft, I can respect that.  I can not only respect it, I can admire it.  Corona Café is a true rarity and certainly respects that art of coffee brewing and blending.   While the green and whites are painting by number, Naimen is a true artist.

He's like a mixologist with coffee. He was training a new barista when I arrived so I got the pleasure to hear him talk a bit about the chemistry of the decisions he was making while brewing.  Ordered the Blackberry Dark Mocha and holy crap, one of the best coffees I've had. Not too sweet with lots of flavor. Most coffee shops cover up the lack of complexity in their coffee drinks with more sugar, which I hate.  Wish I was living in Austin again to hit this place up every day. Come here and you won't be disappointed. ", pos 
Corona Coffee , 11/5/2016 1 check-in This guy knows his stuff. I love that they offer a wide variety of ad ins and the different types of milk (ie: almond milk etc.) I had the Apollo (blackberry orange dark chocolate mocha) Delicious! Husband had the cinnamon cappuccino which was also super yummy! Try this place out! Going back tomorrow , pos 
Corona Coffee ," 9/22/2016 I came here because of the good reviews on yelp. I'm always in the area and I'm starting to realize how overrated Starbucks can be. So I decided to give this little place a try. I was not disappointed. I was greeted as soon as I walked in. I already knew what I wanted, the orange dark chocolate mocha but still took a look in the menu to confirm the name of the drink. It's called JUPITER. It's pretty cool, the whole menu is based on planets and solar system. My drink was delicious!! I paid $5.50 for a medium size. The owner introduced himself and he seemed to really put a lot of attention and he made sure the drink was made to perfection. He told me, ""I hope you love it"" and went on to tell me how everything is made by him, the process of the orange syrup and all. I was defiantly impressed! I will defiantly be back!! ", pos 
Corona Coffee ," 11/30/2015 Listed in Lunch Austin!, Four Star+ Coffee I'm writing this as I sip on some kind of magic latte that Naiman created for me after I dragged my haggard behind into Corona for some caffeine. (Normally I get a chlorophyll and green tea latte with almond milk, but today called for some extra oomph. I was clearly not disappointed.) As he described it, it tastes exactly like gingerbread. I agree, but it's 800x better than any gingerbread I've ever had. He also said, ""It's sometimes just really nice to have the time to make something special for someone."" Can it get better than that? Can it?!  Some other bright spots about Corona: they make a lot of their own flavors from scratch (the blackberry syrup is fantastic, and so is the long-brewed cinnamon/clove tea). (Edit: I previously thought they roast their own beans...someone who doesn't work there told me that! See Naiman's comment below. Does not change my opinion.) I found out today that the condensed milk is handmade. A lot of the baked goods are as well. They serve sandwiches from Fricano's that are delicious.  I highly recommend Corona to literally anyone with tastebuds. Just go. ", pos 
Corona Coffee ," 7/12/2016 This is my new go-to coffee stop! Awesome cold brew with many choices for flavors (if you're into that like me.)

Dark chocolate mocha + blackberry flavored cold brew. Very fresh, flavorful, and not too sweet. ", pos

Corona Coffee ," 8/14/2016 I've been to a lot of coffee places all over the country, this one didn't wow me. When I waked in I was overwhelmed with the smell of cleaning supplies and incense or something to that effect. The ambience was kind of bland but the lady behind the counter was pleasant. Coffee was good but not amazing. I think the whole feel was a little lack luster and we got two mochas a large and a small for $11.00. Very nice person working but wouldn't go back. ", neutral

Corona Coffee ," 8/6/2016 1 check-in Don't judge a book by its cover. This place is located in a small strip mall in a run down area. When you walk it, complete 180. Fun, vibing place with an extremely friendly barista/owner. My wife and I went with the Blackberry Dark Mocha - drink was real smooth with no syrup bite which is huge for me. Subtle berry tons with creamy follow through. Highly recommend this place, it is worth a 10-15 min detour if you are located on the west side of town. ", pos

We came in on a Sunday around 1p for our first dose of caffeine and were not disappointed. The barista was a female with a calm, courteous, and just straight up 'good-people' demeanor: awesome! There was a short wait when we came in--no biggie! It's a smaller coffee shop with a single person on staff taking orders and making the drinks. The actual beverage I got was super tasty--I could still discern the flavor of the roasted espresso and it wasn't overwhelmed by the soy or syrup. ", pos

Corona Coffee ," 8/15/2015 After recently moving to Austin, I've been looking for a cafe that can replace my old one. The selection and quality of the coffee was very good. The overall vibe of the place is very hipster and the music selection helps create that ambiance.  My biggest complaint of this cafe, is that there wasn't much in the way of comfy seating. Was looking for a place to sit, read, and drink some coffee. All there was were your standard hard chairs and tables and one couch. However, the couch is just as uncomfortable.  Overall, the coffee and selection made up for the seating arrangement making this a good coffee shop to visit on your way to work! ", neutral 
Corona Coffee ," 5/31/2015 I just moved to the area and figured that I would take some visiting friends with me on my first trip to check this place out.  In short? We love this cafe.  It's intimate, not Starbucks-busy, and within walking distance. One friend ordered the house-developed green tea chai. The owner even took the time to describe the flavors with which he crafted this chai. (It's worth noting that the owner appeared to be pretty down-to-earth with no hint of pretentiousness, which is very welcome for an indie cafe!)  New favorite local coffee shop, hands-down. ", pos

Corona Coffee ," 3/27/2015 Love this place! Came here on my first day of my Austin trip, and will be coming back every day to get me going. I was warmly greeted and quickly became friendly with Naiman, Bridget, and Dabne. Absolutely feels like your friends' place, making you drinks!  That said, if you want to study/work, and not chat with people, you should probably bring headphones. Obviously I like the community and conversation.  I recommend the green tea chai latte, and one of their specialties, the Harvest Moon-- honey hazelnut latte. But all of their specialty drinks sound divine!  Food wise, they stock lots of yummy local muffins, sandwiches, burritos, etc. I loved their tomato-mozzarella sandwich, but I hear their breakfast tacos are rad. Gonna have to get one tomorrow.  If you're looking for good drinks, friends, and ambience, I can't recommend this place more! :) ", pos

Corona Coffee ," 5/14/2015 I have been to pretty much every locally owned coffee shop in Austin, and this one definitely exceeds my usual expectations by a long shot. All of their flavors and syrups are made by them, and they are really amazing flavors, like blackberry and lavender. I had the blackberry white mocha and my sister had the salted caramel latte/mocha (I forget which!). Both were really, really delicious. I like coffee drinks that don't have an overpowering taste of coffee, and are more flavorful than outright sweet. The drinks weren't just loaded with sugar, but carefully made to taste delicious and refreshing. I seriously cannot wait to go back. It's a tiny little place in a small shopping center, so parking could definitely be an issue, but there were tons of spot on the late weekday afternoon I went. Thanks to the barista for being so great as well!  Oh, and their muffins are really good. I'm not sure if they were homemade or vegan, but they tasted like they were both. Yum! Beware, they close at 5pm on weekdays. ", pos 
Corona Coffee ," 6/5/2014 7 check-ins Quaint locally owned coffee shop.  I never would have thought it was here but for randomly seeing it when my husband and I spontaneously decided to drive around the surrounding neighborhood about a month ago.  We wanted to check it out, but it was closed at the time.    I had an early morning meeting today and decided to stop by after.   The staff is super friendly and helpful.  I had the iced Luna, and it was perfection.  Also had some breakfast tacos which are from Tex Mex off of Manor.  I absolutely loved the black bean, egg, and cactus taco.  Will need to check them out with the hubby sometime.    I have been frequenting the Star Bucks off Barbara Jordan (Mueller Area) for sometime now, but with this place just a few blocks away from there, I think I found a new morning spot.  They were not too busy, so it was easy to find a table and there are plenty of outlets for you to charge your phones, laptops, and other devices. I definitely would recommend this place and encourage you to GO LOCAL. They close at 3, so Star Bucks may keep my loyalty in the evenings. See all photos from Renee D. for Corona Coffee ", pos

Corona Coffee ," 4/10/2015 I just discovered Corona Cafe and I wish I had found it sooner!  I live close by but discovered it by chance when traffic was particularly backed up and I hadn't taken the time to make coffee at home. It's tucked away on a side street off of Cameron Road in a nondescript row of businesses, perfect for the neighborhood.  The vibe is wonderful and everyone there is friendly! I talked to the barista and two costumers as my order was taken and felt genuinely welcomed. The shop has an authenticity about it that's refreshing.  I've only gotten their drip coffee (super affordable, flat $2 for a good sized cup) and a tasty almond poppyseed muffin, but both were worth the price. Based on other people's reviews I'd like to try some other drinks rather than my usual drip coffee. I will definitely be making more coffee pit stops here! ", pos

Corona Coffee ," 1/28/2015 1 check-in This is a cute little coffee shop just off Cameron Road close to The Nomad.  I'm a daily brew gal for the most part, and when I'm super fancy I go for an Americano--- no room for cream necessary.  In a pinch I will drink just about any coffee, but I typically stick to the good stuff.  I consider this place some of the good stuff. ", pos 
Corona Coffee ," 2/16/2015 3 check-ins Ok, so the first time I came here I just dropped in to grab a cup of coffee and something with espresso for my best friend's drive back home from Austin.  I wasn't really planning on being a fan of this place, but then we walked in, loved the vibe and both of us were almost immediately talked into trying the horchata with espresso (which, might I add, didn't take much convincing). The horchata is made in house with almond milk and is the bees knees. Ask for a sample!  Naiman (sp?), the owner, is awesome and makes tons of stuff in house from scratch - anything from syrups to horchata! They're the ""Corona"" items on the menu, you'll notice them for the creativity.  So, now that I've been a few times I can definitely say I'm hooked on two things: 1) Horchatte and 2) double brewed green tea w/ chlorophyll.  Try them. And all the other drinks because I'm sure they're great! Just wish they had better food options. ", pos 
Corona Coffee ," 12/30/2014 Dude. I can't even.  This place is really amazing. Atmosphere, Drinks (Best Cold Brew in town, hands down), Tacos, Staff. All A+++. Family owned and run, this neighborhood shop has got your favorite chain beat. Just try it once, you'll be amazed.  Atmosphere: It's hidden in a small strip mall, and if you blink you'll miss it. So, don't blink because its totally worth it. Inside is warm and cozy, and always has great music on. There is also a selection of local handmade hats, scarves and jewelry. Yeah, that's right. The noise level is usually pretty quite, with occasional crowds that make it get to the average level, but there always a few people working on their laptops so the noise level stays pretty low.  Drinks: So this is where they really shine and what ultimately drew me in as a regular. The cold brew here is stunning, and it takes a lot to impress me. I've driven all over this town and tried everyone's cold brew. Then I found Corona, and it changed my life. I know that sounds dramatic, and it is. But it's also true. Talking with the management about their approach to coffee, it becomes quite clear that they take this sh*t seriously! Their knowledge and skills are unparalleled. Other than the cold brew, they have a whole assortment of gourmet drinks. And I mean, Gour-freaking-met! The Pulsar (caramel mocha with himalayan salt) is my favorite. But the Corona Borealis (Kashmiri green tea chai latte topped with fresh saffron, cardamom and cinnamon) is my other favorite. Freaking Saffron!  Tacos: They carry Taco-Mex tacos. The migas is delicious, but the egg, cactus and black bean is also very popular. The spicy green salsa is creamy and delicious!  Staff: They are all so knowledgeable and friendly. This family establishment really cares about their customers and you will see it in the numerous regulars that come and go all day. I always have a great time when I come here. Which is about four times a week. Check it out. ", pos

Corona Coffee ," 11/1/2014 The vibe is so chill here, I'm thinking I'll bring my pillow next time and have a nap.  Good coffee, quality sandwiches. Not a huge menu, but they make what they got count. I've heard good things about their breakfast tacos, but they were sold out when I went. But hey, it was noon already, so that's on me.  The husband/wife owners have created a cool, little spot here in a not so cool strip mall. This corner is kinda beat down. But you get inside the cafe and all is warm and cozy. The husband works the counter and makes you feel like you just walked into your own kitchen and he's there to fix you something to eat and drink.  Cool-ass place! ", pos 
Corona Coffee ," 4/10/2012 13 check-ins Listed in ""Nuptial Coffee Bliss!"", ""These are my 'Coolest' reviews?"" Hmmm... Let me tell you what this place is not:  1.  It's not your mama's coffeehouse. 2.  It's not Breakfast at Tiffany's. 3.  If this is your hood, it could very well be the best part of waking up, without Folgers in your cup.  Second, you need to know the family that runs this place keeps it open from 7am to 3pm, Monday through Friday. And that's it. This is somewhat unique because:  A) They like spending their time doing family stuff together, rather than increasing business revenue. B)  It's a happy family. You'll know it when you chat with them. C)  I'm not sure how far the ""Family First"" concept flies these days at Wharton.  Yes, it probably gets backed up here during a typical morning rush, and they're always tweaking stuff like menu items and pre-packaged brown bag fare for you to carryout quickly. But if you do have a little time, consider stopping in here for a moment or two: I'm simply fascinated with people who run a business and do what they do because by gosh and golly, it's exactly what they want to do, and not just another job or something else in life to complain about.  I had originally planned to give Corona Café four-stars for being what they are - an unexpected gem of a coffeehouse hidden in a strip mall. That in itself makes them special. But it occurred to me, as I was hanging there on a Monday afternoon with an Americano and chatting about families and business and stuff, that this place might actually be an unexpected reality check, a brief respite for a ""stop and smell the roses"" moment. It was obviously more the scent of espresso than roses, of course, but I left there thinking, this just might be as good as it gets. ", pos 
Corona Coffee ," 1/19/2015 Friendly, funky place.  The Pulsar (caramel mocha) is outstanding.

Corona Coffee ," 5/20/2013 ROTD 8/18/2013 Corona is exactly the type of small neighborhood coffee shop that I am happy to support. The building is not the fanciest. You won't find granite fixtures and snooty leather chairs.  You will find a business owner who is absolutely passionate about coffee and taking care of customers. I thought I knew a fair bit about coffee until I talked the owner. I know nothing, Jon Snow.  That said, espresso is serious business to me. I am crippling my financial future, shorting my retirement, and eliminating a number of pricey private schools from my children's futures because of the amount of money I spend on espresso. Good espresso matters, and, when done well, it can be sublime.  I am heavily biased toward shops that use Cuvee beans (a local artisanal treasure and a shining example of what is right in the Austin food scene), so I was skeptical about Corona using different beans. I was very pleasantly surprised with the quality of the drinks at Corona. The beans from Trianon, turned into a delicious rich espresso. The drink was great and a nice change of pace from the Cuvee that I drink almost every day.  To folks in the Mueller / Capital Plaza area, you should be patronizing this shop. If you are getting your daily fix at Starbucks or, gag, McDonalds, then you are making a terrible mistake. Come out and support an underdog and get superior coffee in the process. It's a win win. I'll drink a double to that. ", pos

Corona Coffee ," 6/26/2013 12 check-ins A great little coffee shop and cafe located 20 feet from Nomad bar on Corona Dr. at Cameron Rd. Owner Naiman Rigby and his perpetually pleasant staff serve up quality cups of love and do it with a smile every time.  Come here for some really top notch java (roasted & purchased locally in the nghd). The espresso is bold and always pulled to precision. The hot drip coffee and cold brewed toddys have exceptional levels of flavor. Try them first without your milk preference - I promise you'll be surprised at how superior Naiman's offerings are to your typical cup of joe.  They also offer Horchata (yup), hand crafted Kashmir chai, refreshing fruit seltzers (""agua frescas"") and syrups - ALL are made in the store. Like I said, Corona is all about quality drinks.  Arrive hungry as well. There are soups made in store from mama's recipes, made to order sammies, fruit & yogurt parfaits, breakfast tacos and pressed paninis to name some choices. Always ask what the chef has prepared today.  If it sounds like walking into Corona Cafe will leave you spoiled for choices on good food and great drinks then you are correct. It's a nice problem to have and Naiman and his staff will happily deliver you to flavor satisfaction.  Come chat with a friend, get some laptop work done or pop in for a quick caffeine fix. Either way, break the chains and come patronize this local gem! Deli sandwiches. ", pos

Corona Coffee ," 7/23/2014 Naiman is the owner here, and he does a really good job of making you feel like family. I've been here twice now, and I feel completely comfortable dropping off my computer  on a big table and walking back outside to get even more equipment where I can set up my work station. I have taken full advantage of the free WIFI (better than at home, insanely, since I live in the neighborhood) and camaraderie.  For example, the first time I was here a mere two days ago, I met Marcus, who was working on a short film about bees... even though he knows zip about bees.  Then, the next time, I met Jeff... Jeff works at Nomad Bar.  He can SING! How do I know this? We sang together... at the coffee shop. Out loud. Naiman can sing too!!  We sang ""Rainbow Connection!""  All of us under its spell... we know that it's probably magic!!  Corona Cafe is magic. Like rainbows! Visit and check in to get 10% off. Or don't and pitch in to keep Naiman's dream alive!

Corona Coffee ," 4/11/2013 5 check-ins I had a short informal meeting here and I was super nervous, but the owner's friendly face was so relaxing during the ordering process that I ended up having a pleasant time! I really like the casual warm atmosphere with sturdy wood tables and they are spaced far enough for a little privacy.  I ordered the Waikiki sneaky- organic fair trade coffee with salted caramel and frothy milky foam. I wasn't tempted by their baked goods for some reason, but the coffee was delicious and a good price. I'm usually a late night coffeehouse goer, but since I am in the area every week I could definitely see this being my place for the occasional coffee fix. Great addition to the neighborhood and the family running it are a delight. ", pos 
Corona Coffee ," 4/11/2014 Yeah, I hear they have excellent coffee. But I can actually think of at least 3 really good reasons to go there that have nothing to do with coffee:  1) As someone who doesn't often drink caffeine, I really appreciate their awesome selection of non-caffeinated drinks. (A lot of cafes only serve the same old, boring mint and chamomile teas). They have something called the 'Supernova' which is lemon-lime echinacea (with, I think, blackberry syrup) that is one of the most delicious things I have ever tasted.  2) This is a family owned and run place, where everyone is super nice.  I really enjoy going here for the sweet, and down to earth folks who work there.  3) They have my favorite kind of breakfast tacos! (Its the kind with cactus and black bean and egg, if you really want to know). ", pos 
Corona Coffee ," 3/28/2015 Honestly I wanted to cry after coming here for the first time, in the best of ways. I really hate this word, but this place just feels so GENUINE. I ordered a chlorophyll latte which was so-so, and they have some tasty breakfast tacos, but the real pull is the people. I came here after dropping my brother off at the high school nearby, and realized that this is where all the teachers come before class to talk about how much they hate Greg Abbott, how the economy is fucked, and just in general talk about being liberal educators and how difficult saving the youth is. Highly recommended for people-listening and pretending to read your book. ", pos

Corona Coffee ," 4/7/2012 42 check-ins Listed in 78723: East Central, Coffee addicts, step up! It's sort of like walking into the Twilight Zone when you step in here. One minute, you're in the hood and the next minute you're inside a genie's bottle. I found myself here for the first time recently. And I've most definitely been back since my first visit. It sort of feels like you're walking into someone's home, and all their regular friends are there just hanging out and talking. I believe I was greeted by the owner, who was very nice and informed me of their offerings. I came in close to closing time (3PM) and ordered a large iced coffee, unsweetened and no room for cream (that's how I roll, black as night). It was delicious and I sat down for a bit trying to figure out what the wi-fi password was. Then I remembered I live 5 seconds away and there really was no need to find it out at that moment.  But really, I like this café a lot. It's in a strange shopping center right before you enter an older neighborhood. In fact, you can find it in the same place as Nomad. No problem parking here, there's also the lot in the back. Always somewhere to sit, since this place is kind of a secret. Friendly family that runs it, friendly customers, smack dab in the middle of the hood on the eastside? And I could totally walk, if you think it's safe. I'm in. ", pos

Corona Coffee ," 10/14/2014 Quaint, locally-owned coffee shop with great service and breakfast tacos. Oh, and coffee as well. With all the national chains nearby, it's nice to have this little place as an option nestled in Windsor Park. My only wish was that it was open a little earlier than 9 on the weekends. A must-stop if you're in the neighborhood! ", pos

Corona Coffee ," 12/7/2013 Listed in Coffee Shop Adventure Best new discovery!  I have heard about this place and driven by, but this is the first time I went inside.  What a GREAT vibe, super friendly barista, lots of seating.  They've taken a boring strip-center-esque place and added so much warmth and color inside.  (Wall art is by his mother-in-law!)  I told the owner off-handedly I was visiting my bucket-list of coffee shops this month.  He said to contact him directly if there was anything he could change or if my coffee wasn't ""perfect"" to me.  Man... that's skin in the game!  I guess you can say that if you really do deliver 5 star service!  I can't believe this is so close to my house and I am just being blessed w/ the discovery.  Will return as soon as my caffeine hangover wears off. ", pos 
Corona Coffee ," 1/28/2015 Great coffee and even better people!  Best cold-brew iced coffee in town. Sometimes they even have homemade almond milk (which I've never seen anywhere else), which they use to make horchata. Try a half iced-coffee, half horchata if it's available. Incredibly good.  This is a genuine neighborhood coffee shop that I am very happy to have near me. Small, friendly, unpretentious, laid-back, and family-owned by native Austinites. ", pos 
Corona Coffee ," 8/5/2014 I spotted Corona Cafe last year while taking my kiddo to school. I decided to wheel in one day, and I'm glad I did. Wonderful coffee, and great people behind the bar. (And it seems like a magnet for intriguing customers.)  A few other folks have commented on Naiman's passion for top-quality coffee. It's so true -- I think he's a teacher at heart, and he's always happy to use his encyclopedic knowledge of coffee to field any questions I've had.  Always a pleasure to stop by CC and get my day off to a good start. ", pos

Corona Coffee ," 6/4/2014 6 check-ins Quiet, small, community-oriented place with landscapes and portraits by local artists on the walls. I'm munching on a turkey-basil sammy from ""the greencart"". It's delicious but too tiny to justify the $6.75 price. This would be an excellent place to write an essay undisturbed. The music is at waiting room volume. They honored my 10 percent yelp check-in discount. There are only five other humans here, including staff. Bizarre, metallic stars of the prom-decor variety hang from the ceiling, lending a ""we put whatever up""/ absolute lack of pretense/ deeply casual kinda feel, which I profoundly appreciate. They're playing bluegrass and talking about who's playing where tonight. Three stars because it's relatively expensive, cappuccino tastes a little burnt. ", neutral 
Corona Coffee ," 6/8/2012 This place is exactly what a friendly neighborhood cafe should be.  I drive far out of my way to visit this coffee shop, and the owners always make me feel so welcome when I do. The family who owns this shop are the nicest and coolest people I've ever met, their awesome kids work here too and make the best drinks!  Everytime I have been here I have tried something new and have never been disappointed. Everything from the home-made muffins to the home-made sandwiches are delicious!  -Try the orange-cranberry muffin -The tomato-basil sandwich. Can't go wrong with chicken salad either. -Their iced coffee is the best! I also love the iced chai, or ask them to make you an Italian soda! -They even get cupcakes from a local baker on occasion and they are delicious!  As for the shop itself, I can only say nice things. It's so cozy, the wifi is super-fast considering the place is always filled with people using their laptops, and it's very clean. They always play great music (never too loud though, so I can still work, but enjoy it)  Unlike the other reviews, I don't mind in the slightest that they are closed on the weekends, because not only do they sell weekend coffee-provisions (brilliant) but I understand that spending time with family is important, these people work very hard and deserve that.  This place is my new home away from home.  Corona Cafe-can't top that! ", pos 
Corona Coffee ," 6/15/2012 This is a really cute little coffee shop in north Austin. As soon as you walk in you can tell it's lovingly run by the folks who own it, as it feels exactly as a coffee shop should: cozy, ""home made"" and with lots of interesting photos and artwork all over the place. The family that runs it was overly welcoming, chatting me up about this, that and the other and just making you feel like you're completely welcome to hang around. Seriously, they were some of the nicest people I have ever known. It feels like hanging out in your mom's kitchen.  Loved me some breakfast tacos (I hadn't been to Austin for awhile and forgot just how great those little wrapped up Mexican fingerfoods can be!) and the coffee was just perfect.  Can't wait to go back next time I'm in the city. ", pos 
Corona Coffee ," 4/24/2012 Updated review This place has improved tremendously since I was last here. The interior feels like you are inside someone's living room, which is very comforting.

Corona Coffee ," 3/15/2014 All-around positive vibes at this laid-back coffee shop w/ great food, juice and other options as well. Especially if you're staying in one of the depressing chain hotels near here, you owe it to yourself to spend your morning here. ", pos 
Corona Coffee ," 5/15/2012 I want to give this place five stars, but the fact that they're not open on weekends (or haven't been the last few times I've tried to go) and I work most of the week makes it difficult.  Coffee is from Texas Coffee Traders, and I love that. It's family owned, and even the high school? age kids know how to make a good latte.  Mom makes fresh 'box lunches' every day. So far I've had a fresh turkey sandwich with a small pile of yummy mixed nuts (no peanuts in sight), grapes and shortbread cookies dipped in dark chocolate, and homemade chicken salad sandwich (with apples!) with strawberries and crunchy Annie's grahams on the side. Perfect portions; I love that its not crappy kettle chips and a wobbly pickle thrown on the side.  Especially if you live in 78723, it's worth checking out. ", pos

Café Crème ," 12/4/2016 Wonderful. Do not be fooled by the business exterior, the interior of this coffee shop is warm and welcoming. Seating is nice but outlets are sparse so make sure you're fully charged if you plan on staying a while.  The coffee is very good, I got a caffe mocha and my friend got an iced coffee both were refreshing with minimal bitterness or acidity. The bagel breakfast sandwiches we got were delicious! We both got the ham, egg, cheese, and tomato sandwiches. Mine was on a rosemary bagel and his was on the Jalapeño cheddar. Both were delicious and filling.  They also have breakfast tacos and the option of having your sandwich on a croissant. For lunch they offer crepes. Along with some muffins and a few types of pastries they offer in the counter case.  All in all, definitely a new east Austin favorite. ", pos 
Café Crème ," 10/16/2016 1 check-in What a good find on the south side!  I'm never on the south side, so I'm sure I'm missing many great places. However, as I was driving down south to take my sister to the airport, we stopped off here to kill some time before her flight took off. We both ordered chai teas, and plugged in our laptops and enjoyed the ambiance for a while.  This place was super busy when we were there, despite having lots of tables/seating. The service was excellent, our drinks were great, and we enjoyed our time here.  Not that I'll ever be in the area again any time soon, but if I am, I'll gladly make another stop here! ", pos 
Café Crème ," 8/31/2016 I went in for brunch today to cafe creme . Ordered green tea matcha latte and the salmon crepe.  Was not expecting much from matcha latte but turns out it was delicious ! Would definitely recommend it. For the crepe, it was slightly Luke warm. Would have preferred it little hotter but tasted ok. It was quite filling.  There are lot of tables so good seating options. Didn't see many outlets though.  Would definitely come back again to try out some more of the items on their menu! ", pos 
Café Crème ," 11/20/2016 Ordered a 12oz coffee and a breakfast taco. Both reasonably priced and delicious. If you're considering the breakfast tacos, I wouldn't get more than 2 at a time, they're pretty big. Yoga cats! ", pos 
Café Crème ," 8/3/2016 When we found this place online we pictured something entirely different, not a bad thing by any means, but the logo and website don't really match the cafe itself. It's on the quirky side with funky music, strange art, and yoga cat table numbers.  The staff was incredibly friendly and offered suggestions while we tried to figure out what to order. Not because their menu is overwhelming... but because we're just very indecisive...  We opted for a dirty chai and a dirty green tea latte which led to me wishing I had ordered a bigger size because they were delicious. We also ordered a lox bagel and some sort of pesto/tomato/mozzarella/spinach thing. I really wanted a breakfast sandwich but this specific one was egg-free, so I had them put an egg on it. Don't do what I did. The sandwich was huge and had way too much going on. I ended up taking the egg off and enjoying it much more.  If we're in the neighborhood again I'd definitely stop in for another dirty green tea latte! ", pos 
Café Crème ," 6/8/2016 1 check-in Walked in not knowing what to expect. The atmosphere was a mix between India, Moby (the artist) and everything hipster with modern tables. The music was random it went from elevator style, club Ibiza to some acoustic song rambling on in a high pitched voice. The voice reminded me puberty changes for a boy making his journey into adulthood.  The coffee was fantastic. Sweet, dark and refreshing. The breakfast tacos where very filling and the two small cups of salsa was just enough for each taco. Coffee to kick start the late morning ", neutral 
Café Crème ," 8/24/2016 1 check-in Came here with friends on the weekend because they wanted to get some Crepes. It was actually pretty delicious. I was quite surprised. It's located in an office area or sorts. There is plenty of parking around the building. It's a walk up and order place and the food is brought out to the table. I got the Tuscany with chicken and my friends got the Saigon. It was very good though. The crepe was very filling. I felt that the Tuscany was folded much better and there was less empty space, whereas the Saigon had a lot of empty space with no filling. I enjoyed both and would come back for more though and recommend it to others as well! See all photos from Jennifer N. for Café Crème ", pos 
Café Crème , 7/3/2016 We got there at 8:04am. 4 minutes after they opened. The gentleman behind the counter was super nice and wasn't upset that we showed up right when they opened. I ordered a mocha frappe which was delicious and we ordered two crepes. We sat down and the coffee was brought to us promptly.  About 40 minutes had passed and no crepe. I went to check on them and the gentleman was surprised that we didn't receive them yet. Turns out the printer got disconnected... Not their fault.  The lady from the kitchen came out and apologized to us again and asked if we want anything else.. We asked if we could have a chocolate croissant. They brought us TWO chocolate croissants and fresh squeezed lemonade that we didn't even ask for. So kind of them!  Our crepes arrived shortly after that and was delicious.  I would recommend this place to everyone and be back. Food was good and the service was very good as well. :) Cool decor Yum See all photos from Saila I. for Café Crème , pos 
Café Crème ," 1/10/2016 1 check-in Love that there are plenty of seats and there's a lot of natural lighting inside. It's not super dark like at most coffeeshops I've been to.  Their iced caramel latte is OK....not near the best ones I've had. And it's pricier compared to other places. Size large ""for here"" is a standard Mason jar, and it's not worth the $5.14 I paid if we're talking just about size.  There are several menu items to choose from, not just pastries like at most coffeeshops. I think there's an outlet near or at every table and there's wifi (although it's not as fast as I would like it to be). I'd definitely come here to work remotely if I ever needed to. Iced caramel latte, nothing added or taken out, made wth three pumps of syrup and not enough for me.. ", pos

Café Crème ," 4/19/2016 4 check-ins I am so pleased any time my commute takes me past Café Crème. Their service is friendly and drinks are great. However, what really sets them apart are their crepes. Each time I try their salmon crepe I wonder why they aren't more common. I recommend giving them a try.  Their atmosphere is warm and friendly. The baristas are always welcoming and willing to chat if you're hanging around the counter. Like many local coffee shops, their walls feature local art - available to purchase if you like! This definitely adds to the local flavor.  If you are in the area, I recommend giving this coffee shop a shot. Pun intended. Don't forget your loyalty stamp card! ", pos 
Café Crème ," 10/12/2015 1 check-in This place is easy to miss if you are headed East on Oltorf. I ended up flipping a u-turn in the strip mall parking lot just past it in order to make my way over. Upon entering you are immediately greeted with local art, including cassette tape canvass portraits of Johnny Cash and Bob Marley. There is a bakery case filled with bagels, croissants, pastries, cookies and kolaches. The seating area is a combination of small tables with chairs, sofas and an oversized leather chair and ottoman that has seen better days but still looks pretty darned comfortable.  In addition to the bakery items, there offer breakfast tacos, oatmeal, hand made savory tarts, an assortment of sweet and savory crêpes, and salads. The service was friendly and fast. They provide you with a cat card on a stanchion (instead of a number) to put on your table and they bring the food and coffee to you.  I ordered an Americano with foam on top and the Versailles crêpe with Brie cheese, artichoke, mushroom, onion and spinach. And while I enjoyed my coffee and crêpe, I really loved my dining companion's crêpe madame more - which was a crêpe monsieur (smoked ham, swiss cheese, rosemary honey mustard) with an egg on top. Next time, I will order that for myself.  All in all, Café Crème provides a relaxing art-filled Austin ambiance w/ great coffee & delicious food. It's all about that foam Bakery case Forget taking a number, take a cat. See all photos from Darla A. for Café Crème ", pos

Café Crème ," 3/9/2016 1 check-in This is a good AM breakfast stop if you're working in South Austin - here's why:  1) Location: Near 35, this spot is perfect if you're traveling west on Oltorf before hopping on the highway to work.  The place is easy to miss - it's in a building that looks better suited for a dentist than a cafe.  Forget about making a left into this lot when heading east... there is a ton of oncoming traffic.  However, a plus for this location is it's easy parking.  2) Service: The service was on-point.  The staff were everything you'd expect from a small business.  Very efficient but also friendly.  3) Product: My coffee was delicious and my everything bagel with bacon and egg was good.  The bagel was a little dry, and the eggs could've had more seasoning.  I would recommend asking for a toasted and buttered bagel to improve the overall sandwich.  4) Work Space: There were two spaces with small tables.  There was also a conference space of sorts that could be reserved.  From the outside, it doesn't seem as big.  If I lived in this neighborhood, I would go all the time. Colorful assortment of baked goods Kambucha to go ", pos 
Café Crème ," 4/21/2016 Pretty good coffee shop!  Doesn't get a higher rating because of the atmosphere, vibe was just a little off.  The decor kind of puts me off, it feels a little too much like an elementary school classroom.  Breakfast crepe was basic but done well. ", neutral 
Café Crème ," 9/1/2016 1 check-in I had no idea this place existed until I took a shortcut on the way home and spotted it. I LOVE coffee shops, so I had to check it out. Their coffee is great. I drink mine black so a smooth, not burnt, coffee is always my hope and they did not disappoint. Also, they have breakfast tacos! And crepes! And it's all available until 3! Yay! I've never been to France, so I can't compare but I thought my crepe was very tasty. I'm excited to come back and try more. It's a little bit backwards in that they bring everything out to you without utensils or fixings and no one mentions where to find such items. (They're on a table by the front, that you've forgotten about by the time you order and sit down) But staff is very friendly and available guide you in the right direction.

I had the Nova Scotia crepe and, considering the pricing, I was shockingly surprised and satisfied.  I also order the cafe creme brulee and that also did not disappoint.  I don't know how they do it, but they managed to make the foam good lol.    There's plenty of seating here, but I wish they would place some plants around the tables to separate the tables from the parked cars.  Whenever I'm at Mozart's, I keep telling myself that I wished they had Cafe Creme's food/crepes/desserts.  Don't think that's going to happen though. ", pos 
Café Crème ," 11/2/2016 I don't know why anyone would rate this anything under five stars. This place is hands down my favorite coffee shop in Austin, with Fair Bean coming close second. The atmosphere is just so peaceful, and the baristas are by far the nicest people you will ever meet. Every time I come here, good quality coffee, crepes, kombucha on tap, and spectacular service, everything really is good here. Nothing pretentious or upscale about this coffee shop as opposed to all the other little places around town. If you're anything like me, appreciate good service and quality, go here before Starbucks. It's the same price if not cheaper and tastes 1000x better. Ps, the blonde barista with the blue eyes is the nicest one I have met so far, they are all nice!

Café Crème ," 2/15/2016 1 check-in Listed in 200 Review Self-Challenge, Coffee-holic One of the first days in Austin I wanted to check out a cafe/coffee house nearby to East Riverside - where I was staying. First off you should know that even though they have their own private parking lot not sure if there's a bike stand. I came via Uber and walked back to my Airbnb - note there are some sidewalks on roads and some without so pedestrian minded folks beware!! The decore is quint and colorful, a collection of nic-nacs surround the walls and bookshelf in the front room. The shop is quiet expansive and bathrooms are in the very back. There's plenty of seating between lounge chairs and couches to standard tables and chairs.  I ordered a Mediterranean/Tuscan crepe with a iced coffee. The crepe was warm and full of even parts tomato, cheese and meat. Tasted fine but nothing special. The Vietnamese coffee over ice woke me right up and was full body sweetened, intense coffee flavor. Definitely worth the price but overall the cost of most things are average for the area. Staff were nice and the atmosphere was comfy, soft music playing in the background. Overall nice place but nothing special. ", neutral

Café Crème ," 3/3/2016 1 check-in Came here with a friend who had visited (just earlier that week) and highly recommended this place. It was out of our way but heck, I'm always down for good coffee shops!  The baristas were friendly. The atmosphere was super chill and conducive to work, until 2 girls next to our table started chatting loudly about their lives, to which I'd rather not hear had I had that option.  My cappucino, however, was a Huge letdown.. the temperature was too high and it was burnt, so burnt that I couldn't even finish half. My friend's iced coffee, however, was pretty good.  This cafe also serves food, which means that if you stay there for long enough, you walk out smelling like food rather than coffee..  Alas, I'll probably give this place another try if a friend insists or if I live in the area, but not until then. ", neutral

I ordered the Nova Scotia because I love Lox and it reminded me of it and it did not disappoint. It was delicious and completely refreshing (especially for those hot summer days in Austin). On the other hand, the Saigon was the opposite in which it was an explosion of rich, savorful flavors. Still delicious.  The establishment gives off a studious college vibe. There are scattered tables perfect for diners/studiers of 1, 2, or a mild sized group. It was quiet when we went (around lunch time) with diners on their laptops, studying from their books, and sipping on their coffees. Besides crepes, the establishment also offers baked goods, which we have yet to try.  Warning: they stop serving crepes around a certain time (2 pm?). Check their website before you go if you are intent on some delicious crepes or otherwise you're setting yourself up for huge heartbreak. Nova Scotia (forefront) and Saigon crepes (back) ", pos 
Café Crème ," 9/15/2016 This is kind of mean but I hope this cafe doesn't ever get too popular - I Love the chill vibe, the lay out, the perfect size, the pastries and the Vietnamese coffee. I can really relax here, the music playlist is always so good and not generic, the baristas are straightforward and easygoing. I can always find a table and it's far away enough from campus to not be overloaded with students. I recommend the salted chocolate chip cookie and the Vietnamese coffee, but not at the same time :) sugar high for days! ", pos 
Café Crème ," 5/17/2015 2 check-ins Thoroughly enjoyed my visit yesterday. I ordered a dirty Chai and a bagel with egg and bacon on it. Dirty Chai was perfect -sweet, but not too sweet. Bagel was rosemary salt from Rockstar bagels, which is always a good choice. Bacon was cooked just the way I like it - crispy but not burned.  Atmosphere was nice. It's a small place, but they've done well with layout of tables and furniture. After eating,  we played chess. There are board games available on the shelves that you can play, and books too.  A few people were hanging out on their laptops and doing work, so you know the WiFi has to be pretty good. ", pos 
Café Crème ," 4/29/2016 I've visited Cafe Creme a handful of times, since I used to live nearby and now work close by. I love love LOVE their baked goods! Their iced black coffee is amazing and, as someone who is lactose-intolerant, this is a huge relief. The staff is usually super nice and friendly, and space is super nice and comfortable.  The only reason for a 4-star review is because of the ""hiccups"" I've hit when ordering something made hot/fresh. In the past, I put in an order for some breakfast sandwiches, only to be told that the chef wasn't yet in to do it. This was, admittedly, my fault since I pretty much came a few minutes after opening. I decided to give it another shot a few weeks later, and was disappointed by my egg and cheese breakfast croissant sandwich. The egg was burnt and the croissant was very stale. I'm not sure if I was just doubly-unlucky, but I'd like to think others would have a better experience with ordering cooked-to-order items from here.  Overall, Cafe Creme is worth the visit to grab some delicious pastries and fabulous coffee, but you may be taking a gamble on the cooked-to-order foods! ", pos 
Café Crème ," 7/31/2015 1 check-in This place is pretty unexpected as far as East (of I-35) Oltorf goes. It is a quaint little coffee shop, featuring a menu filled with fantastic flavors. I got the Snickers coffee drink (because it's Friday), and a white chocolate blonde brownie (because I'm an adult, and eat what I want). Both were fantastic.  The staff was helpful and courteous, and the atmosphere was quiet, with some people working on computers, and others socializing quietly, or reading books. They have a ""Leave a book, take a book"" book exchange library which is super Austin-y, and definitely something I look forward to taking advantage of with some old college textbooks I've been looking to put somewhere.  I'll certainly be back, and I'll bring enough money to buy them out of white chocolate blonde brownies. Don't forget to pick up a coffee drink stamp card for rewards! ", pos 
Café Crème ," 12/22/2015 We really are spoiled for choice when it comes to coffee places in austin. However, Cafe Creme stands out amongst the rest. While it perhaps isn't as ""hip"" as some other joints in Austin, their pastries are phenomenal (especially when they heat them up,) they pull great espresso shots using good coffee beans (I often find some of the artisan coffee beans that places in Austin use aren't that great because they're too oily or tangy tasting.)  The atmosphere is incredibly chill and relaxed. It's a great place to get a lot of work done with minimal distractions.    Having been to almost every coffee establishment in Austin, I can safely say that this is among the best. ", pos

Café Crème ," 11/20/2015 The coffee at Cafe Creme is tasty and fresh. Service is excellent and it's a big place with lots of room. That being said, the food is highly overpriced and mediocre. A croissant with egg and cheese will run you $7.50 (their menu says $6.50). It was completely smothered in greasy cheese. Nothing organic or local or fancy for that high dollar ticket. For two tacos, the sandwich and a couple coffees we spent $24. You can have a lovely sit down breakfast at other places in Austin for the same price as this place. This would be a good place to work as the dining room was almost empty, but I would skip the food. Half of a $7.50 croissant and a breakfast taco. Both were quite greasy and covered in cheese.

The best part about the staff is that they are open to criticism of the drinks and are actively working to make them better.  As far as the atmosphere goes, its very laid back with some background music so add to the ambience. The decoration primarily consists of artists' paintings on the walls which are for sale.

Café Crème ," 4/5/2014 13 check-ins Listed in Great Austin Coffee Houses The lowdown on this place is this:  the people who run it are bakers who own a catering business (they still do this) so this is why their cookies, pastries and kolaches are so great--they are baked in house fresh each day!  In addition to these homemade goodies they also sell other snacks like potato chips, chocolate covered raisins and pizza from East Side Pie.  They also serve bagels they get refrigerated in from Brooklyn, NY.  As for beverages:  their loose tea selection is pretty cool and they brew and sell Texas Coffee Traders coffee.

The kolaches were pretty tasty. Over all it is a great spot whether you want to just hang and enjoy some beverages or need to buckle down and get work down. Only wish it was open later.

Take a walk over to the corner of 6th and Congress- enter into the mezzanine at the Bank of America building on the corner- put the Starbucks to your back and enjoy a coffee by Sam. Make sure to provide an email address and earn your stars for that future cup. I guarantee you will be back. ", pos 
Brian’s Brew , 12/2/2016 Great little spot to get good coffee at low price..nice selection of coffee and tea.. , pos 
Brian’s Brew ," 10/4/2016 The reviews have been right. It is so hidden but such a good latte the Summermoon.  Definitely worth it,  it is hidden though past security (you can just walk past)  behind the elevator. Very friendly server! ", pos 
Brian’s Brew ," 9/7/2016 Friendly people, delicious coffee in a hole in the wall inside BofA building. The moon milk was a bit over the top for me but I can see that a touch of it can be a nice treat. That said the local Roaster ""Summer Moon"" makes an excellent, well-balanced medium roast that is now in my suitcase! Looking forward to the morning. Thanks and see you next time! ", pos 
Brian’s Brew ," 2/21/2016 Brian's is in the Bank of America building, past the elevators and on your left. I'm a tea drinker and they serve Mighty Leaf tea, which is my favorite brand! They were so super friendly here that I recommend visiting them based solely on that! ", pos

Brian’s Brew , 5/24/2016 just go. get the summermoon. still thinking about that latte. a little hard to find at first but just go past the elevators :) , pos 
Brian’s Brew ," 5/18/2016 Nice guy!! If you are looking for summermoon's moon milk, then this is the place to go downtown. ", pos 
Brian’s Brew ," 4/11/2016 Yes, yes, yes. The Wintermoon (iced summermoon) is the best latte I've ever had. I can't even-  I loved it so much that I seriously considered doubling back and getting another one in the same cup after I finished it (refill style). I've never felt that way about a coffee beverage before. I like that it's not like a big chain and it's in a very corporate-feeling building. It's kind of like a small act of resistance to shop local while surrounded by such huge businesses. Anyway- if I'm downtown, this is the place I'd want to go. Despite being a gold status Starbucks cardholder/addict?  Friendly but not in that overwhelmingly-perky way (which, let's be real, too much perk is tricky when I've had too little coffee on a Monday). I'd definitely come back and recommend to friends. I know one in particular who'd love a ""Cold slap in the face"". It's a drink, and definitely ask about it when you're there :) ", pos 
Brian’s Brew , 5/17/2016 Not what you expect to find when you walk into the Bank of America building...worth the strange walk past the elevators though to find great coffee and super friendly service. Both the hot and iced coffees are great. , pos 
Brian’s Brew ," 3/24/2016 Had the best latte of my life! That Summermoon is amazing. I typically like coffee and enjoy a good latte, but I LOVED this drink. ", pos 
Brian’s Brew ," 6/24/2015 Just a small takeaway coffee bar, but the wood fire roast they use is fantastically smooth. Standard preparations (drip, espresso). The barista was friendly and knowledgeable. Americano was delicious.  I'd go back any time, but not for the ambiance. ", pos 
Brian’s Brew ," 10/26/2013 1 check-in Located in the Bank of America in Dowtown Austin, in the back if the lobby.  Brian not only owns the place, he is there making and serving your drinks.  Brian is really nice and even had suggestions where to eat.  There is something familiar about chains, that no matter where you are, you know what us in the menu.  But I'd rather patronize small independent coffee shops like this in trips (or even in my hometown) because it is a chance to meet local people and give back to the community.  If I am ever back in Austin, for whatever reason, I will definitely come back. ", pos 
Brian’s Brew , 8/29/2015 1 check-in Amazeballs!!! The wintermoon is the bomb!! They make their own cream and it honestly tastes like heaven. The service was awesome! It's kind of in a weird spot. Right outside of jimmy John's in the Bank of America building past the elevators. , pos 
Brian’s Brew ," 6/24/2015 I love to use Yelp when I visit other cities and I found this place as a result of trying to find a local coffee shop near my work office. Turns out, this was a great place!  The breakfast tacos were on point (seriously get the bacon, so good!) and I had a delicious vanilla-spicy chai (Or as chombo as my fave place in seattle calls it). Guy behind the counter had never heard of this, but now he knows it's totally a thing.  Definitely recommend, I wish I liked coffee more. I was super tempted to order the Summermoon but...blech, coffee is not a flavor i like. LoL ", pos 
Brian’s Brew ," 11/11/2013 1 check-in As other reviews state, Brian is there making the coffee. Super nice guy executing a great idea...fire roasted coffee.  I just got a cup of drip to go, since there is no seating. Good equipment plus good beans yields good coffee. Not amazing coffee, but good coffee.  Probably return again this week. Give it a try. ", pos 
Brian’s Brew , 11/13/2015 Lived up to the ratings. Great coffee and great service! The cream and coffee combo in the summer moon latte was the perfect pick-me-up. It is worth the trip to the hidden location. , pos 
Brian’s Brew ," 8/2/2012 1 check-in Listed in Keep Austin Weird Wood fire roasted coffee?  Yeah, you definitely caught my attention.  It took me a little while to find this spot.  Fortunately, when you enter the Bank of America building on Congress there are helpful signs that direct you past the elevators and then to make a left.  There, sits Brian's proudly serving all the ticky -tackies (and they all look just the same)  I grabbed a double espresso and while I was disappointed that there was no demitasse, the product itself did not disappoint.  It was a smooth shot, reminiscent of an Italian espresso.  I think I actually got to speak with Brian or maybe he has a worker who looks just like the guy in the illustration.  He told me about how they choose a medium roast for their espresso and they feel the wood fire roasting is what develops the smoothness of the shot.  Clearly, they are also pulling it properly because as any coffee snob knows, even the greatest beans can be destroyed by poor technique.  The people who work in that building are very lucky to have such a dedicated purveyor on their first floor.  Of the coffee that I drank in Austin, this was some of the best. ", pos 
Brian’s Brew ," 8/22/2013 2 check-ins Brian is da man!  This small coffee dispensery is located inside the B of A building on Congress.  He(Brian) is an awesome guy to talk to and takes pride in his craft.  Their espresso beans are wood fire hand roasted locally and brew with an amazing crema layer....smooth.  I bring home a bag every visit to Austin.  I'm a fan of their half wintermoon which is Brian's concoction of milk with flavors.  It's between a white mocha and a latte so you still get the coffee flavor you deserve.  Good distribution of espresso between the three sizes.  12oz =1 shot, 16oz = 2 shots, 20oz = 3 shots. ", pos 
Brian’s Brew ," 7/16/2012 Updated review Brian messaged me through Yelp explaining the situation of his reason for closing. I still have yet to try the coffee here, but Brian seems like a stand up guy about his business!  I would suggest checking his Website/Facebook for updated hours (not yelp's) ", pos 
Brian’s Brew , 5/15/2012 1 check-in Girlfriend got the groupon here and so I tried the Mocha Moon Latte. I have to admit this place is definitely better than Starbucks. The Mocha flavor was strong and the cup was pretty sweet. Made perfectly that I didn't need to do anything else to it. Just the way I like it.  I didn't even notice that the logo was actually the guy behind the counter.. at least I hope it is. haha , pos 
Brian’s Brew ," 8/19/2013 My Summermoon latte was quite good, flavorwise...though it is just short of cloyingly sweet.  It had an excellent dark/smoky flavor as an aftertaste, which was quite delightful and made me really wish I'd gotten just a straight-up latte because if that aftertaste came from the beans I need to go back and get myself a bag of them.  I'm definitely a fan of this place because I like good coffee, but microfoam is the second best part of a latte and I didn't notice any.  Before I ordered, I asked what the Summermoon tasted like, and was told something like ""pure deliciousness"" or ""pure awesomeness"".  It's a bit of a hard sell...how often do you buy something to eat when the person making it cannot tell you what it tastes like.  When he said it was the top seller, I decided to take the plunge.  Then it took a few minutes to mix up the milk in the back room, and I was told ""sorry, need to make more unicorn tears"" or somesuch.  Finally I got to taste it, and darn if I can't place the taste anyway...I can't describe it to you, so I'm not much surprised that he didn't describe it to me.  So it's not in the easiest location to get to, the drink has indescribable flavor, it took a while to make my drink, and I missed my foam, but that coffee tasted gooood...does the rest really matter so much? ", pos 
Brian’s Brew ," 11/16/2011 So I just strolled into work this morning, got everyone's full attention, and asked if I can sing praises from a mountaintop about how g damn great my morning coffee tastes.  I was walking by the BofA building, as I do every morning, and mused about how much I love the Brian's Brew sidewalk sign out, as I do every morning - only this time I decided it was time to duck in & give it a try.  HOLY HOLY HOLY YAY.    ONE TASTE YA'LL and I'm sold.  Forget the other couple of places down the way - they aight.  But Brian's Brew takes the cake.  Hands down.  It's the best.  Rich, nutty, bold, smokey - DANG. ", pos 
Brian’s Brew ," 1/21/2012 Brian's Brew popped up on my radar recently, and I dropped by while running errands one morning. I had no idea it was tucked into a nook in the Bank of America Center. For those running around downtown, it is conveniently located in a busy area.  Who would not like a nice fire-roasted cup of Summermoon Coffee alongside some other baked goods--from Round Rock donuts, Rock Star, and Bakerman's? My coffee and 3 small breakfast staples ran me just $4.50.  For a locally owned coffee shop in a very corporate-driven building, check out BB. You will not be disappointed, and the guy really takes care of you here. Is his name Brian? Hopefully he can fight the good fight while charging so little for some quality selections. ", pos 
Brian’s Brew , 7/17/2013 This place is awesome! I've been going to Brian's Brew for about a year now and just sad that I no longer work downtown to get my summermoon latte! , pos 
Brian’s Brew ," 11/3/2013 Damn fine espresso. Crema was a little weak but it was served in a big cup. But the flavor... oh the flavor! Wood fired roasted, need I say more. Try it. Sip it. Savor it. Love it. ", pos 
Brian’s Brew ," 1/6/2012 It's the best coffee within walking distance of downtown offices, delivered swiftly by a polite staff.  It's not magical, but when something's the best at what it does, it should get five stars. ", pos 
Brian’s Brew , 7/16/2013 Had coffee from the self-self machine and wintermoon latte - both very good and above average coffee. Definitely will be coming back a lot. , pos 
Brian’s Brew ," 5/16/2013 I was going to get a Starbucks, but went to the ATM first... There, I saw the coffee shop sign and decided to get a latte there instead. Oh boy! That was the right decision. Brian was so nice and the Mocha Latte suuuper delicious... He told me it was the best mocha in town. He was right. ", pos 
Brian’s Brew , 12/19/2012 I love this hidden gem! The lattes here are amazing! Hot and cold. I come here as often as I can. It's nice to have a place that's not over-rated and commercialized like Starbucks. The Summermoon and Wintermoon lattes are to die for. , pos 
Brian’s Brew ," 12/5/2012 The mocha I had today was phenomenal. It's an office-based coffee service window, so don't expect a sit-down shop. Nonetheless, it is worth your time and effort. I didn't think that I would be able to distinguish the difference with the ""wood-fired"" roast. I was wrong. The mocha was the best ", pos 
Brian’s Brew ," 10/5/2011 Brian is the man.  He is congenial, polite, and skilled at his craft.  He is the kind of shop owner who remembers his regulars and the level of service is consistently rockstar.  The wood-fire coffee is rich, smoky, and roasted by an individual with an appreciation for the subtle complexity of coffee.  His prepared drinks are unique and delicious.  Try the summermoon latte and the espresso milkshake.  You can't go wrong with either.  Beyond the quality of his eponymous brew, Brian purveys the culinary highlights of Austin.  Round Rock Donuts, Torchy's Tacos, and Eastside Pies all in one place--no where else downtown can you find such variety.  Give Brian a shot, his shop is a hidden gem of what Austin is all about.

Brian’s Brew ," 1/24/2013 Yup. The reviews are spot on. This place lives up to the five star Yelp rating, fo' sho'. In need of some really good coffee, I walked over to this place to try it out. I wanted a Round Rock donut, too, I won't lie. Having those things a mere three blocks from my office is a dangerous thing...  I walked up and, other than a couple of guys who were just picking up their coffee to leave, there wasn't anyone in line. I ordered a 1/2 sweet Summermoon Latte and grabbed an oatmeal from the counter (totally forgot about the Round Rock donut... damn). The guy, who I assume was Brian, was friendly and worked quickly. The latte was delicious! So smooth, and even though it was the 1/2 sweet one, it was plenty sweet for me. I'm anxious to try the drip coffee, and I saw some coffee in mason jars... did I hear him say those were cold brewed? That might be good to take home to have on the weekends. Anyway, definitely try this place. You won't be disappointed. The building is caddie corner to Starbucks, so its not far out of the way if that's where you're headed. Plus, it kinda puts Starbucks to shame. ", pos

Legend Coffee ," 10/27/2016 1 check-in I really loved this place! Tucked right behind Franklin's, Legend Coffee Company is situated in a cozy trailer/truck house. When we were there, everything was ran by one person....I feel bad for not catching her name but she was a true magician, creating exceptional concoctions.  Even though it wasn't on the menu, I had heard wonderful things about The Queen Bee: espresso, honey, milk, and coconut oil. Never realized all of my favorite things could go together! Talk about a drink with multiple layers of flavor: slightly sweet, creamy, and a tad savory. Like woaaaaaaaa!  Quality coffee, amazing customer service, talented baristas...this is THE place to check out! I promise that you won't be disappointed and you are in for a treat! Specials listed The Queen Bee - espresso, milk, honey, and coconut oil ", pos 
Legend Coffee ," 10/9/2016 1 check-in If you are the kind of person who will get to Franklin Barbecue hours early, this little coffee stand will be a blessing to you.  It is very conveniently located behind this famous eating spot.  And even if you're not around for meat, the coffee is worth stopping all on it's own.  The deluxe mocha is lightly sweet almost like a hot chocolate which I personally liked.  The Cassandra (a honey cinnamon latte) is actually surprisingly nutty which I also enjoyed.  Also it helps that the people running the place are really nice. ", pos 
Legend Coffee ," 2/26/2016 1 check-in I can't get enough of all the food trucks in Austin. Each one has such personality - some are air streamers, some are buses, some look like little houses on wheels. The only thing they have in common is that they are on wheels and that they are uniquely decorated to the whim of the owner of the truck. I love that.  Legend Coffee, is no exception. Parked behind Franklin BBQ on an unpaved yard, is this tiny little house on wheels. It's made entirely of wooden slats, complete with a 3 tiered roof, and a tiny cut out window where the barista works gracefully as if this were her own home.  The people in Austin do not rush you. They let you take your time, examine all the different types of beverages they offer, before gently nudging you to order. There probably isn't a huge line in front of you and probably not a huge line behind you. And, if there is, people are quite chilled out about it. I think that affects how a beverage is made. Because the cortado that I ordered was one of the most delicious coffee drinks I've ever had.  The Queen Bee Cortado piqued my interest, an espresso with steamed milk, honey, and coconut oil. I've never had coconut oil in my coffee before, but let me tell you, it was delicious. It smelled better than any coffee I've ever had. Coffee with honey and milk you can probably imagine, but the full bodied finish of coconut oil in the end, that just give it a third texture, smell, and dimension that I didn't expect but ended up savoring. I highly recommend it and wish I had a cup right now. today's specials Legend Coffee's adorable food truck house longhorn ", pos 
Legend Coffee ," 7/3/2016 If I'm being honest, I would have to admit that I'm not a big coffee drinker...and when I do drink it it's typically Starbucks. Today, I though I decided to try something new and check out this coffee shop while waiting in line for some BBQ. I quite happy I did! My mocha deluxe was pretty awesome. It was made with sea salt and cinnamon but not too much. This has definitely made the wait for Franklin's much more bearable. The menu Mocha deluxe so good! ", pos 
Legend Coffee ," 12/2/2015 Love Legend coffee! It is delicious, fresh, and hand crafted. It is clear the team takes pride and joy in what they do. I really feel cared for and listened to when I go!

Legend coffee and the green belt= perfect Sunday ", pos 
Legend Coffee ," 2/27/2016 1 check-in Wow. I am so happy to have found this place (waiting for Franklins) i'm glad that I live just up the street.

Queen Bee Cortado ", pos 
Legend Coffee ," 3/7/2015 1 check-in Let's keep this short and sweet: these guys know coffee.  They are poised right behind Franklin's BBQ and serve some amazing tasting and really inexpensive coffee. They have fancy things like a cayenne cinnamon hot chocolate, different daily baked goods and bags of coffee beans, but the regular hand poured coffee was spectacular!  They use an Ethiopian roast that smells intoxicating, especially in the cold. Have it black, or visit the table a few steps away for cream and syrup (in a bourbon bottle, I like their style).  All in all, super highly recommended. I wish they were down in Miami, I'd drink this everyday! ", pos 
Legend Coffee ," 5/23/2016 I've walked my dogs past this place forever but always forget to bring $ with me--so glad I finally did. I'm not real big on hot coffee so I got their City Slicker--cold brew with vanilla and cream--and it was great! I'm now a repeat customer. Also got a scone once before the pastries ran out, and I look forward to more of those as well. Not too sweet either, which I like. I think they get a lot of business from the line at Franklin's, but it would be a great place to stop on your way to work, as there are places to park and you can dash in and out (but they don't open till 8am). ", pos 
Legend Coffee ," 2/9/2016 1 check-in Legend Coffee is convenient because it is right next to Franklin BBQ. It's actually a food truck not a coffee shop. Their coffee is subtle, not too sweet. I tried their Mucho Mint Mocha and their Cassandra. Both of them were warm drinks. Both of them were not too sweet and subtle. So if you like your drinks sweet, I would add some extra sugar. The Cassandra is a honey, cinnamon latte which was nice. They only have one size and they were about $5 each. They run out of food pretty quickly since a lot of people get to Franklin BBQ really early so if you're planning on grabbing a quick bite, I would stop by somewhere else on the way or walk to some nearby food trucks or coffee shops.

As I was already bouncing uncontrollably from the frigid temps, I swapped my usual morning latte for the Chai.  The spicy sweetness warmed me up and lifted my spirits to carry me through to the final destination of the Franklin cashier.    Even though we brought mimosas for our midday beverages, the ideal choice would have been to bring a bottle of bourbon to top off the available supply of warm milky beverages from Legend Coffee Co.  Next time! ", pos

Both delicious on the own, but the Cassandra is a cinnamon/honey flavor latte. I've never had that combination before in a coffee and was quite surprised how delicious it is.

Legend Coffee ," 1/23/2015 1 check-in waiting in line for Franklin BBQ in 35 degree weather isnt very fun, but when the kind folks at Franklin mentioned that Legend Coffee was open for business in the Franklin BBQ parking lot, i was all about getting a nice, hot drink haha. they have a good spot for anyone waiting in line for BBQ, but other than that it is hard to spot their trailer so hopefully the line foot traffic and word of mouth  is enough to keep them in business b/c their coffee is good!! i'm a sucker for a good pour over cup of coffee so that's exactly what i ordered. at $3, i thought it was really affordable too. Heck at starbucks their coffee is already $2 a cup so i'll pay that extra money for a freshly brewed cup haha. its pretty cool how they have an entire coffee shop set-up in a trailer - they have all the fancy equipment to make you a mocha, espresso, or latte if thats your drink of choice too. huge selection of tea for the non-coffee drinkers out there and they do offer a small selection of pastries if you need a snack while you wait. the service was super friendly as well. i hope that Legend Coffee does well!

Venezia Italian Gelato ," 10/21/2016 This place looks very unassuming on the outside but its a very nice, quaint transport to a world of awesomeness. It's definitely a place I can see an Austinite sitting down on any given day to work at a cafe.  The owners are really nice charming people, knowledgeable and passionate about their gelato, knowing how to appeal to the italian roots they're proud of in their gelato as well as tastes for the american palate.  That said, EVERYTHING I tried was off the charts amazing in flavor. Smooth, velvety gelato that's not too sweet, with fresh cream and fruit flavor (for the fruity ones). I think particularly noteworthy are the cannoli and stracciatella - the stracciatella as an all around favorite for our group and the cannoli has bold vibrant flavor. I personally liked the cherry as well - tasted sweet, like fresh picked fruit. Cream cake is also good if you're into that kinda thing. And though the cheesecake looks very fruity and you'd imagine denseness, its very light and comes off the palate with a very clean cheesecake flavor (the fruit compote type jam on top helps cut the richness I guess).  All in all, you can get a cup of happiness for not that much more than any other ice cream shop in town and you clearly can't go wrong, so come on by. ", pos 
Venezia Italian Gelato ," 11/19/2016 Mmmm the gelato is so tasty! I came here for a dessert date and had the Tequila flavor with lime and blackberries. It was very fresh and had a teeny tiny taste of tequila in it. I would love to come back and try some of the other flavors and baked goods.  The inside was very clean and stylish. Only downside was a small parking lot and lacking in outdoor seating. Also, it'd be nice to have more variety in coffee. Other than that I like this cute cafe! ", pos 
Venezia Italian Gelato ," 10/19/2016 If you're looking for a relaxing European coffee shop experience in the midst of a an increasingly boxy South Lamar--here is your oasis! This gorgeous little Italian cafe and gelato shop.  Operated by a delightful couple of folks (the gentleman can whistle like a Disney bluebird!), this place has coffee that tastes like you're on vacation and treats that are flaky and scrumptious. The ambiance is as balanced and sweet as the gelato. This place will chill you out and improve your afternoon. It's worth a little splurge for a Perfect 10 cafe! Cheesecake gelato and also a Coffee-type that was seriously so insanely DELICIOUSAAAAAA. Treats and Gelato ", pos 
Venezia Italian Gelato ," 8/31/2016 1 check-in Cute little shop run by a gorgeoussssss couple. I mainly came here to try their gelato donut on a stick aka the Mr. Ring! They ran out of the chocolate ones when I arrived with my family, so I was disappointed about that and the woman told me there was only one white chocolate left and the rest were either cotton candy or lime, which I dislike both flavors so I chose the white chocolate.  The Mr. Ring is not made with an actual donut. I've been wondering what was inside and how it tastes, but mine was filled with vanilla gelato on the interior with a hardened white chocolate exterior. This is great for Instagram photos and for the experience, but the taste of it was only decent. The gelato filling is kind of melted and frothy, which is understandable because it's more challenging to freeze the inside effectively. If anything, I would only repurchase this to try out the chocolate flavor. Otherwise, I'd stick to their regular gelato selections.  My mom and older brother both got gelato cups and every single flavor I tried was absolutely delicious! My all time love of my life here would be their Venezia, which is the very liquid, smooth and creamy, dark and rich chocolate fudge. It is sooooo goooood. Another winning option would be their cheesecake! Yumz. And my mom adored the peach gelato. Cappuccino is delish too. Just get everything. ;)  Service was super polite and sweet. The parking lot is really tiny and it's on a hella busy street. We got lucky there was one parking spot left, but good luck to those of you on the struggle bus! Don't give up! Or at least give up and come back later LOL. I really like it here. Next time, I'm having my eyes set on their coffee and more gelato cups. Display case. Beautiful gelato flavors! ", pos 
Venezia Italian Gelato ," 7/14/2016 1 check-in I don't know. There seems to be another gelato place here in south Austin popping up with a few more. I'm pretty sure we will see a season of Gelato Wars on TV or in the newspaper. I have to admit though I don't know what is good gelato or bad gelato. As long as it doesn't make me sick, I'm fine with it.  I see photos on yelp for gelato shaped like donuts. Immediately I must go and check them out. Luckily they had a banner which said GELATO out in front otherwise I would have been wandering up and down Lamar looking for this place. The parking lot is small and space is very limited. Once you get inside, it's a cute, modern cafe with one case full of the gelato donuts, cake and tiramisu. There's another case full of the gelato. You can ask for a sampling of the gelato and I had the cookies and cream with cappuccino. As a result, it was pretty good gelato. Strachelli and cappucino Tiramisu and donut shaped gelato ", pos 
Venezia Italian Gelato ," 12/3/2016 Great Gelato and friendly service. Dangerous that this place is almost within walking distance. My GF got the stracciatella and said it was just like the kind she used to get when living in Rome (she hasn't been able to find any like it since getting back to Texas). The gentleman that served us also mentioned that they will soon have fresh house made cannoli which are one or my guilty dessert pleasures, so we will definitely be back very soon. ", pos

Venezia Italian Gelato ," 8/13/2016 1 check-in Venezia Italian Gelato is run by an Italian couple. I had a moment to converse with the owner (the kind lady) and she was so sweet. She works practically all day--wakes up bright and early to make the gelato and service her customers.  I got the 2 scoops of gelato for $4, which isn't bad. I had the hazelnut and peach gelato. The peach was very peachy (duh, right?)--it didn't taste artificial or bland. It has a hint of sourness, but a great flavor for a hot summer day.  They only allow you to try 2 samples and ask that you keep your spoons for environment's sake, which I fully appreciate. Overall, I'll give this place 3 stars + 1 star for the lady's service. The decor was nice, definitely a great study spot. ", pos 
Venezia Italian Gelato ," 6/26/2016 1 check-in Ahhh gelato. Takes me back to summers in Germany, and traveling the canals of Venice. There is something so delicate about the flavors, compared to ice cream.  Venezia Gelato does not disappoint when it comes to bringing that delicacy from Europe. A small with 2 flavor choices is about $4.50, with a medium being 3 choices for .50 cents more. Quite the steal compared to other speciality ice cream in Austin.  However, I'm floored at the interior of the shop. Ultra modern, with everything in black and white. Large windows face Lamar, and Mom's Tattoos. It's very clean, and neat, with some relaxing music playing in the background.  Obviously a family affair, they greet more family who shows up in support. Out of the 3 flavors I tried, cappachino, pecan and hazelnut... The hazelnut was my favorite. Will be back to try new combos! My ice! Beautifully displayed Lovely selections ", pos 
Venezia Italian Gelato ," 11/13/2016 Ice cream donuts? Yes, it is true! They make donut shaped Gelato goodness and I am not sure what the outer coating is but I think just cream/sugar/yogurt and the inside is filled with gelato. We visited here the other night and my husband ordered THREE - he just could not stop eating them. I had a couple samples and ordered the vanilla and chocolate, so original I know, but they were good. I am used to the type of gelato that is more icy and not so creamy, but this is still good. ", pos 
Venezia Italian Gelato ," 6/2/2016 1 check-in I have definitely been on a gelato craze, so I was happy to discover a new spot sort of close to home! The parking lot is kind of small / hard to navigate through, so it would be best to try to go during non-peak hours or after the business next door is closed for the day! (they have about 3 or so spots reserved for that business).  The decor is absolutely beautiful! I loved the black and white theme, if I hadn't decided to stop using snapchat, I would have been snapchatting very inch of this shop. Even the gelato was beautiful! But let's move on to the flavors...  I ended up ordering a small with mint & apple cinnamon. The flavor choices I picked were probably not the best combination wise, but they were both so good, I couldn't resist. My partner ordered a small with cherry & passionfruit. I thought the coffee flavor was great, but I was so insistent on the apple cinnamon, I chose to forgo that since THAT flavor combination would've been even more weird! Overall, I thought each flavor I sampled was great, it was a matter of which flavor I wanted. The biggest thing I noticed about the gelato was how light/icey it was. I've seen to grown to like more creamy textures, so I was a little sad when it wasn't as creamy. However, I would come back & recommend others to check it out! Small mint & apple cinnamon, small cherry & passionfruit ", pos 
Venezia Italian Gelato ," 5/30/2016 Came with my friend 10 days after they opened.  First impressions: lots of seating, very beautiful decor.  Their gelato was pretty good. 4/5 stars because comparatively to other places in Austin, I wasn't blown away.  Their mint gelato was REALLY good, however. Exceptionally.  Because of their ample space, would be great for large groups of friends to hang and enjoy some gelato. Good selection ", pos 
Venezia Italian Gelato ," 8/15/2016 1 check-in My friends LOOOOOOVE this place. They come here once a week.  I thought it was very good & the owner looked very nice.  Cherry cheesecake was good-- looked amazing with graham crust crumbles on top. I thought it could use a little more cream cheese but that's just me. Passion fruit was really good-- tart & rich. The hazelnut chocolate is suuuuuuper rich and delicious but maybe too rich for most people.  This is a good, safe place to get gelato. They have flavors that are very typical for most Americans (""donuts"" ""vanilla"" ""coffee"" ""mint"" ""chocolate coconut"" and have a few exotic flavors ""passion fruit"" ", pos 
Venezia Italian Gelato ," 7/30/2016 There is a lot of hoopla about gelato places in Austin and I just haven't seen what all of the fuss is about. Most of them don't offer what I consider real gelato. Venezia is in a league far above the rest.  Nicola and Alice are not only awesome people (Nicola in particular also has a great handshake), but they're slinging some awesome gelato too and the clear best in Austin in my opinion. It's even as good as what I've had in Venice, Italy where they hail from. They have genuine passion for what their creating here that you can easily tell and taste.  I first came over a month ago and last came a week ago and see they are getting busier and busier which I love. I plan on coming much more. I'm a big fan of their espresso too. There is now real gelato in Austin to enjoy! Ben fatto!! ", pos 
Venezia Italian Gelato ," 9/27/2016 Simply awesome. This is the place for gelato. When I was in Austin I was a regular here. Neat and clean decor, very nice people and the mix 2,3 scoops options are really good. All gelatos are made from scratch and u can feel the freshness in the flavor. We had capuchhinos as well. Everything is just perfect. ", pos 
Venezia Italian Gelato , 11/20/2016 1 check-in Omg this place is so awesome and the gelato is DELISH!!! I have a dairy and gluten allergy and had me covered! The gelatin was definitely the BEST in town. Super fluffy and smooth! I Highly Recommend this place! The owner is from Italy too! He knows his stuff. From Italian to Italian this is the BEST place for gelato in Austin! , pos 
Venezia Italian Gelato ," 8/7/2016 Ooh talk about authenticity! The Italian couple who opened this moved from their home about a year or so ago. Love the store layout and the gelato (please do not call it icecream) is so pleasing to the eye! They also have vegan flavors. Got the dark chocolate along with raspberry - both were vegan (I'm not vegan but it works in my favour since I'm mildly lactose intolerant) but man oh man, you cannot tell it apart from dairy ones. This has to be THE best dark chocolate gelato (or uh, ice cream) I've ever had in the world.  Owner and the employee are very friendly and nice to talk to as well. Going to keep coming back for it! What a yummy display. Sadly we didn't have tummy space for this. ", pos 
Venezia Italian Gelato ," 7/22/2016 After a lousy day, I wanted to bring my wife here as a little treat.  I'd read the great reviews and was hopeful they'd have some great gelato, and we weren't disappointed.   We tried a few samples of flavors including cheesecake and passionfruit and everything was tasty.   In the end we both went with pistachio and cherry which was made with a tart Italian cherry and was absolutely delicious.  The pistachio was nicely rich and nutty with real pistachios and not the fake green dyed atrocity you find at a lot of places.  I got a macchiato to go along with the gelatos and it was rich, roasty, and really went well with the gelato.  The owners were both very friendly and I wish them lots of success here.  We at least will definitely be back! ", pos 
Venezia Italian Gelato ," 7/6/2016 1 check-in Listed in 100 in 2016 It's such a pleasure stumbling upon delightful little local places! Venezia was one of those stumbles.  Decent parking for it's S. Lamar location and spectacularly clean on the inside, I had high hopes from the moment I walked in. The woman at the front greeted me with a huge smile immediately and made me feel welcomed and wanted. She patiently waited as I decided what to order. Great customer service! Venezia serves up various flavors of handmade gelato and coffee. I stuck with the Gelato this time around, but would love to try their coffee too.  A small gelato gets you two decent sized scoops for  $4. The best part is that you can choose two different flavors, even with a small order. I ordered the cheesecake flavor and the chocolate biscuit flavor. Both were amazing! The gelato was perfectly creamy and each flavor was strong and distinct. I also tried the pistachio and the mint chocolate chip which were equally amazing.  I recommend coming here for a tasty pick-me-up. You won't be disappointed by the exceptional customer service or the amazing gelato! ", pos 
Venezia Italian Gelato ," 7/14/2016 1 check-in Yummy yummy Gelato!!!!!  We drive through S. Lamar quite a bit and every time we pass this place I always say ""I want to go there."" Well we finally got the chance to and our experience was amazing!  We both have had gelato before. L.C. had it in Italy and myself in Hawaii (lol lame, I know). But the owner of the place is so so so sweet, and so welcoming. Educating us about gelato, the flavors, and how he makes them daily. We love to see people passionate about their businesses. Especially L.C. he loves conversation!  A tip: you can taste 2 different flavors at one time to see if they combine well! We got a kick out of that.  The sizes are small (2), medium (3), large (4), and they refer to how many scoops you desire. We both got mediums. They are open late too so perfect for after dinner! The flavors we liked were chocolate coconut, pistachio, cappuccino, black biscuit (Oreo), hazelnut, & mint. ", pos 
Venezia Italian Gelato ," 8/9/2016 nice sweet treat. a little pricey 4 dollars for 2 scoop of ice-cream on the cone, but they are organic ice-cream, clean and no chemical which is a plus..  I love hazelnut favor. yum.... ", pos 
Venezia Italian Gelato ," 7/10/2016 My friends told me this was _the best_ and they weren't lying! This is my new favorite dairy treat spot in the entire city.  Venezia is a welcome addition. I'm a sugar snob, and I take my ice cream products seriously. I've had gelato everywhere from Rome to Richardson, and this is by far the best. Creamy and delicate, every bite was amazing. The flavors were the typical gelato flavors (hazelnut, pistachio,) with some extras thrown in (cookies and cream, strawberry cheesecake) and three vegan flavors for about 12 to 15 flavors to choose from.  I couldn't decide and had strawberry cheesecake and cherry. Both were rich and tasted so FRESH. It was like they had made it right in front of me (they didn't, but you could have fooled me). The service was super-friendly as well.  I highly recommend this place; just be sure to leave me a parking spot. ", pos 
Venezia Italian Gelato , 6/29/2016 1 check-in I have been DROOLING over the photos of the Mr. Ring for a few days now. I FINALLY got to try their gelato and Mr. Ring...  OH. MY. GOSH. It was delicious. I finished my Mr. Ring before I even left the parking lot! I love gelato and I love chocolate covered anything...so this is the perfect marriage of my 2 favorite things.  I sampled some of their gelatos and they were so delicious! The pineapple gelato is dairy free and tastes like I'm eating a pineapple! YAS.  What's even more awesome about this place is that their gelato is non-GMO and artificial color free! WOO HOO. I'm a total convert. I'll be walking over here so I can eat one Mr. Ring there and eat one on my walk home. , pos 
Venezia Italian Gelato ," 12/4/2016 Awesome addition to the growing South Lamar food scene and a great dessert or decadent snack option. Authentic gelato with creative and sophisticated flavors with the added bonus of luscious Italian pastries and exquisite coffee.  Even a modest selection of gourmet sandwiches.

Venezia Italian Gelato , 7/4/2016 Updated review Wonderful experience of incredible gelato. Clean environment with plenty of seating and amazing selection of flavors and combinations.

Venezia Italian Gelato ," 6/20/2016 I'm joining the chorus to say that Venezia is fantastic! Everything about my pop-in for a gelato on a sweltering summer afternoon felt authentically Italian. The proprietor is friendly and proud of his offerings, the flavors are familiar and yet somehow elevated, and the store is modern, spotlessly clean, and surprisingly large.  I went for a traditional pistachio and hazelnut for my first visit while my friend opted for two fruit flavors. All were so delicious that we were plotting our return trip before we left the store.  I want to tell everyone about Venezia because it may be a little less showy than some of its counterparts around town, but it is damn fine gelato. The real deal. ", pos 
Venezia Italian Gelato , 7/27/2016 Love love loveeee this place!! I'm glad I found this new hole in the wall. It's easy to miss this place and turning into it is kind of hard -- but I assure ya it's worth it. I've tried other flavored but I ALWAYS get black cherry and passion fruit. You get two scoops for a small size so you can pick 2 flavors , pos

The owners are brand new here; they came here straight from Italy so you know this is the real deal.  Compared to the other gelato places in Austin, this place's flavors are lighter but still taste very desserty.  The consistency is more like ice cream -- but healthier I guess? Right?  You must come here nowwwwww. ", pos 
Venezia Italian Gelato ," 6/19/2016 1 check-in I've been trying to decide whether or not I should keep this place a secret. But I want them to do well and figured, I shouldn't be selfish. So here I am writing a review for the best gelato I have ever had.  Venezia is located off of South Lamar, right next to a tattoo shop, and if you blink, you might miss it. It doesn't have flashing lights waving you down saying ""THE BEST GELATO HERE"" but it does have the Italian flag, which pretty much says they're legit, no?  Upon walking in, we were greeted straight away with warm smiles. The owners are so sweet and friendly, and that made my whole experience that much better. The wife took care of us, allowing us to sample whatever we pleased. I tried the Passion Fruit, to which she made sure I understood to try the whole sample at a time, so that all 3 layers of flavors would mix together. And boy was she right. As soon as I took the entire sample, my eyes grew bigger and she could see that I was amazed! It was so delicious, words can't even begin to describe it.  My boyfriend and I ended up getting the Hazelnut and Passion fruit gelato. No regrets there.  The decor inside is cute and simple and if I could, I would live here. When we left, the owners said their thank yous and I quote, ""ciao"", still with smiles on their faces. It was 10 minutes before their closing time, and they still had a positive attitude.  From the moment we stepped foot into the place to the moment we stepped out, they were welcoming and I can't rave enough about the service here. The gelato was fantastic but the experience was even better.  I want this place to stay open for a while and possibly for forever. I want this husband and wife duo to succeed, so go. Go out and support this business, because I have never felt so much love for and from a place before. Passion fruit on top and hazelnut at the bottom ", pos 
Venezia Italian Gelato , 8/27/2016 Amazingly perfect! The inside ambience and the people makes it a must visit place. I read the online review and went there to get Mr.Ring! The owners gave me a warm welcome and they offered to decorate the Ring for the occasion.  Service was one of the best. The owner also offered me few flavors of Gelato to try (even though he knows i was not there to buy gelato). The flavoring was top notch.  Will be definitely back to try their coffee range and buy more Mr.Rings and gelato! Best place to hangout. , pos 
Venezia Italian Gelato ," 8/30/2016 1 check-in I absolutely fell IN LOVE with the Ferrero Rocher gelato. I had it served with one scoop of the coffee flavor in a medium cup, where I quickly ate up the coffee just so I can savor the Ferrero Rocher. It was total bliss and I was immediately saddened that I didn't go up one size.  The amiable Italian owner added an even sweeter impression to our first visit. We asked him about the Tiramisu and even though my boyfriend didn't understand his accent, he was sold by the man's passionate description and tried it out.  I didn't even bother to try the Tiramisu, nor the Mr. Ring's (gelato donuts) which I originally went in for, after sampling the gelato. I'm now on a mission to find a gelato place in Houston that tastes as good, if not, I'll be coming back real soon! ", pos

It wasn't that difficult to find their business, but the parking lot is small.  They allow two sample for free before making your selection.  My son chose a small with two flavors, my husband had a waffle cone, and I chose a medium because I wanted three flavors.  I had the passion fruit, mango, and cappuccino.  I think the passion fruit was my favorite because it had a thin layer of chocolate and was the perfect combination.  We all enjoyed our treats and will definitely return next time we have a craving for gelato. ", pos

Venezia Italian Gelato ," 7/30/2016 1 check-in I had a small sized gelato, half cherry and half pistachio.  Gelato was nice and smooth. Pistachio tasted like real pistachios, just as it should and was not overly sweet. It was very good.  The cherry was lovely. Again, not too sweet and a bit of tartness from the pieces of cherry.  It also had a sort of jelly/jam like topping as they scoop it, which had a slight tart/sourness to it. I sampled the cheesecake and passion fruit, both were delicious. Small size is perfect because the gelato is rich and flavourful. Very friendly service and the pricing is right.  I'd much rather pay $4 for a delicious gelato here, than $7-8 for gimmicky ice cream you can get at other places. I'll be back! ", pos 
Venezia Italian Gelato , 7/17/2016 1 check-in The real deal traditional Italian gelato in Austin. Not sure what to write other than go here for the real deal.

Venezia Italian Gelato ," 7/23/2016 Not to toot my own horn but I'm sort of an amateur gelato aficionado of sorts. I sometimes pull an all out Ratatouille and spit out freezer burned ""gelato"" out of my mouth in Austin because let's face it, most of the gelato here in our great city is not legit.  Enter Venezia Gelato. This great couple has been in Austin for a year straight from Venice and they serve up the most authentic gelato on this side of the Atlantic. I seriously haven't had better gelato in Seattle, LA, or Vancouver BC. So I am extremely happy we have a great spot here in Austin now.  My favorite surprise was the chocolate which was almost a frozen high quality cake frosting (the only way I know how to describe it which doesn't do it justice) which paired extremely well with my cookies and cream. Not to mention Italian true espresso to complement the ice cream and close out the day. The decor was modern and quaint and this would be the perfect spot to bring a date for lunch or after dinner. Bravo! ", pos

Venezia Italian Gelato ," 6/10/2016 ""I'd have to get a second job if this were closer to our house,"" said my husband after our first visit here. Every flavor more delicious than the next. Super authentic gelato. I'd say this has claimed the title of best frozen dessert in austin. ", pos 
Venezia Italian Gelato , 9/8/2016 Mm they had a hazelnut nutella type gelato in summer. Coffee gelato is good. It's right next door to the tattoo shop. (I missed it driving past last time) They have delicious gelato & the man & woman who own the place are from Italy & so nice & welcoming & always having good conversation with the customers. A perfect gelato business we're lucky to have in Austin! , pos 
Venezia Italian Gelato ," 6/5/2016 BEST GELATO EVER!!!! I spent a summer in Sicily and tried a few other places in Austin that I like, but this place is hands down the best dessert you will ever eat! The owners are an adorably sweet couple and the actually remembered me and my friend a month later at our 2nd visit! It's kind of tucked away on Lamar and hard to see so I hope the word gets out. They let you try any flavor, but it's so hard to choose! Seriously you have to stop by ", pos 
Venezia Italian Gelato ," 6/18/2016 After sampling several gelato places across the country, Venezia is by far #1 on my list.  The favors and variety cannot be matched!!  The authenticity of true Italians cannot be matched, each time I've been in, and it's been several...the owners have always been so nice and treating everyone as if they are long lost friends.    The decor is kept clean and simple with a black and white theme.  If you haven't been... You must go; and go now!!  Enjoy!! I'll see you there ", pos 
Venezia Italian Gelato ," 7/1/2016 Best gelato in ATX (and believe me, I've tried the all). The only bad thing is that all of the flavors are amazing and it's impossible to decide which one to get. I ultimately got the pistachio, hazelnut, and cherry. The nutty flavors in the pistachio and hazelnut are incredible. And the cherry is not too sweet and made with luxardo cherrys, giving it a ton of delicious depth. Only other place I've had gelato this good is Italy! Best gelato in ATX! My favorite flavors are the pistachio, hazelnut, and cherry. But you really can't go wrong with any of the flavors. ", pos

Venezia Italian Gelato ," 5/1/2016 1 check-in I noticed this new bright light beacon in the night as I was driving through my hood down Lamar. And was pumped when I noticed it said Gelato. YES YES YES! So I tired it out last night. When we walked in, I was in love with the decor, the open air of the place, and the super friendly owners and their family that was there. They said they just opened and seemed so excited to show us their products. I've NEVER seen Gelato like this. I think that means all the other ""gelato"" places in Austin, most likely aren't the real deal. My gf and I tried pretty much all the flavors. They were amazing. I don't know how I picked just two! I can't wait to go back and see more new flavors each week. This is great, so close to my house, and so yummy! A WIN FOR '04!!!! ", pos

Venezia Italian Gelato ," 5/8/2016 Hands down, the best gelato I've ever had. In fact, I'm not sure I can even say I've had proper gelato after having had theirs.  There's so much flavor packed into each scoop and their flavors are phenomenal. My personal favorites are the chocolate hazelnut (imagine Nutella but 1000% better) and passion fruit.  The owners are so friendly and kind which only adds to it all.   My Italian friend says this is as close as it gets to what you find in Italy and I'll believe her.  Plenty of parking and places to sit and enjoy this little gem of a place. It's quiet now because they just opened but it's not going to be long before they're packed out. ", pos

Venezia Italian Gelato ," 5/26/2016 Came here one evening as I was in the mood for a late night treat. The owners were super friendly and their gelato did not disappoint!  I tried a couple of different flavors (the Venezia was amazing!) and all were incredibly rich, smooth, and delicious. I ultimately got a cherry, pomegranate, and passion fruit combination which was to die for. The fruit flavors all came together perfectly.  I definitely recommend checking it out if you're in the area and looking for a tasty treat!! ", pos 
Venezia Italian Gelato , 8/16/2016 This place is a must if you want authentic Gelato!! Try the cherry gelato. The gentleman helping us explained that the cherries are shipped from Italy. I have never had cherries that delicious. And they combine it with the gelato! Winning!! I can't wait until our next trip. , pos 
Venezia Italian Gelato ," 7/12/2016 This place deserves nothing short of 5 stars. I ordered a medium (3 flavors) with passion fruit, hazelnut and Texas pecan. These guys know what they are doing! I couldn't resist the temptation and ordered two more scoops of straciatella and the Venezia. Venezia is the best flavor I have tasted in gelato. It tastes a lot like the inside of a ferrerro rocher. This is now my weekly dessert spot! ", pos 
Venezia Italian Gelato ," 8/21/2016 Amazing, amazing, amazing. Beyond the delicious and authentic gelato, the owners of this establishment are beautifully educated immigrants from Italy who completely embody the American Spirit.

It totally took me back to my favorite gelato shop in Rome, and it even has colorful gelato on a stick for all the kids and kids at heart!

My favorite flavors are the Venezia and hazelnut, but you can absolutely taste the quality of fresh ingredients and care that the owners put into all of their gelato. The gelato itself is so rich, creamy, with flavors that really stand out.  I actually met the owner when I went in the shop today and he is genuinely kind which helped make this my new favorite gelato spot here in Austin. Venezia can promise an authentically made gelato because the owners are actually from Italy and have a really cool family history of being in this business so you can be sure they'll do things right.

Venezia Italian Gelato ," 6/6/2016 In short, it's the real deal.  The creamy gelattos are incredibly rich and have great texture.  The fruit gelattos aren't oversweet, and have strong natural flavors.  The dark chocolate was perfect, and the hazelnut was just as strong.  They also have a number of vegan options.

Epoch Coffee ," 12/4/2016 Sister Epoch! I really like the coffee here, I like the coffee at the OG Epoch...all the same. The staff is great here. There are plenty of seats and the bathrooms are CLEAN!!!  The only complaint I have is that the seats aren't cushy like the OG Epoch, they're kinda hard. And it doesn't have nearly as much character as Epoch 1.  It's a solid choice for knowing it's not going to be packed, it WILL be quiet, you will get great service, and you WILL get work done. :) ", pos 
Epoch Coffee ," 12/4/2016 1 check-in Perfectly fine coffee shop. The coffee is good, but nothing outstanding. Their Drip of the Day was a bit too watery for me. Had to add a lot of sugar to it. Their mocha was very good though, nice and full-flavored.  The interior was pretty neat. Understated with plenty of seating. Perfect place to be on a chilly, rainy day. ", neutral 
Epoch Coffee ," 10/25/2016 1 check-in I'd be wanting to try this spot for a long time and when the opportunity finally presented itself, I eagerly jumped!  After circling the lot a few times for a parking spot, I contemplated if this was worth a to-go latte, but I was determined. The coffee shop is tucked away in The Village shopping center with the hellish aforementioned parking lot of customers of all the various business competing for a spot.  Already a little defeated by the time I entered Epoch, I was welcomed by a relaxing atmosphere with a ton of seating options. I immediately realized it was a coffee shop really designed for people looking to plug-in and get some serious work done. They even have a nice patio in the back to take your work outside. If I have a long work day in the future, I'll know to go here to get in the zone, however for a casual meet-up, this might not be your place.  While there's definitely not a sense of urgency with the wait staff, it was more the lack of customer service that left a little more to be desired for me. In addition, compared to the standard sizes seen elsewhere in coffee shops, the large was more like a small. ", neutral 
Epoch Coffee ," 11/20/2016 1 check-in Cute place. Try the Mojo iced coffee... bomb.com. Plenty of indoor space: tables, bar seating and sofas. There's a quaint little outdoor seating area out back-- a portion of the outdoor space is covered. As far as the service, eh... it's not the best; friendly, but a bit slow to acknowledge their customers, which was a bit awkward to experience and to watch. All in all, Epoch is a pretty good coffee spot. I'd return for the Mojo. Chai Chai and mojo ", pos 
Epoch Coffee ," 8/3/2016 I'm not sure what it is about this place, but I feel like every time I step foot in it I am being silently judged by the baristas, like they don't think I'm jiggy-enough-with-it to be in their presence. I also think it's strange they only have 2 or so latte flavors... the first time I visited I desperately scanned their tiny menu for even a hint of options, but alas, vanilla it was.  I can't quite explain it, just something about the vibe here makes me wanna whip my phone out and Google Map other coffee shops. ", neutral

Epoch Coffee ," 2/4/2016 8 check-ins Listed in Austin Espresso Essentials Epoch has a wonderful hipster vibe to it - great ambience and really chill, friendly workers. They also have a wide menu - pour over, drip, cold brew, and espresso coffee drinks as well as a number of teas. The staff is also very helpful, answering questions any customers may have, and are easy to converse with.  I ordered a simple latte, and sat at the bar, but there is a wide range of seating from couches to small tables. Their espresso has a wonderful bitter coffee taste - super satisfying. I will warn that if you prefer sweeter drinks, you may want to order something with an added flavor of some kind. I've also heard their french press is great, but haven't tried it yet.  It's the perfect spot to catch up with friends or work. I'll come here again if I'm ever in North Austin! Latte + Vanilla Latte ", pos 
Epoch Coffee ," 7/29/2016 3 check-ins This location is on par with it's OG location (North Loop) it terms of drinks and the atmosphere is pretty good. I really love that they serve hot tea pots here. But I have a few issues:  1. The food. They have a decent kitchen just sitting there. When they first opened they used to make snacks and this was awesome! Now, the food and selection is sub par and unappetizing -- everything is prepackaged and brought in. The OG location does this too but they have way better vendors.  2. The hours. They used to be open until midnight but now close at 10pm. I hate this especially since the other location is 24 hours. While I don't think this location should be open 24 hours, I'm not sure why they're closing so early when the place is still really busy at 10pm. Bring back later hours... 12pm Thursday, Friday, Sat? Makes sense being next to Alamo Draft House.  3. The music. It's way too loud most of the time. I just heard a lady say ""it's too loud in here I can't hear you let's go outside"". The baristas often have the music BLASTING to where you will have a hard time hearing the person in front of you. I can't think. Don't even try talking a call inside... They also play weird shit. Play something your general customer population will enjoy, I'm not into your 80s metal. *** As I am writing this! A second group of moved out side ""is it quite out there?"" *** ", neutral

Epoch Coffee ," 7/31/2016 The coffee at this place is tricky, because once you come here, you might compare the taste of coffee at other shops and it wont do it for you.  The first time you try their iced latte with a shot of vanilla and sweetened to perfection, you will never feel the same euphoric feeling again, and its kind of a bummer.    But its better to have had this just once in your life then never again.  Oh and every time I go there, the baristas are very nice.  You never get the coffee snob vibe, which personally turns me off to some coffee shops. ", pos 
Epoch Coffee ," 7/16/2016 This place has great coffee and pastries.  However, it's hit or miss with the baristas.  Some are lovely and friendly, others are typical hipster with an attitude.

Epoch Coffee ," 6/10/2016 I'm not from Austin, but I've been to more than few coffee shops here. When I'm staying in North Austin, Epoch is my new fave. There's plenty of space, a back area with tables, and super fast wifi. Like legit. I went to another spot in east Austin and they were rocking dial up...like for real. I heard the modem times when trying to connect (older folks know what I'm talking about). Anyway, there's no problem with connectivity at Epoch. Plus, the bartenders are super friendly. What more do you need when you're writing/studying/on a blind date? It's comfortable and the coffee is great. Check it out next time your in north Austin. ", pos

Epoch Coffee ," 9/1/2015 1 check-in I really liked the original Epoch location near airport blvd. I have good memories there, drinking coffee with my friends and eating good pasteries. I saw this new location when I was going to Madam mam's for lunch and instrantly I kenw that that is the place that I would like to go for a cup of coffee after the lunch.  I like this place, the atmosphere, and nice people working there. Everyhing should be above four strats. Except, the taste of coffee. I am not a coffee expert so my taste toward coffee may be very particular. I like dark french roast but when I tried the ""regular"" drip coffee. It was very sour. I know some coffee beans (or the type of roasting) have sour flavor but that's not the style of coffee that I prefer. So this review may be very skewed.  Definetly a good location and parking is fairly easy. Coffee break ", neutral 
Epoch Coffee ," 3/21/2016 Another good coffee shop in Austin... I'm really amazed at how many places in this city are on point with their espresso. This location is tidy and comfortable. A good balance between shops that are so minimalistic you feel like you are in a museum art piece, and the places that feel like they haven't been cleaned in a dozen years. Like most places, I try an Americano the first time I stop in and unlike many places the Americano was perfect. I could imagine this place is slammed on the weekends given the location but I came in on a Monday afternoon. Plenty of seats taken by people with laptops and tablets, but still more than adequate seating.  Barista's seemed chill and friendly enough for me. ", pos 
Epoch Coffee ," 10/6/2016 Meh. I was excited to try a new coffee shop while I was on this side of town. I wasn't greeted at all, no smile, no thank you by the cashier nor the barista. Coffee was decent tasting but not even that hot. I guess I'm not cool enough for this place. ", neutral

Epoch Coffee ," 6/15/2015 1 check-in I agree with the general star rating for this location... Call me picky! and I am when it comes to my coffee... :D especially if they set my expectations for good coffee, and especially if they have some good tools to make it... Also I expect that hip vibe from the place, stylish cups and warm welcome environment. Epoch disappointed on a few of those parameters... The space is large, but lacks style and atmosphere, feels like an old sandwich shop that was rented for, what I expected to be, a great coffee shop.  Now, my cappuccino... It's espresso and foam, people! A lot of foam (not macchiato) and not much milk (not a latte). It looked pretty, but was all milk inside... Sight... May be their sandwiches are great... And the Internet is pretty fast. So, may be I will be back, just make sure to have lower expectations... They still have better coffee than Starbucks, don't get me wrong :) ", neutral 
Epoch Coffee ," 7/6/2016 I ordered the vanilla almond milk latte and fell in love. It's everything a latte should be . Light fluffy and (for me) perfectly sweet. They make their own syrups in house. The vanilla doesn't overwhelm coffee instead complementing it with every sip. The environment is perfect if you want to come study in a cool , laid back atmosphere.  The barista was so sweet and patient with me and all of my questions. ""What's good here?"" ""Do u have vanilla almond milk?"" Ect.

Epoch Coffee ," 7/20/2014 4 check-ins I have held off on reviewing this place as I am very torn between three or four stars.  I have landed on three as I have come here several times, and have always taken my coffee away, as I am never compelled to stay here.  The coffee and staff are great, but cleanliness and ambiance are lacking.  My favorite is the cold brew coffee (sourced from Texas coffee roasters).  Their espresso is also tasty (sourced by Cuvee).  By the afternoon the pastries are limited and look stale, there is a small kitchen that serves up East End pies, and some interesting sounding food bowls and sandwiches.  Not really any fast take away gluten free options. The comfortable couch section off to the side looks dank and dirty sometimes, and just a hint too dark.  The rest of the seating area is cleaner, and they do have a nice small outside patio when the weather is right.  What is up with the ladies bathroom?  The door is still missing, and the useable stall looks like it was cleaned several weeks ago.    I also like that this place is open till 12 am, which makes a quick take away coffee before heading to a late night Alamo movie convenient See all photos from Mindy H. for Epoch Coffee ", neutral 
Epoch Coffee ," 3/14/2015 1 check-in On convenience, really good wireless connectivity. friendliness ...they are really really good, but if rating them on coffee...it is definitely meh.  But then not everyone is obsessed about that kind of stuff like me.  And when I say coffee ...I don't mean a latte, but a pour over or do a espresso. They guys have a pretty expensive machine to pull espressos, let they are always a let down with a very thin watery to non-existent crema, pour overs are done so hurriedly that once does not really get the full extraction of flavor for what otherwise should be a great cup of coffee coming from Cuvee.  On the other side of coin is easy accessibility, really good connection speeds, reasonable service and fairly helpful staff then ends up with this place being A-OK. A fairly pedestrian espresso. ..no discernable crema ", neutral 
Epoch Coffee ," 5/7/2016 Since all of my other reviews on Yelp tend to be complaints (sorrynotsorry) I thought I'd give a shout out to one of my favorite spots to quaff caffeine and work. The staff is friendly, kind, and  quick, the atmosphere is chill and has the paradoxical feel of an industrial space that is also and inviting. The coffee is strong and ethically sound, they have a small but decent selection of GF snacks, and even though sometimes it gets so crowded I've walked in and turned right back around to leave, mostly there is room at the inn. Their pretty authentic, homemade chai is the perfect combination of flavorful and potent but not too sweet. If you're used to a super sugary chai you might look elsewhere. I only wish they stayed open later here, like their rougher-around-the-edges sibling on North Loop. ", pos 
Epoch Coffee ," 10/27/2015 I love this place. I've been going for around a year and a half now and it is my go-to spot. The atmosphere is awesome and great for getting work done. It's also very chill, so showing up in the evening to chat with friends or work on group projects is fun, but the best part about Epoch is the baristas. They make an effort to know your name and have conversations with you and all are very friendly and offer suggestions if you're looking for something new to drink. The music selection kind of goes everywhere, but I kind of like it. It's never the same thing. They even offer a place to display art and don't take a cut if you sell anything. The coffee is also very good after they changed to a new brand a few months ago.  I think the only reason I have to not give 5 stars is that the internet is finicky at best and doesn't work at all at worst. It seems to work best in the mornings when very few people are in, but you start jumping between their two routers around noon and into the evening. I wouldn't say much about it except it is kinda of a 'working' coffee-shop, and if I KNOW I need internet that day for a client, I have to pass and go somewhere I know I won't get dropped or work from home.  All that being said, this is still my #1 place to go in Austin. Great atmosphere, very relaxing and not too loud so I can concentrate on what I'm doing or hear a conversation I am having with a friend. Keep up the good work guys! ", pos 
Epoch Coffee ," 10/11/2015 I've been a regular at Epoch for a little over a year now. I keep coming back because the atmosphere is chill, the house-made chai is good, and the baristas are friendly and knowledgeable.  Yes, the music selection is quirky-sometimes they play a little too much Kate Bush or have an odd mix going on in the background-but it's rarely too distracting for getting work done.  They're working on being more personable by asking names and having more conversations with customers, and most of their baristas are coming from other coffee shops around town.  I haven't yet had a reason not to return. The plentiful parking and convenient north location are also big wins. ", pos

Epoch Coffee ," 3/20/2014 Updated review 6 check-ins This was my favorite new discovery, but sadly it did not last. Parking had always been awful, but there has not been any seating the last two times I've gone in and prices were just increased $0.50 for all drinks (except the cortado, I think). I know $0.50 isn't a lot, but the original prices were already higher than Starbucks and I don't feel like Epoch deserves any slack for mispricing when they have had another store open for years to experiment with. Also, my usual cappuccino had always been served in their bigger cups (about 12 oz) and they just recently downsized all drinks (except mochas, as far as I can tell) to their small cups (about 8 oz).  Updated prices, for reference:  Cappuccino: $3.25 to $3.75 (Starbucks Tall = $2.75) Latte: $3.50 to $4.00 (Starbucks Tall = $2.75) Mocha: $3.75 to $4.25 (Starbucks Tall = $3.25) Drip: $2.00 to $2.50 (Starbucks Tall = $1.65)  If you're rich and willing to pay a buck more for less coffee, of course Epoch tastes better. But if you're a poor student like me, back across the street to Starbucks it is... New menu as of 05/06/14, but careful because it'll probably be completely different tomorrow ", neutral

They also sell it by the package to enjoy at home.  Ritual was started in the heart of the Mission district in San Francisco by Eileen Hassi in 2005. I remember when I worked at Flora Grubb Gardens Eileen teaching me about coffee flavors and roasting while she hand stamped her paper cups with a rubber stamp.

Epoch Coffee ," 12/18/2013 118 check-ins Listed in ""Nuptial Coffee Bliss!"", Anderson Lane is the new Black This new Anderson Epoch bears the same resemblance with its North Loop sibling as I have with my own sister - absolutely none. I should probably disclose I don't actually have a sister.  And since we're in disclosing mode, let me mention my coffee consumption has gone from two quarts a day to less than two cups, because it's my worst trigger for smoking ever. The point being nothing pisses me off quicker these days than tepid swill posing as coffee. That puts me in a really really, dark place.     I'm happy to report this new Epoch is all sunshine and rainbows. Their $2 house pour using my cup was wonderful. They have Russell's pastries, a real kitchen from 10am-2pm, and WiFi blazing at 10m-down. A laid-back & friendly staff who appear to enjoy working there. And granted this place is brand-spanking new, but it's so clean and sterile here that you can literally do coffee bean surgery right off the floor. If you want to feel personality, head over to the North Loop Epoch, you'll have to give this Anderson Epoch a little more time to develop.    The bottom line is let's see how they fare, with Starbie's around the corner and Genuine Joe's up the street. Maybe they're shooting for the post-Alamo crowd, or the Anderson Lane lunch-hoppers. Maybe if you build it, they will come. I do know this new Epoch has good coffee and it's a pleasant respite. In this particular hip & cool gentrified section of town, it's almost quietly epic. No particular reason why I like this pic, I just do. Okay, I like playing with contrasts & angles. They make a pretty cortado here for $3. Awww, coffee art.

Epoch Coffee ," 1/24/2016 This is one of the better executed coffee shops that we have visited in Austin. There is plenty of seating, different types of seating, spread out, outdoor even. The music is loud enough to blend the noises but not enough to take over your brain. We can't speak to the coffee. For us, coffee is either drinkable or not: it was fine. We didn't try the wifi which is normally important to us but other reviewers said it is fine. The only suggestion is to integrate some textile into the decor to absorb some of the background noise given all of the hard surfaces. ", pos

Answered all our questions and treated each customer before us, to include us, like we were friends.  Small conversation and just being genuinely nice.    Cappuccino was apparently the best one my g/f had ever experienced.  I had a blood orange tea that was unique and delicious.  I really like that they fill their own tea bags.  The set up is made for studying, so if you want to have a conversation, it's a bit awkward, but not that bad.  They have some table games and couch/lounge areas to be a bit more secluded and play games. ", pos 
Epoch Coffee ," 7/9/2014 Updated review I like Epoch coffee still. Clean lines, fast wifi, great A/C, new outside seating. I haven't resampled food and I'm not going to buy those pastries sitting there since 8am.  Here's the gig though. It's been 7 months and that bathroom is still a broken down mess. The door to the second stall is still off. The towel dispenser is hanging open like a gaping maw with sodden roll of towel on top. The one bathroom that does function has grimy floors and the TP is off the roll sitting on the handicap bar.  There are 30 people in here and one lonely barista trying to do it all which makes wait times long and her life miserable (I'm sure.) I expect some of these things at the old location which is arguably less put together but I thought they'd fix some of these things in the half year they've been open. ", neutral

Then you have to fend for yourself. I didn't want to go to Starbucks either. It's a nice area with old school furniture and there are board games.  Their coffee hits the spot.

I have to say their iced coffee is good, albeit a little on the acidic side (which is somewhat typical in cold brews anyway).   They make amaaaaazing espresso -- very smooth and drinkable.  People who work here seem decent and knowledgable.  I haven't ever had an issue I needed resolved, so I'm not entirely sure how they handle that sort of thing.  Prices are a couple quarters more than I would expect on most drinks.  Nice chill vibe in the shop, and lots of seating.  Girl's bathroom is really spacious and clean.

There's lots of comfortable seating: several couches, lots of tables for working, and a patio out back.

Epoch Coffee ," 5/10/2015 The drinks here are pretty top notch, especially if you consider your options in the area. Usually they only have one person working up front, which for me is fine, never the impatient one.  Russell's pastry's are offered from the front counter which I've never been a fan of, but this review is based solely on the coffee & the service I've received. Not sure why people are annoyed that they sit out all day. I've worked at many places that sell pastries (including whole foods) if you think they are being rotated out in an hourly basis, you're not very food smart..  I usually order a cortado & it never really disappoints. Texas coffee traders is served for ice coffee instead of the cuvée that is used for espresso. I love TCT & wish they would be able to shine a bit more in Austin. The tea selection here is pretty good, I get the white blueberry iced sometimes, haven't been to very many places that offer fancy teas, cooled.  The only thing that bugs me is the barista will often ignore me when I'm next in line & loudly chat to a friend that has walked in behind me. Usually the friends order is taken first & then I'm left with a smug, ""what can I get you?"" I know this isn't the owner, who is kinda quiet, which doesn't bother me. Just something that irks me.. I'm a regular, but not a stay too long chatty kind of person. This of course doesn't deter me from coming back, just an excuse for a soul eye roll.  All in all I really like the vibe of this place, it's always really clean, the music is perfect in the AM, the coffee is delicious & they have a good patio in the back. ", pos

Epoch Coffee ," 2/19/2014 3 check-ins Listed in 2014 Yelp 100 Challenge, West Anderson? Best Anderson., The best part of waking up is Cuvée in your cup! Let me tell you a thing - this place is just the cutest. Everybody already knows that I have a favorite coffee shop in Austin, but I decided that I could have a south Austin favorite and a north Austin favorite, but the south Austin favorite is still number one. Wait, maybe they can be tied for first because I don't want either of them to feel second best.  It doesn't matter what time of day I come here - the staff members are just straight up adorable. They ask you about your day and they care about your answer; heck, they'll even have a full on conversation with you! The standard, ""Hi, how are you?"" is not just an automated response here; it's a genuine question backed by real curiosity. Call me a sucker for human warmth, but, well... okay, I'm just a sucker for that kind of thing. (When I worked in retail, I tried to do the exact same thing because seeing someone's face light up when they see that you are actually engaging them as a person instead of treating them as yet another customer is positively wonderful. It's the little things that matter most, you know?)  They serve Cuvée coffee here, which is my favorite type of coffee and pretty much the only coffee I will drink. I went from never drinking coffee to only drinking one specific brand of coffee. My brain is so silly sometimes. The one time I ordered a hot chocolate, I asked if they could sprinkle cinnamon on the top because that is my favorite way to drink hot chocolate, and they informed me that they use a Mexican chocolate that already has cinnamon in it. They did not lie and that hot chocolate just might be my favorite hot chocolate in Austin.  Then there's the story of how I went on one of the cutest first dates ever - I suggested Epoch because it was centrally located to my office and his apartment. As we were ordering, I mentioned that this was our first date and the barista said, ""No way. You're kidding, right?"" I laughed and told him, no, I was not kidding. ""I never would have guessed. It seems like you two have known each other for forever."" I took this as a good sign since I had literally met this guy not one minute before that exchange.  The date went very well and we stayed there chatting for some time. At some point, maybe two hours in, the same barista walks to our table with a slice of cheesecake and says, ""Because it seems like your first date is going well."" My heart melted right then and there. How thoughtful is that? He brought us a slice of cheesecake because our date was going well. I just can't get over how sweet that gesture was.  I just can't even with how cute this place is and how warm and fuzzy it makes me feel inside. Everyone here is so thoughtful and kind and genuine and there's something about that that I just love. I live for those connections, however small, because it's those connections that keep us all going at the end of the day, and any place that makes my inner social worker sing has found a forever fan in me.

I still don't know what it is, so don't ask me.  This is another version of the ever so popular, open 24 hour coffee shop on North Loop. This one is not open 24/7, they have human hours.  I like this new location. Its in the Village Shopping Center (near the Alamo DH). The inside needs help. It doesn't feel like a coffee shop. It needs some pizzazz! Something to set it apart. But there is plenty of seating which the other location will never have due to its proximity to campus. They also have a small kitchen, therefore a lot more options for food here. An outside patio is available for smokers and nice weather observers.  On a strange and sadder note: To add to Kelly S's review, the women's restroom is the saddest restroom I've ever seen. There is one stall, and the 2nd one has no door on it. The bathroom reminds me of a bare, sad hospital bathroom. They don't even have good hand soap. They've got that 99cent shit from HEB in there.

They've got solid food menu (from what it seems), but  it's only available until 3pm.  Big space. Most tables are only for two people, so it's not great for big groups.

I love a reasonably quiet place to work and chat. This Epoch new location hits all of those on the nose.  My soy latte was so delicious- really really good espresso, creamy milk- that I didnt even need sugar ( and that's saying a lot for me.)  The only downside. It's already way too popular. The line to get coffee stretched around the bar and halfway to the door. We waited about 45 mins before daring to get in line. Also ( and I am sure its because they are new) they were out of almost everything- mocha syrup, decaf beans ( mine was the last.) Being popular can have its downsides sometimes, but I am sure that it will work out the kinks for the future. ", pos

Epoch Coffee ," 12/20/2013 21 check-ins ROTD 4/28/2014 This review isn't really fair.   I feel like Epoch Coffee moved into this W. Anderson location because I WILLED it to happen.  The cosmos knew I wanted an excellent cafe in the empty space next to our office, and they made it happen.    I couldn't be happier.  First, I appreciate the design/layout.  They leased a long, narrow, weird-shaped, old space and made it BEAUTIFUL.   This is not an easy feat.  I know, I tried to do the same with our office location.  You can tell that the design was very well thought out.  Lots of warm woods, excellent lighting, art on the walls, and seating that satisfies the hard-working lone-wolf and the socialite.    I really love the ordering area.  The minimal aesthetic brings the focus to what they do best: coffee.   They have pour-overs, several selections of beans and grinds, and (the pièce de résistance) the incredible Strada espresso machine.   If you are a coffee connoisseur, you won't be disappointed.    As for the food, I am thrilled.  I like to eat healthy.  Our office is surrounded by some of the best food in Austin (Bartletts, Phonatic, Hopdoddy, Verts etc) but we don't have a lot of healthy alternatives.  Last time I ate at Epoch, I had an incredible Vegan Club sandwich.  It is very cool that a place that specializes in coffee can make food this good.  Most importantly, the people there are awesome.  Everyone on our team loves going to Epoch and talking to their team.   They like great music, they know coffee, and they are extremely friendly.   I am big fan, and I will be in Epoch often.

This location has a more modern feel to it than the other location, which is nice...I like having diversity without having to sacrifice deliciousness! They'll get another star out of me when they increase they're bakery/food options! Can a girl get a danish or a piece of cake?? ", pos 
Epoch Coffee ," 3/17/2014 I live right by the original Epoch on North Loop. It's typically packed - as is Monkey Nest - so it's good to see another coffee shop open up in the area. I hope that this will provide some much needed relief.  It's a fairly small place, but the space is well utilized. Couches at the front provide lots of seating for socialization. Along the side wall is a row of two-seater tables good for those on a date or (as most people were) working on laptops. There are about three 4-seater tables in the back. It also seemed that they had a back patio.  Small selection of pastries from Russell's bakery. They also have a kitchen that makes sandwiches and salads from 10-2.  Service was good, coffee is what you expect. Overall, I'm very happy this place opened up here. ", pos

Epoch Coffee ," 1/16/2014 1 check-in I did a happy dance when the permit went up for Epoch many months ago because we could really use a non-chain coffee purveyor with good hangout space on Anderson Lane. (Yes, I know Genuine Joe's is just down the road, but it has heating/cooling issues and you roll the dice on surly service each and every time.)  I finally paid Epoch a visit and am pleased. It's the brighter, cleaner cousin to the original outpost on North Loop. You'll still have a smattering of hipsters and quite a few gamers, but they peaceably coexist alongside solo students with their noses in books and chatty friends catching up on their week. There are tables, benches, sofas, comfy chairs, plentiful outlets...something for everyone.  Unlike a previous reviewer who found the service abrasive, I was struck by how friendly the barista and the fellow who gave me the wi-fi password were. I enjoyed my piping hot, cinnamon-y mocha so much that I also sipped away on my husband's when he declared his too strong. The only hiccup was the temperature of the building. Um, was that my breath I just saw? It was really freakin' cold. (And that says a lot, coming from someone who typically runs hot). Oh, and as others have mentioned, it's not a great spot for a snack unless you happen to roll in between 10am and 2pm. Huh? I hope they expand their food hours over time.  Despite my quibbles, I'm so glad to have Epoch (aka Circa 13) in the 'hood. ", pos 
Epoch Coffee ," 2/21/2015 11 check-ins My go-to spot for a latte. They really know what they're doing (coffee-wise.) Lattes usually include a beautiful latte-art design for your (brief) viewing pleasure before you happily drink it down. When the weather is warm, get an iced mojo. Creamy and sweet iced coffee that's gotten me through quite a few study sessions. If super sweet is not your thing, order a half iced mojo. Food- they usually have a fairly good selection of pastries, although they're in this weird, very low-to-the-ground glass case that's built into the counter (can anyone explain to me what's up with that? You're selling scones, not diamond earrings) I digress.. If you need something more substantial to snack on, they sell pizza by the slice from Eastside Pies (try the circa! Feta. Broccoli. Sweet potato. Strange yet oh-so delicious.)  My ONLY reason for not giving these guys five stars is the customer service. It's like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get. ", pos

The Factory - Cafe With a Soul ," 11/30/2016 1 check-in Listed in Brunch Spots I loved the eclectic and homey plush decor and who doesn't want to swing and drink their coffee?  I would categorize this as a pricier coffee place but, to me it was worth it.  After Thanksgiving nobody wants to make brunch so we headed out in search of chicken and waffles.  There is ample parking in the private lot and  ordering is done through I-Pads.  Pick a seat and they will call your name when your items are ready.  Be patient because some of the coffee drinks take longer than others.  I had the cold brew coffee, chicken and waffles and we shared a pop+art!  The po+art was strawberry; light and fluffy on the outside and gooey sweet filling on the inside.  The chicken and waffles wasn't the standard so expect different, complex and interesting flavors from the accompanying slaw and sauce.  I thoroughly enjoyed it but, the waffle was a bit bland and maybe could have used a bit of honey to spruce it up.  The coffee here is spot on and I hear that their hot chocolate is the bomb but, I will have to wait for the weather to cool off to try that.  A great place to be cozy and chat with your friends, a date or read a book. Chicken and waffles Pop tart Coffee See all photos from Carmela S. for The Factory - Cafe With a Soul ", pos

The Factory - Cafe With a Soul ," 11/20/2016 1 check-in Very cute cafe! I think from the moment I stepped in, there really wasn't anything I didn't find cute at The Factory. From their decor to their cups, everything was really cute. It's really the perfect place for a catching up with friends or a coffee date.  When you go order, there's really the least amount of interaction ever with the workers. You just pick your order on an iPad and they'll call your order out after for you to pick up at the counter. The whole thing's pretty novel honestly. I got the Viva Matcha Latte and it was so good! Perfect amount of sweetness and perfect temperature. I went on a cold night and this cafe is just so cozy, it was such a great combination. They have these swings as well which were pretty fun to sit on honestly.  Prices are what I would expect for a cafe like this, not super cheap, but not too pricey. There's no wifi here, so if you want to study, maybe this isn't the right place.

The Factory - Cafe With a Soul ," 10/27/2016 2 check-ins Listed in ""Nuptial Coffee Bliss!"", Anderson Lane is the new Black Oh hey, the pro vs con format. I've never used that before. Let's try it:  Pros: 1. This place is cooler than I thought. 2. It's open until 2am. No, really. 3. They have beer & wine. I didn't know that until I saw the beer taps. They offered me a sample.  Cons: 1. If you have to describe The Factory with one word, it probably won't be ""inexpensive.""  I don't think they're shooting for the ""Sixth Coffeehouse on Anderson Lane but with Flash"" title here, I think they really want to be the official bistro in the neighborhood - far more casual than Bartlett or Hopdoddy, but with a lot more flair than Tea Haus or Starbuck Evenings. Staying open until 2am is a good start, and let's see if they add more to the menu. Remember, no one thought that gentrified Walmart would do well either.  In the meantime, have fun with those chicken & waffles, and their colorful matcha-infused coffees. I'm only interested in straight black, and their pourover Stumptown is great stuff. Try the $5 pop tart at least once, mainly because you can. And then let's meet back here in a couple of weeks, just to see what's been tweaked. This place defines hipster man-cave. I liked the long table with 1/2 bar chairs & stools, & the cool plates & cups. There's a $5 pop tart. ", pos

I finally found a coffee shop I can study at without sacrificing comfort (Starbucks' uncomfortable chairs). The coffee shop endorses social connection, hence, wifi  isn't available. It makes me really happy that a lot of students hang out here with their book bags and laptops and we can all just study in peace and somehow quiet (the background music can get pretty loud). Unfortunately, there will always be that kid who's obnoxiously loud and would like the whole world to know her business. Seriously, unless it's something intriguing or educational, no one cares. In addition, as much ""fun"" as this place looks, it's not child friendly. So parents, make sure your children do not hit the table in front of it and knock out the chess set. Lastly, the sex images in the bathrooms are definitely not appropriate for children.  The ambiance is very much like Austin-- very eccentric and hip! Food and drink presentations are on par. Drink prices are reasonable and similar to good ole Starbucks. But unlike you're typical coffee shop, they have real food such as chicken and waffles.  My favorite about this place is the cleanliness. The employees do a good job maintaining the place. Also, as I watch them make coffees, they do it with fines as if they're creating some type of art, it's pretty cool (in my opinion).  In conclusion, Cafe w/ a Soul is probably the best coffee shop I've ever been to. It's like studying in my own home but away from distractions. I'm awake!

The Factory - Cafe With a Soul ," 10/25/2016 1 check-in Ok, let's try this approach...  Pros: Music Seating Decor General ambiance Service  Cons: iPad ordering (I'm a crotchety old man, kids) Limited coffee menu, or menu in general Relatively expensive Food is pretty but lackluster  I'm still sitting here as I type this and I'm less than overjoyed with the experience, sadly. The space and vibe are great but not quite familiar or intimate enough to beat out a place like Genuine Joe down the street. It seems like they bank on the vibe, and fall short the rest of the way. (This would be a great hangout for the artsy/design crowd having a collaborative meeting.)  The staff is great but the iPad ordering system limits your required interaction with them. They take pride in no wifi to increase interaction but then use iPads instead of people?  Seating is ample, if cramped in a surprisingly large space.  But the food, kids. So pretty, but again lackluster. I tried the Pop+art ($5) and the Nutella Waffle ($4.75) and they both sit on their respective tiny awkward plates half eaten. (Yes the plate liners are cute) The waffle is a great idea but the waffle itself  has no flavor and there's no delight. The tart is similar - the pastry crust is much too thick compared to the Smuckers jam tasting filling and it is essentially just pure sugar. The pastry itself doesn't even taste buttery or crisp. Meh. There appears to be no soul in this confectionary.  Coffee- passable. But at $4 for a cortado and a $1.50 up-charge for almond milk- I'll pick another place.  I get why the reviews are so good here, but there are much better places nearby for that ""cafe with a soul"" feel. This feels like an ACL pop-up. Going for that?  Great, come here.

The Factory - Cafe With a Soul ," 11/17/2016 1 check-in Listed in 2016 - The Third Time is a Charm! The Factory has A+ decor and a very innovative interactionless (tablet) ordering system. This allows you to look up what to get without feeling pressured by a barista staring at you waiting for you to order. The eclectic selection of tables, couches, and swings (?!) inside with a small kiddy corner appeal to many different types of tastes. This is seriously a cool place to hang out.  However, when it comes to the coffee and food, it's rather not cheap. The waffles range from $4-$8, and coffee is between $3.50 and $5. The quality of the coffee is not yet up to par with other coffee mainstays in Austin, so I would probably not choose to come here just for coffee.

I didn't want to tell anyone how awesome The Factory - Cafe With a Soul is because I don't want it overrun and super busy with no place to sit like so many other decent coffee shops in Austin. I happened to come in here with a friend mid-week and we sat here for several hours, enjoying the peace and quiet, the atmosphere, and the awesome coffee.  This place is a little eclectic - lots of peculiar art, books, games, knick-knacks, and an almost head-scratching drink and food menu. Waffles and pop tarts...and beer? And... coffee mojitos? Well, it works. Whatever is going on here, it works fabulously. They serve Stumptown Coffee, which as someone from the Northwest, I totally appreciate. They also brew coffee correctly. There is not a hint of bitterness or overcooked milk going on here. The iPad ordering screens are mostly cool, (although they need more options for customization) and the million different types of seating, (couches, pillows, swings, big chairs, little chairs, bar seating, regular tables) is both delightful and refreshing. The baristas make foam art - something that I have only seen at Houndstooth here in Austin.

The Factory - Cafe With a Soul ," 10/12/2016 1 check-in Checked out The Factory this past Sunday with my husband. We wanted to try their delicious looking waffles and were definitely not disappointed.  Husband ordered an iced coffee drink that was delicious, but it wasn't as good as my Golden Age of Milk Tea, well worth the 10 minute wait for the tea to steep.  We both ordered the Nutella Waffle and it was perfect. From the wood plate with the AMAZING paper liner printed with a famous person and an inspirational quote from them. I wanted just the paper because it was so cute and well done. The waffle is basically half a waffle, spread with Nutella and a layer of bananas, then folded in half. While small, it was a perfect amount, the bananas balancing out the sweetness of the Nutella. The waffle itself was crisp perfection, providing a crunch to the meal. The menu is very limited: there was the nutella waffle and a fried chicken waffle. I'm hoping they'll eventually serve other waffles, but totally respect their decision to start small.  The space is gorgeous. From the swings to the mural above the bar, everything looks meticulously planned out. And here is where my biggest advice comes: this place is really not for kids. The way the seating is set up is really for larger people and there is definitely no place for high chairs. While there is giant magnetic poetry on one of the columns, a crazy chair outside and a couple of table games, the giant chess set looks risky for grabby kids. If you have a well-behaved child who can handle it, I would think its fine. However, I watched several families come in and either leave or order to go, commenting it wasn't the best space for them. While this doesn't bother me (I love kidless spaces), it might be jarring to someone expecting to have brunch with the family.  I am so excited to become a regular here! Great new spot! ", pos

It's super cute and trendy, to the point where it feels kind of out of place in a strip mall. Although I loved the interior design and general ambiance of the place, I was a little disappointed with the menu. This is more of a coffee shop than a cafe - their food options are pretty limited. My friend ordered the chicken and waffles and I ordered Nutella waffles with strawberries and bananas. For the price I paid, the portions were definitely on the smaller side.

Houndstooth Coffee ," 9/23/2016 1 check-in My husband and I paid a visit to Houndstooth after reading several positive reviews online, reporting this coffee shop as one of the best in Austin.  After trying it for ourselves, I have to admit they do serve excellent coffee; my tasty iced latte was very well made. My husband's chai latte was delicious and among the best we've had in the city.  That being said, I found myself a bit shocked when I looked at the bill; the coffee cup size was smaller than what I usually get at other third wave coffee shops, yet the cost was at least a dollar more expensive. Yes, the coffee is good, but is it THAT good? My wallet isn't so sure!  Another point that left me disappointed was the pastries; not only was the selection very limited, but upon asking if the barista could reheat my croissant, he reply they couldn't as they do not have a microwave and that they probably never will have one as they fear customers would ask them to use it to reheat their coffee. Hum, what?  No, I don't want you to put my croissant (or cold coffee for that matter) in the microwave. That's disgusting. I would think however it would be a really smart idea to invest in a mini oven used to bake fresh parties or simply reheat them for 30 seconds. My croissant was cold and a bit lifeless. This problem could so easily be fixed! The way I see it, if you're going to do pastries, do it right or not at all, especially with the high prices you are asking your customers to pay!  Will I be back? I don't know. I'm kind of thrown off by the attitude and prices. That being said, Houndstooth does have great coffee and deserves its fame in that department. ", pos 
Houndstooth Coffee ," 6/3/2016 1 check-in Houndstooth has the best coffee quality in Austin. A little pricy for the size, but the coffee is always great and tasty.  Baristas are all very knowledgeable and kind. They know how to use their fancy coffee brewer and make pretty coffee art. Also, the guys are always well-dressed with nice button down shirts, bow ties and hats. Heh  The shop itself is pretty small, very limited seating with nice decors. When you come during rush time, you'll usually not able to find spots. But the coffee is great to go as well.  Music is a bit too loud and repetitive  music was annoying at times.

I usually hate picking favorites, favorite restaurant, favorite movie, favorite drink, etc. It's such a stressful decision with so many factors. But, Houndstooth is hands down my favorite coffee shop in Austin. It's the only place I get cappucino and know to expect only goodness. They're always consistent, and the baristas friendly.  The only con of this place is that outlets are pretty sparse and the seatings tend to be full most of the time I've gone. It's not a cafe I would study at, but definitely to drop by for a cup to-go or a chatty time with a friend or two.  Oh how I'm going to miss Houndstooth! ", pos

Houndstooth Coffee ," 10/9/2016 First, I'm going to say the 5 stars are for the quality, flavor, atmosphere and overall experience. To read the one hang-up please scroll to the end. We both got mochas. The wait time was good, the baristas are visible and engaging, and you can really tell this is their craft. They love making coffee, and it shows. The aroma when you walk in is delicious and our drinks raised our eyebrows. Even though it was busy we had no problem finding a seat. We were in there about 90 minutes and the line was never shorter than 5 people. I do think they should have a visible menu though.  My one dismay was the cost. We got a 12oz mocha and a 16oz mocha and it was TWELVE DOLLARS. Twelve dollars!!!!!!! By far the most expensive coffee we've ever had, but they had hundreds of customers lined up so it doesn't seem to deter people. The quality was top notch, but I still don't see how you justify that price. Mocha See all photos from Ashley K. for Houndstooth Coffee ", pos

Houndstooth Coffee ," 9/1/2015 9 check-ins Listed in Austin Espresso Essentials Houndstooth is one of my favorite places to study; the environment is great and the place is clean and comfortable. I've only been to the Lamar location, but I really like it!  As for the beverages,  they definitely take their craft seriously at Houndstooth and have several 'daily brews' to choose from. I think Houndstooth has some of the most talented baristas in Austin. Not a place to go if you're looking for something similar to Starbucks' sugary, fake coffee beverage; this is the real deal.  I haven't quite decided if the great bitter taste that I love about Houndstooth is worth the hefty price associated with their drinks. I do really love their coffee, and would prefer it over a lot of other places in Austin, but the price deters me from visiting often.  Also, if you don't prefer the rich coffee taste, I wouldn't come here. I took my sister here who is less favorable with the bitter taste and she had to add quite a bit of sugar to her drink in order to tolerate it.  Upsides: Quality coffee, nice bathrooms, friendly workers  Downsides: Limited menu, hard to find seating during busy hours, super pricey ", pos 
Houndstooth Coffee ," 10/27/2016 I just had the best experience here. I wish I had the name of the girl who helped me. I told her I had coffee-loving family members coming in town and needed help with buying the right coffee. She took her time to explain everything in great detail and even asked a co-worker for a second opinion. I was coming straight from a surgery, so her energy and attitude really lifted my spirits. Obviously, I know little about coffee but this experience will most definitely bring me back. Thank you to this sweet employee. Your kindness did not go unnoticed. ", pos 
Houndstooth Coffee ," 4/19/2016 1 check-in My go-to drink is an iced caramel latte. When a place doesn't have caramel, I opt for vanilla and cinnamon. But houndstooth had vanilla and honey so that's what I ordered. Because I love honey and I'm trying to stop myself from adding syrup or sugar to my coffee after receiving it.  Sweet enough to satisfy me while still letting the coffee flavor (the bitterness) to seep through.  Not enough outlets so that's why I'm docking a star. If I could, I'd actually give this place 3.5 stars because of lack of seating as well. Coffee is a solid 4-5 stars. For some reason, all the outlets are in the back corner of the place, which doesn't make sense considering there's a huge AF table for community seating at the front, but with no outlets around it.

Well.. my tolerance for coffee isn't that insane, so I only need a cup of their hot brewed black coffee and I'm good for the day.  My friend and I always come here after we finish our meal at Tacodeli (next door, check it out!!!!). It's always packed and not exactly a super large shop, so I wouldn't come here to study. It has kind of a hipster vibe cuz on the wall it says ""the pattern of coffee and people"", there's a big shiny fancy machine, and the (very nice) baristas always dress hipster and have big glasses/mustaches.  One time, I had some ""hot"" chocolate-flavored donut recommended by the cashier but it was really weird... I expected cinnamon or something but it was just some actual spicy donut with a bad aftertaste.... Idk yo but after that experience, I would just stick to ordering their coffee. ", pos 
Houndstooth Coffee ," 9/7/2016 Great coffee and environment equally conducive to work, chit-chat or a break at the same time. Yes parking is a problem, just like it is in pretty much any place in downtown. The baristas know their craft, and they don't mind telling you about it either.

Houndstooth Coffee ," 4/17/2016 Based on a rainy Saturday afternoon:  Pros: -interesting layout; really puts the coffee front and center -baristas were VERY friendly and helpful -mocha didn't blow me away, but it was satisfying and had lovely latte art  Cons: -it was super packed 2-5pm with an almost overwhelming amount of noise. By 6:30 it was much calmer and more enjoyable, so it really matters when you go -there are only outlets on one wall of the coffee shop  If I could, I'd give it 3.5 stars. I see why people like it, but I think there's a lot of variance in the actual experience you might have there. Would definitely be up for another visit to get a better feel for it Mocha ", pos 
Houndstooth Coffee ," 11/20/2015 2 check-ins Listed in In Search of Fantastic Coffee Houndstooth is serving up fantastically wonderful coffee, and it is no wonder why they were packed when a friend and I dropped in mid-day on Thursday. The many different types of low chairs, high chairs, outdoor patio seating, and a bar to stand at were pretty much fully packed. There was also a fairly consistent line and the baristas were flowing through orders smoothly. There were a lot of people working, and a lot of people meeting up to sit and enjoy the space.  We both ordered lattes and were seriously blown away by the smoothness of the coffee. It had no bitter qualities, wasn't overly dry, (think like a dry wine on the tongue) and there was a perfect balance between the milk, coffee, and ice in the lattes. I think I paid around $4.50 for my coffee - and for the quality, it is an incredibly fair price. I really can't say enough good things about this place - I just wish it was closer to home for me, I'd probably stop in weekly! ", pos

It feels trendy and cool and hip all at the same time, while delivering on an amazing guest experience.

And, being a Houndstooth, the coffee and the service were good (very good cappuccino - I wasn't surprised), BUT...it's tiny! Tiny, tiny, tiny! So little seating! It was raining outside, so the tables out there were wet and there wasn't any available seating inside - we ended up getting our coffees to go and taking them back to her apartment!

The barista was funny (with just the right level of haughtiness you would expect from someone capable of making such a top-notch drink), and the cafe was clean and spacious.

Houndstooth Coffee ," 9/24/2015 Listed in Thanks a latte! Came in for the first time today in years, just a few minutes after they opened and there was already a small line forming. The advantage to the early morning stop is that you don't have to brave the busy parking lot that fills up rather quickly and it seemed that the barista there was already peppy and ready to take on the day. I watched her joke and laugh along with the girl in front of me, who mentioned she was a 6:30am regular.  Half asleep, I waited at the front while she filled their order, and she kindly asked me what she could get started for me. As I was answering, the man behind me said ""one vanilla latte..oh sorry, didn't see her there."" I rolled my eyes at him as he looked up from his phone. I now had resting bitch face. She replied, seeing my frustration ""I'm sorry, I will get your order in just a minute"" then turning to me ""what would you like?"" I knew before I even answered that this wasn't going to work out. I'm just not the right fit. But I didn't care, none of my regular spots were on my way this morning, Starbucks was closed, and I was running late.  So I halfheartedly asked her what flavored syrups they have for their lattes. She kind of trailed off ""vanilla...honey...."" Luckily, that was just fine. Honey is what I wanted. So I paid for my honey latte to go, remarking ""oh that is so pretty"" when she brought me my drink and tipping her. But I didn't get a smile or a laugh. My resting b* face cost me my morning greeting.  Its not Houndstooth's fault that I found the dude behind me to be a d*. Nor is it their fault that my usual haunts just weren't convenient enough for me today. If I had had more of a pleasant experience coming in today, I would have excused the fact that I paid a little more for a small latte. I will say that as hesitant as she was with the flavors, the honey is spot on. Creamy and rich with just that hint of sweetness. If I was going to meet someone for a quick coffee run or post up with a coworker to update our social media accounts, I might choose houndstooth again.  But bottom line: I'm just not cool enough for this place. ", neutral

However, the ambience at this location is nice. The baristas are very well-educated and know their coffee! If you ever have any questions, don't be afraid to ask them!  Parking can be tough here.

Houndstooth Coffee ," 3/6/2016 Full disclosure: I'm kind of a cheap person. I'm also a coffee lover. As a result, I'm one of those people who thinks that if I'm paying upwards of $8 for an expresso drink, it had better be delicious. Enter Houndstooth, my very favorite coffe shop.  Even though I live in San Antonio, I try to hit this place up every time I'm in Austin. I have been to both locations several times, and whenever I pull into the parking lot, my wallet starts to tremble. Because just about every time I've been here, I've ended up spending ~$40 for a couple of drinks and a bag of beans to take home. Recall, I'm a confessed penny pincher. Never once have I regretted shelling over my precious monies to Houndstooth. It has been worth it every single time.  If you're someone who has a go-to drink you normally order at coffee shops, give it a try here. Chances are you've never had it made as well as these people are going to make it. But if you're the adventurous type--and I would highly enoucourage you to be in this case--check out their seasonal specials. From the chilled coffee julep in the summer to the precious 'Ginger in the Snow' they featured this past Christmas, I have thoroughly enjoyed their seasonal offerings throughout the year.  I should probably note that I've rarely been here during the morning rush. Most of my visits have been later in the day, and there's usually at least a person or two ahead of me. It's like the locals have started catching on to how good this place is. Alas, I guess I'll have to share...

Houndstooth Coffee ," 7/9/2015 A fan for sure. I love this little coffee shop. My experience with Houndstooth was in the evening. The owner/manager was so sweet and talked about all the different coffees they offered, explaining the brewing process with great detail.  This tells me they are passionate about a good cup of coffee and that speaks to this coffee lover.  I went to Houndstooth for an after-dinner coffee experience and it was the perfect setting. If we wanted a fast-food type coffee run with yelling baristas, paper cups and our names spelled wrong, we would've gone to Starbucks, but we weren't looking for that type of atmosphere.  We wanted to take our time, talk, drink from a real ceramic cup, and enjoy our adult time away from the kids.  The music was great, the vibe was calm, mature, and peaceful.  I saw a few patrons enjoying a cup of coffee and reading a book; it's a great place for that.    We can't wait to return on another date night. the perfect latte ", pos 
Houndstooth Coffee ," 3/30/2016 My first visit to Houndstooth was delightful; it lives up to its reputation as one of the best coffee houses in Austin. The interior is clean, refined, and simple, as are their equipment and ceramics. The baristas were incredibly friendly and offered suggestions on different beans or blends for my espresso and cappuccino.  My espresso was brewed using Natalio Flores Ojeda, a single-origin Peruvian bean by Roseline. It had tangerine notes and was bright and pleasant. The milk chocolate flavors in the Hologram blend from Counter Culture Coffee paired well with the creamy milk in my cappuccino--just as the barista suggested it would.  All in all, one of the best coffee experiences I had in Austin. You won't be disappointed. ", pos

Houndstooth Coffee ," 9/7/2015 Houndstooth espresso makes my taste buds smile. I usually rotate between the cortado, latte, and cappuccino- all of which are excellent. The staff has a great attitude and is really talented with latte art that never fails to put a smile on my face. Houndstooth has limited space for studying, but is perfect for a quick drink or for togo.  I can't help but think that the placement of Tacodeli next to Houndstooth is more than a divine coincidence, but grabbing breakfast tacos and a cup of coffee has become a weekend routine for me.

The staff is always friendly and helpful, and they are patient when I'm taking a lifetime to decide on which coffee I want.

I try making it at home but some how it always seems to tast better at the coffee house.  I'm always in search of the perfect cup. The industrial decor alerts the consumer that Houndstooth takes their business seriously. The menu is small,  which isn't a bad thing if the product is exceptional. This place never fails to impress me. My cappacino was topped off with an adorable heart in the foam. The only issue I have is that the serving size of these cups of perfection are tiny. I honestly would need to order 3 to fulfill my desire for caffeine. (Don't judge me)  They also offer a small array of baked goods, they are tastey and seem to pair well with the coffee.

There is something to be said on the distinction of said distractions, but there definitely is such a thing as 'too distracting'.    This cafe' is the best thing that happened to me over the Summer. I love their clean decor - the focus being their coffee. They offer a distinct selection, not too vast, but then that's not the point is it? I got a great cup of beautifully brewed coffee. Simple.

Houndstooth Coffee ," 3/7/2015 1 check-in Listed in {AUSTIN}. Wonderful coffee shop!  FOOD AND DRINK: (4.5/5) I ordered a vanilla cortado, and I really, really enjoyed it. It was the perfect consistency, and the espresso + milk was smooth and delectable. Everything was wonderful. They also sold a small assortment of pastries if you're hungry, but honestly, the coffee was so great. Probably some of the best coffee I've ever had.  AMBIANCE AND SERVICE: (5/5) Wow, wonderful, wonderful, and wonderful. The baristas were extremely friendly and helpful; they were able to help my non-coffee-drinker friends figure out exactly what they wanted. When there wasn't a line at the counter, the two baristas were always working: wiping tables, sweeping the floors, cleaning the espresso machine, etc. This would definitely explain how everything was kept so clean and orderly, and made the whole experience more enjoyable.  The ambiance is very cozy. This is a pretty small coffee shop, but full of soft light and is very quiet. Plenty of outlets along the walls, so this would be a good place to bring your work and be super productive.  PARKING: (4/5) Houndstooth shares a lot with other stores in the same plaza (including Uchiko). Unfortunately, quite a few of the parking spots are designated ""10 minutes"" or ""30 minutes"", but there should still be plenty of spots remaining if you want to stay longer. I'm just thankful that we found a coffeeshop that wasn't limited to street parking at all.  COME AGAIN?: Yes, absolutely! If I wanted to get some work done, this is definitely the place I would go. However, I'm not sure if I would come here to hang out with a friend; it's a little quiet for my taste. But there are certainly benefits for that as well. Highly recommended! latte + vanilla cortado ", pos 
Houndstooth Coffee ," 6/4/2016 This is a great coffee shop. It's a little cramped inside, but still plenty of seating. They were offering Counter Culture and Tweed coffees the morning my wife and I went in. I was disappointed that the only drip offering was a blend. We ordered two pour overs: the Konga and Idido--both single origin coffees from Counter Culture. Definitely pricey for the size--almost $5 for a 16oz and they were not filled up all the way. I'm a snob, so I'll just say that both drinks were a little diluted (I've brewed a bag of the Idido at home so I know what it's supposed to taste like). Still very good coffee though. Cool vibe, very friendly and knowledgeable staff, good selection of pastries. I would definitely recommend. ", pos 
Houndstooth Coffee ," 7/27/2015 My favorite coffee! Wish houndstooth came to New York / California. The beans are amazing, and the baristas are friendly and knowledgable, very nice ambience, and right in between tacos and uchiko!! :) 10/10 would recommend Flat white for $4.25 ", pos 
Houndstooth Coffee ," 3/8/2016 Came here with my sister and since it was a bit late, we opted for green mint iced teas.

Well-lit, plenty of seating, fast wi-fi.  It seems like everyone here knows each other, or maybe everyone is just really frigging friendly, but it definitely feels like the neighborhood place where everyone knows your name. ", pos 
Houndstooth Coffee ," 11/16/2014 I had a lovely cappuccino there.  I am no coffee expert so I felt a bit overwhelmed immediately.  There was a line of people behind me so I just went the safe route.  It was a bit cramped while I was there presumably because many people had Veteran's Day off.  There was no place to sit and it made waiting a little awkward.  The gal at the register was really nice, the barista, more chilly, but he was hustling and put a lovely design in my foam.  That sounds so risqué. ", neutral 
Houndstooth Coffee ," 6/13/2015 Great coffee. Baristas are coffee geeks. The roasts that were on offer were not the generic kinds; some thought had gone into their selection. Good relaxing ambience. Music was not too loud. The latest issue of Barista magazine was on the counter. Latte art was cool. Parking is tight in this complex though. This is the only place I've had a drink they call a cortado. I enjoyed it very much, and the wife enjoyed her latte. Banana bread was good as well (large enough that it must be shared).

Houndstooth Coffee ," 9/27/2015 The drinks are good and I found the building clean and the staff friendly. I just can't give any more than three stars because the price doesn't seem worth it for the coffee.  Like a few other reviewers, I think I'm just not cool enough for Houndstooth. I think their espresso just tastes like... espresso... so why is it so expensive? Their drip coffees (which are what I really wanted) were actually too confusing for me to order. ", neutral

They're very consistent with their coffee every time and it's always on point.

They're very knowledgeable when it comes to coffee too!  It is a bit overpriced but I personally think it's worth the money.

Houndstooth Coffee ," 6/15/2015 Heard about Houndstooth while living in Hawaii. After moving to Austin, was able to finally try this place out while stopping by Taco Deli. I only tried the iced coffee without sugar/cream, it was perfect! Not too bitter or too watery. I'm very picky when it comes to coffee. I've started to step away from lattes, been wanting more of the coffee taste rather than milk.  Definitely coming back to try their other brewed coffees! ", pos 
Houndstooth Coffee ," 5/6/2014 I don't understand why people complain that this place is full of snobby baristas and hipsters. It's not.

If you don't understand the coffee offerings (I rarely do, I just go in with an idea of what I feel like drinking), they are glad to explain what things are to you. There is enough seating to satisfy the place on a non-busy day, which is good.

Walking into the place, you'll see those nice shiny espresso machines that'll make you want to quit your job and become a barista.  My favorite is the Iced Vanilla Latte. Watching them make it is amazing; you can tell it's good quality coffee when it takes a while to make.  I will admit that the drinks are pricey; it's always painful taking out my wallet here. But when you have coffee as good as theirs...how can you not get some?!  The place is pretty small and it gets crowded in the afternoons. If you're here to lounge around, I would say you have a 30% chance of getting a spot. It's good for grabbing a coffee to go with a friend though. ", pos

Houndstooth Coffee ," 9/9/2014 Some of the reviews written for Houndstooth is funny. A bad review because the barista was lacking a smile...or a certain roast for that day?  Anyhow.. both my experiences were quite pleasant. The cortados here really do live up to its name. The baristas are knowledgable such that if you present what kind of flavor you're looking for, they may suggest a certain roast for the drink you desire.  Over the past weekend's visit, I've tasted both its iced latte and a cortado. Great stuff. The barista there even suggested me to visit Figure-8 coffee in East Austin. Another great place. Love the atmosphere. Seems to be a cyclists' hangout over the weekend mornings. Great vibe. ", pos

Houndstooth Coffee ," 5/3/2015 First thing when I visit a city... find a place that serves good coffee. So, after looking at the reviews, I headed over to Houndstooth on the first day of a four day stay in Austin and ended up going back every day.  The pourover is done with a Clever filter which is a bit different than using a Chemex. Rather than pouring the water over and letting the coffee drip into the carafe, the water is steeped in the coffee grounds in the Clever. When it's done, the coffee then drains into a glass jar and then poured into the coffee cup. In my opinion, the coffee is a bit more robust than a simple pourover done with a Chemex  What Houndstooth does well is finding great coffee beans from some of the best roasters in the US - Counterculture, PT's, etc. I enjoyed some Amore de Dios (the love of God in Spanish) from CC and it was nothing short of amazing.  The only downside to Houndstooth are the pastries. We tried a couple of scones on the first day and they were just ok. But frankly, when you can head next door to Tacodeli, it's a huge win... great coffee and a breakfast taco!! ", pos

Houndstooth Coffee ," 5/13/2013 11 check-ins I love Houndstooth Coffee. The baristas have been consistently pleasant from my morning experiences, the rotating coffee specials are always great picks and yummy flavors, and they have a great house coffee. They DO offer cappuccinos, but this isn't really the place for those. Their prices are a little bit higher than some of the other places in town but I think the tastes are by far better.  Rotating coffee specials are on the left when approaching the register and their major notes are listed to make choosing easier. Same with espressos, which are served with a small glass of (I think) Topo Chico for cleansing the palette, according to my friend Helen.  It's definitely different from other ""coffeeshops"" in that I'm not sure I feel too comfortable studying here for extended periods of time--the word I would describe it with isn't exactly ""cozy.""  Warm even? No. Enjoyable and modern, but in the tiniest bit I'd compare it to Medici in terms of feel tables and chairs-wise. I'd say it's a Hudson, a Brannan, or maybe a Walden whereas some other coffeeshops would be something like Kelvin or Valencia. Yeah.. I went there. ", pos

Houndstooth Coffee ," 7/4/2014 I stumbled into this place this morning, looking for a delicious cappuccino to wake me up. Houndstooth didn't disappoint. They're a multi-roast coffee shop, so there are a few different bean options. I went with one called Koava for my cappo, and it was perfect. The right ratio of milk to espresso (aka not too much milk. Ahem, Starbucks), and a great machine that made the espresso the correct way (not burnt).  The people there were really friendly. The atmosphere was okay...not exactly a cozy place but nice enough. Pricing wise-a little steep. My cappo was 4.80. The coffee was great though so I'll come back again. ", pos

Houndstooth Coffee ," 12/7/2013 8 check-ins Listed in ATX Coffee Fix I'll preface this review by stating that I think I'm the odd one out on Houndstooth--I've never found the appeal of this place among my peers--please take no offense.  It's always hard to find parking here and the coffee shop is too small in my opinion--it probably seats a max of 25 people. It's a chore in itself to find a seat unless you like sitting outside during the wintertime. On another note, I've always felt awkward staying here as you could easily spot me from the crowd of hipsters at this place.  People come here for the coffee as the baristas know what they are doing but I also go to coffee shops to get work done and sadly the availability of electrical sockets at this place is zilch. The Internet speed is okay but not as quick as Monkey Nest's. Confession: sometimes I just order my coffee to go and work from Starbucks close by. ", neutral

Houndstooth Coffee ," 2/25/2014 1 check-in Before I begin my review, I just want to say that I am by no means a coffee connoisseur! Hand picked Colombian coffee house roasted and freshly ground vs instant coffee tastes basically the same to me. As a result I basically like my coffee 10% coffee, 40% milk, and 50% sugar. Therefore, I normally just drown any coffee given to me in copious amounts of sugar, honey, and sweetener (yay diabeetus).  BUT my experience at houndstooth was mucho different-o. I ordered a vanilla latte with Rustico espresso (i have no idea what that is but the friendly barista recommended it). Just as I was about to nuke it with sugar, I decided to give it a sip first. MMMMMMMMMMMMMM much taste, such good! Didn't even need sugar. I believe that's truly a testament to the quality of Houndstooth coffee. So far its the best quality coffee I have tried in Austin!  Other notes: This place is very cozy, but its a downright terrible place if you want to get work done. It's quite loud, has like zero outlets, and very few actual tables. Come here to chat and enjoy good coffee. Don't bother trying to study!  Overall: I loved the coffee, but I probably won't be a regular. $5.10 for a small cup of coffee is to luxurious for a poor college student D: ", pos

The baristas are nice and helpful, and there is enough light in the store for good Instagrams as well. There is a couch in one corner that is perfect for socializing or reading the newspaper, and bar seating as well as small tables perfect for your laptop. Honestly just a really pretty shop.

This coffee shop has very nice staff that answered all my question I had about their menu and is very knowledgeable when it comes to making a perfect coffee. In my case I asked for a latte, but I am sure they are perfect with every other coffee you can ask for. Even that I took my sweet time, they didn't want to hurry me as coffee takes it time and to choose the right one also can take a minute or two. You never want to go for the wrong one. The place itself has different tables and such and I sat down at a bar type table. The comfy ones were already taken and I didn't want to re-seat.  On a side note, they have some water ready to get it yourself, and reusable water cups, I like that. Together with the real cups this would give them an extra point but I can only give five points all together.  I will be back if I find parking in the area. ", pos

Being a nurse, coffee is my life blood, so I stopped by this hip little cafe and ordered up a latte.  I love that here, that doesn't mean an overly sweet confection like those chain places.  I do love a non-sweet hand pulled latte and this was a good one!  There is plenty of seating in the cafe and the decor is very urban industrial, think resto hardware, but lots of little pockets and alcoves for an intimate conversation.

Caffé Medici ," 6/26/2016 1 check-in This place is legit! Their coffee is amazing. I ordered an iced coffee which as simple as it sounds was incredible.  Yeah!

In the plaza with shake shack, high ball and at least four other restaurants. Lick ice cream right next door and smoothie place. ", pos 
Caffé Medici ," 5/23/2016 1 check-in I love Caffe Medici! I usually go to the location on Guadalupe across UT Austin, but I came here with my family for a late afternoon coffee since we were in the neighborhood. You get what you'd expect from Medici: friendly service, a modern-yet-cozy ambiance, and damn good coffee. I just got a normal drip coffee this time I went, and it well-outperforms its competitors even in this department. They really do use high quality coffees and brew with care; the product reflects it. My coffee (which I had black, no cream or sugar) was smooth, fruity, and hardly astringent whatsoever. I'm glad to see that no matter which location you go to, you can experience the same great product!  Also, while their store may not have the most seating, they make up for it with a generous amount of outdoor seating. And this is really a nice place to have outdoor seating; there are enough pedestrians and great, ""urban"" views. ", pos

Caffé Medici , 3/30/2016 1 check-in I have only been here once and it was a great experience. This place has a eclectic design to it. That meaning random mirrors and decor everywhere. Is that a bad thing? absolutely not. Now the coffee I got was an ice coffee but not just any ice coffee cold brew. OH but not just cold brew a concentrated one where milk is added and vanilla sweetener. So yes it put a pep in my step and it was really good to wash my smash burger down. I high recommend that kind of cold brew. They have a regular cold brew as well. I will be back if Im ever back in austin.  also apparently a great place to do computer work and homework. , pos 
Caffé Medici ," 2/29/2016 Great vibe, good coffee, great prices on the wines by the bottle as well.

This coffee shop has 3 things every coffee shop need: good coffee, fast Wifi, and great ambience. I was sold.  This location just opened and for a Monday evening, it was quite empty. The baristas were friendly and greeted us when we came in. I ordered what I usually get - an Iced Vanilla Latte. The prices are kind of steep, but my coffee was a perfect combination of espresso & milk, so I think it's quite worth.  I do wish they have more pastry options though~  Plenty of seats, outlets, and there's even a cute little patio outside!  You can park in the parking garage for Alamo Drafthouse.

Caffé Medici , 4/9/2016 I went here this morning with two of my daughters and my son-in-law for coffee and breakfast. We arrived at about 10 AM. They were down to their last three breakfast tacos. My daughter told me that they don't make the food there it is brought in from another vendor and they were simply very busy that morning and had sold out. We got the last of the tacos. So we also ordered some muffins and pastries. My taco was beans and pico de gallo. It was good but not as warm as I would like even though they heated up in the toaster oven. My blueberry muffin was dry and not very tasty. The coffee was good coffee. I just drink regular black coffee so I'm not into the exotics. The girls each had a chai latte which they thought was very good. My son-in-law have a cappuccino and he said that was good as well. All in all it was decent but not anything special. And of course being located in the Lemar union complex everything was a little pricey. It was a coffee shop. Not worth any extra time to travel there. The view of the river from our table Cubano was tasty but the ham was cold. Vegetarian sandwich with fries git a rave review from my daughter. , neutral 
Caffé Medici ," 3/26/2016 1 check-in They have a very small selection of drinks, plus some pastries and pre-wrapped sandwiches and snacks.

Caffé Medici ," 11/4/2015 1 check-in Listed in Give me coffee or give me death! I like this location more because it's near the Alamo Drafthouse, which is a great place to wait before the movie starts. Also you can go there after the film is over and hang out. There's also free parking which is a major plus. Medici is a fancy coffeehouse with modern furniture. In the middle of the coffeehouse is where the counter where the espresso machine is located and you can order your drinks. You have to go to the left part of the counter and you pick up your drink at the opposite counter. There are couches you can sit, tall tables, and there's outside patio sitting.

I have been to this store once and the service was great. I had only ever had their hot lattes and it was way too hot for that so I asked for recommendations for something cold and highly caffeinated. They gave me an iced toddy and it was perfect. Not too sweet, not too bland, and you could taste the strength. I finished it before I made it back to my apartment and then drank some of my friends'. Only thing I'll say, in typical American fashion, is larger sizes, plz?!!! Lol ", pos

Caffé Medici ," 7/31/2015 As I consider the vision that Cafe Medici holds, I continually find aspects of their business model that I appreciate. They don't need to have so many shops, in so many locations that necessitate high real estate premiums... yet they want to provide a common space for friends and family to gather in high-traffic areas in the city of Austin.  My friend and I considered their revenue-cost ratio and figured that this local institution could bankroll with one shop, charging a lot more in one location in which all of their efforts are directed. If you think about it, the coffee prices haven't changed much over the years... sometimes keeping things simple create the most convenience for the people in charge.  Yet, Medici provides the city with consistently good service, fair pricing, fantastic coffee... and quite the fiasco looking for parking in the vicinity of all 4 locations. I love what these guys are up to. ", pos

Flitch Coffee ," 11/25/2016 What a beautiful and fun hangout! Just a few quiet blocks away from home in my new neighbourhood, Flitch is a true gem. Knowing a LITTLE about east Austin, it felt a little off the beaten path and QUIET, which is perfect (who the hell wants to go to a noisy coffee shop...BEFORE you've had your coffee??). The little trailer is absolutely ADORABLE, and the fact that you actually go inside it to order is fun. Everything tastes fresh; it was also nice that I could get my latte made with almond milk. Yay! My favourite part was the outdoor seating area... dozens of tables, chairs, and benches, some shaded, made for a heavenly morning on a mild and sunny November day. Great way to wake up in a cheery mood. :) ", pos 
Flitch Coffee ," 10/30/2016 7 check-ins The coffee is excellent and I just love to hang out here. What more could you want? :)  The espresso drinks and cold brew are really delicious. And if you are looking for a sweet, delectable treat, get the iced latte with maple syrup in it! They also carry Tyson's tacos which is a big plus.  Erica the owner and usual barista is super friendly and makes great stuff. Her dog Jake is a super sweet pup that is always hanging out on the trailer's deck. Speaking of the trailer, what a beautifully outfitted thing. She found it on Craigslist and her boyfriend, now hubby (congrats y'all) of neighboring Hatch Workshop created a super cool, wood-paneled interior. I believe he also made the awesome furniture you can use outside.  The ginormous pecan tree that easily provides shade for the entire seating area is a huge perk. I love Tillery Street's greenery, which provides a wonderful backdrop for you to enjoy as you sip your drink. I can't wait to spend more time here, especially as it cools down more this Winter!

Flitch Coffee ," 9/28/2016 7 check-ins Such an adorable trailer tucked away in East Austin! I love this spot because it's quiet and peaceful and there is plenty of outdoor seating, good for a date or an outing with some girlfriends.  Their iced maple latte is probably the best flavored iced latte in Austin in my opinion. It has a light but sweet flavor that doesn't overpower the coffee. Their hot espresso drinks are also good.  Not to mention, the owner's dog is the cutest! Overall the vibes this trailer gives off and the great coffee they serve makes this a definite new favorite. They also give out free postcards! ", pos 
Flitch Coffee ," 5/10/2016 4 check-ins Listed in ""Nuptial Coffee Bliss!"" If you think it's tough following Austin's new restaurants, try keeping up with the coffee places. Flitch and Fleet are the newest local players, I think they're both great, and I'll meet you at either one. In fact, tell me which one you like, and I'll tell you what you are. Okay, I borrowed that line from a Starbucks in France.  I could tell you what beans they're using, but really, do you care? Trust Ms Foster's judgment. I benchmark places by their batch of straight black, but Flitch was out right before a Sunday closing, and I only had remnants from a late Tuesday morning one. But I did think my $2.50 Americano was some pretty good stuff. I know nothing about steamed milk or flavored concoctions.  I left here thinking what a clever use of a Spartan & tables, it's easy to park, and this area of Tillery street may be the last non-gentrified oasis in East Austin - hey, isn't that Jake Crane the Coffeedog? Flitch takes their coffee seriously, you'll feel welcomed here, and there's Topo Chico & WiFi. Total fanville for me. Flitch is located just south of the Tillery St Plant Co, where I thought it was going to be for some inexplicable reason. 3-4 people can sit inside the renovated Spartan, but think outside picnic tables if you're planning to hang. That's my cup, btw. ", pos

Flitch Coffee ," 7/1/2015 2 check-ins A short walk through a leafy green street in east Austin, yielded an unexpected coffee trailer in the large parking lot of a working hardware garage.  Misplaced next to an old gray cottage, with piles of fresh lumber stacked on metal tables, acting as sculpture, in this big concrete lot a quite serene tree shaded patio in the corner provided a sound meditative space for coffee and chat, as roosters crowed, ducks quacked in nearby neighbors yards, while soft sounds of construction parlayed in the back ground of this rapidly growing east austin neighborhood.  ""We're the only coffee shop this side of Pleasant Valley"", the poised pale and pretty smiling Chicago gal that wo-mans this trailer informed me as she poured my triple Americano in her simple but woodsy decor outfitted metal trailer.  I scored a strawberry pop tart from Luckys and found a cinder block to perch on for a cigarette away from the communal patio as locusts churred and birds chirped, and I sipped on a bright, acidic coffee that didn't quit taste like the full rich body of espresso but rather an excellently brewed coffee revealing a tasty bean.  The remoteness of the spot is in fact one of its high points, so come grab an easy cup from this 3 month young coffee trailer if you want to escape the brouhaha of funky east side.

There are lots of trees around and the street Flitch is on feels a lot older than a lot of other parts of town. I've only ever gotten my coffee to go but there is a little tiny space to sit inside the trailer, and lots of outdoor seating. Plenty of off street parking and some parking in the little lot they're in, too. They have tacos from Tyson's tacos and some baked goods, too.  If I enjoyed hanging out at coffee establishments I'd probably hang out here. ", pos 
Flitch Coffee ," 7/29/2016 Amazing coffee and a friendly Austin vibe make Flitch a must-go. Housed in a tastefully customized Airstream, you can choose to sip your yummy drink inside the lovely tiny-house-like trailer, or sprawled out under trees in the courtyard patio. It's located on the grounds of woodwork emporium Hatch, which means you sometimes get a peek at people making some very cool woodwork while walking up to the trailer. Park on Holton St for easy side access. And they have tacos in the morning too!! ", pos 
Flitch Coffee ," 9/30/2015 This is a magical little wonderland of what Austin should be about. Clean and sleek design that also draws you in to sit and relax- it reminds me of the Chelsea Highline in NYC. The trailer is so welcoming and homey without being informal, and I love that you walk inside to order. The owner is a spectacularly nice person, and it's a real treat to chat her up when I visit.  The real reason one goes back to a coffee place is of course, the coffee.  This is the ONLY place I know of in Texas to get a Maple Latté and I don't even have to bring my own maple syrup. Which I have done. So there. The espresso is rich and full but not bitter or acrid, the presentation is spot on. I love nothing more than a mapley, foamy, espresso-milk mustache, decorated with THE most perfect latte art.  My dog wants to put in his two cents:  ""Jake the dog is my friend. He works at this trailer too. We like to lie on the porch at Flitch and look at each other. Jake is nice. He smells like coffee and sunshine.""  I think that sums it up nicely. ", pos

I lost count of how much caffeine I have consumed so far today! Dead tired! Hungry af! Cranky from all of the above plus the disappointment of more misses than hits when it comes to my exploration for latte art in Austin so far. I was determined to change that after my last failed attempt looking for latte art. Plus I'm pretty delirious right now to give a fudge how many cup of coffee I have had today.  Yep, writing review for Medici while still sitting here sipping on the amazing almond milk cappuccino. I'm not drunk, just hyper, so you can still trust my words ;).  I wanted to jump seeing they offer STEVIA along with cane sugar, and brown sugar!!!! First coffee shop I have been to so far that has STEVIA option!!!!! They don't put any kind of sweetener in the latte, so I can adjust the sweet level to my liking!! Another huge point!!!  Little things matter a lot and always add up y'all!!!! They just made my night with great coffee, STEVIA, again, and the cutest/best touch complimentary tiny cookie that comes on the side with the cappuccino!!! It's delicious too!!!!  Parking is a lil pain in the ass, but just do neighborhood parking, don't park in any of the Laundry's parking spots next door or your car will get towed. Seating and coffee are definitely worth the little trouble!!!! Sugar! Brown sugar!! N STEVIA!!!!!!!!!!!!! YES!!!!!!! Delicious almond milk cappuccino!! Pretty latte art!!!! Finally!!!! ", pos 
Caffe Medici ," 7/10/2016 Great coffee in a warm, inviting atmosphere.  Okay, so I'm a little biased because I can walk here, plus I had my first date with the love of my life here, BUT for real, they make some damn good coffee drinks. These guys know their coffee, and will create your perfect beverage. The small, cozy cottage (Medici's first location) is a great place to spend a leisurely morning reading the newspaper and enjoying conversation with your squad. They have Taco Deli tacos (who doesn't these days?) and local pastries. And for all you vegans out there, they use the GOOD almond milk. Keep an ear out for your drink because this isn't Starbucks (thank goodness) and they don't take names.  This place is my go to for coffee and is worth the drive if you're not from the 'hood.

Stopped by this location because I was already in the neighborhood and decided to check it out instead of driving to my usual coffee shop - and I'm so glad I did.  This might just be the quaintest coffee shop I've been! It's like that cottage you dream of moving to one day but cannot for reasons like.. life. But now you can! Sort of. Okay you don't get the cottage to yourself, but it's so peaceful that it felt like so.  I was lucky enough to grab a window seat (there're prob only 2 desks that don't get a window view) and enjoyed the serene view of rainy Austin when I needed a break from work. Everyone around me seemed to be enthralled in their work as well (they may be checking Fb but looked real professional even so), so it's conducive to work.  This location is unique in that it's definitely Austin-y, but without going overboard (remember those uncomfortable but cool-looking furniture from that one shop? Or two?) So why only 4 stars? I'd give 10 stars for ambience! But held back by Yelp's 5 star system and their espresso. As it's a coffee shop, the final rating should be about the coffee. And 4 stars keep away the crowd away, right? ;P Cappuccino ", pos

Caffe Medici ," 11/8/2015 3 check-ins Gold standard cappuccino.  There isn't a place in Austin that serves a better cappuccino than Medici. Solid. I almost never order 2 when I'm working from a coffee shop ... except when I'm at Medici. Really sweet folks who work the bar. It's pretty packed throughout the day, but around 4:30, starts clearing out. Great little patio and lots of folks hang out there and work. At one point in my workday, I peer out the window and see a woman....with her very large per iguana perched on her table. You know. A lizard has got to get their people watch on too. I like the music. It's not obnoxious, it's not too loud. Yeah....that happened. Keep Austin weird y'all. ", pos 
Caffe Medici ," 6/20/2016 Super cute coffee shop built inside a older home, Cafe Medici is small, well lit and comfortable. I'm a big fan of sofa's in coffee shops- and this one has one that we kept our eye on for a while till it was free. For a small place it was still a relaxing spot to sit and read on a Sunday morning. The coffee was strong and tasty. Some outdoor seating for those that can deal with Austin heat. Worth a try for sure! ", pos 
Caffe Medici ," 7/30/2016 1 check-in Immensely enjoyed my morning at Medici's--an outstanding cup of black coffee, a delightful cappuccino, great atmosphere, and friendly service. Medici's accommodated the morning work-out crowd, the easy-Saturday-morning folks on their laptops or with their books, and little tots and their precious parents. Teamed with a friendly smile from the staff and melodious coffee, it made for a very pleasant morning. Get your coffee fix at Medici's! Delightful Medici cappuccino. ", pos 
Caffe Medici ," 1/13/2016 Cool, quiet, cute coffee shop with very good coffee and good wifi.  You can sit inside or outside.  Inside, there are a variety of tables to sit at, as well as a comfy couch.  The decor has lots of dark wood.  They have various pastries and other foods for sale, which looked good, but which I didn't get to try.  They also have self-service water which is convenient.  They have a parking lot, but it's not big and can get packed.  So walk or ride your bike here, if you can. ", pos 
Caffe Medici ," 10/5/2016 Here's the deal. I love Medici. The owner is a super nice guy from my hometown and I've had some really great drinks from here. This time is no different. The mocha and the black coffee were both great. I'm just really disappointed with the customer service. We walked up to the counter and the woman at the register just looked at us waiting for our order. Maybe I'm just spoiled or I expect too much, but I like to have a little friendly exchange and not just walk up and bark my order at someone. Maybe that's what she is used to, and if that's the case that is sad. She seemed to want us to just order and get out of the way and she didn't actually listen to my order, which I realized when it came out wrong. No biggy, it happens and the barista was quick to fix it. Just...come on you guys. You're better than that. ", neutral

Caffe Medici ," 4/13/2016 Absolutely love this place. I come here all the time with my wife to pick up our routine coffee and tacos. I was especially impressed with their service yesterday. We ran out of coffee at home and I wanted to bring home a bag of their beans (La Famiglia). Unfortunately, the only bags they had were too large, but the barista happily opened one and made me a smaller, 16 oz bag. He then gave us one of our coffees for free, and also ground the beans for me (I have a hand-grinder at home, so that can be pretty tedious).  Didn't even mention their coffee, but it is INCREDIBLE. The Medici folks know how to make fantastic espresso. ", pos 
Caffe Medici , 5/8/2016 Terrible coffee. Absolutely the worst cup of coffee I have ever purchased at a coffee shop. The cup of coffee I got from here yesterday was not good but the cup today far exceeds the crappiness of yesterday's coffee.  Follow-up:  Went in the next day and talked with the barista. They were very nice and helpful. I've come to the conclusion that I don't like their drip coffee , neutral 
Caffe Medici ," 9/30/2015 This was the best cup of coffee I've had made for me in about 6 months, but only because I don't remember any coffee experiences prior to 6 months. So it's quite possible this could be a ""best cup of coffee ever"" scenario and I just don't know any better. So we'll give it 5 stars and adjust every 6 months, cool?  I don't think I've had any head trauma, I just don't remember. So if it isn't the best cup you've had in 7 months, I apologize for this claim, but I've made it pretty clear there's no coffee memory before the 6 month mark.  You know what, I'm going to take a star away due to how uncomfortable I felt hovering by someone's table while I was standing in line. There really is no good way to stand in a line of 4 or more people considering how congested this spot can get (remember, best coffee within 6 months of coffee brain history). I mean, there was someone trying to eat a croissant and I was practically looming over them. You can't enjoy a croissant that way! I mean, I guess you could, but probably not in this context.  Despite the poor line traffic pattern, the spot felt calm for how many people were in here. It was just a light hum of human activity, no boisterous people were present today. Except outside. Where there's lots of seating. I sat on a rock bench. It was nice.  Except for the guy talking about how to make aioli or some sort of special mayonnaise; he was the worst. But everything else was nice. ", pos

Caffe Medici ," 3/1/2016 I haven't tasted a better cup of mocha in town yet, and this town has some amazing coffee shops. The parking can be horrible, but that's because it's tucked away in the heart of downtown Austin. The atmosphere is great, always compelling art on the walls, and the baristas have always been great. I highly recommend the mocha- it's sinfully decadent. The caramel is made in house so the caramel latte is beyond tasty. I'm a classic latte kinda girl though, and it never fails to be divine. The limited space makes it very cozy, inside and out. Lots of people working, chatting, and kicking back in an old house. I have yet to try their other locations, but I am eager to!

Caffe Medici ," 1/1/2016 Nice little coffee shop that we hit on our way to the Longhorn Caverns. The latte was smooth and tasty. I would return here if in the area.  It doesn't compare to the coffees in San Francisco, but I haven't found anything that does yet. Sorry for the snobby SF comment, I can't help but compare. ", pos 
Caffe Medici ," 11/10/2015 Just another cute coffee shop tucked away in the heart of downtown Austin.  I came here on a Friday night and there was plenty of seating.  Unfortunately, there were not many pastries available.  I had a hot cup of tea and my brother had some decaf iced coffee, which he enjoyed.  Service was great.  Quiet spot to study. ", pos 
Caffe Medici ," 3/23/2015 The atmosphere is great and the service is really nice. Honestly the only reason for the three stars in the cost. I'm not saying it isn't worth it, I'm just saying that it is hard to justify the fact that even a small cup of coffee with nothing special approaches $3.  There are many great Coffee options in Austin, and this is one of them, just know that the cost is high before you go. ", neutral 
Caffe Medici ," 1/17/2016 There are a lot of reasons to love, Austin, TX.  Great coffee & amazing people are some of them. Find them here at Caffe Medici in Clarksville.

Thanks for the Cheese Danishes. Thank you. ", pos 
Caffe Medici ," 1/2/2016 Good cup of coffee (a bit pricey). Very nice vibe. Limited seating in close quarters, so other people's conversations were a butt distracting. Neat spot. ", pos 
Caffe Medici ," 1/23/2015 10 check-ins I wish I could give this place 4.5 stars, but I'll be nice and give it a full 5 stars. I would only dock .5 stars due to the limited space both in terms of parking and available tables inside.  I definitely prefer this location over that on Guadalupe. There are not as many UT students, which I prefer. I'm not a big fan of coffee shops filled with UT students who are ""studying."" The coffee itself is definitely one of the best I've had in Austin. It's tough to say which is the best when you have other coffee shops like Houndstooth and Patika. However, I always decide to come to Cafe Medici simply because it's the closest to where I live.  Like I said earlier, there's seating available but not nearly as much as those available at the Medici on Guadalupe. However, if you come at the right time, you should be able to find an open table.  If you're visiting Austin or looking for a new coffee shop to check out, I'd definitely recommend coming by this place because the coffee is just always on point. ", pos 
Caffe Medici , 5/31/2016 Outside of Italy one of the best cappuccinos I've had. I haven't had any other drinks because it's so good so it's what I always get. , pos

Caffe Medici ," 11/7/2015 I ordered a 12oz drip, 16oz Americano, and toasted bagel. The tab came to $9-and-change, which I thought was a bit high. However, I took a sip and both coffees were among the richest, most delicious I've ever had! You can really taste the beans. My wife preferred the Americano and thought the drip was too acidic, but I was a fan of both. It's truly coffee, not the ""coffee-flavored drink"" pawned off as coffee by many shops.  Parking is tight. There is free wifi and ample seating. ", pos 
Caffe Medici , 3/24/2016 Good place and lots of room to study. My only complaint is I don't like the food options they have there very much. The coffee is good though. , pos 
Caffe Medici ," 9/16/2014 I spent Sunday morning on the porch of Caffé Medici getting to know a new friend and it was a lovely experience. The shop is in an old house. It really does a good job of making you feel like you're hanging out in a cozy living room surrounded by 15 of your closest study buddies. The front porch is a lovely addition; it's on a quiet street (or at least, Sunday mornings are quiet) but it's a nice break to hang out on the porch with a cup of coffee and watch the people stroll by.  The café uses Cuvee coffee. I wasn't familiar with that roasting company before coming to Austin, but it's everywhere around here! My cappuccino was good. A little too much milk for my personal taste, but still nowhere near the massive cups of milk with a shot that some companies try to pass off with that name (ahem, Starbucks). Ordering was easy to do and the baristas were very pleasant. All in all, it was another great coffee shop experience! ", pos 
Caffe Medici , 3/7/2016 Whenever I'm in the mood for a high quality espresso drink I know I can come here and get one. Their equipment is top of the line and their coffee beans are excellent. The location in old enfield is such a great community spot and they do a great job of handling large lines quickly without compromising quality. Love the fact that it's dog friendly! , pos 
Caffe Medici ," 7/13/2016 I liked this place. Not love, but liked. Parking was a pain but once I got inside the interior is pleasant and warm, even if the decor isn't my personal preference. I ordered an iced almond milk latte (the same drink I get at every single coffee shop I go to for the first time, to gauge then against each other) and it was alright. I liked their crushed iced and the almond milk was nice and creamy, although I wish the coffee would have come through a bit stronger - I could've used an extra shot. The atmosphere was nice, as its in a renovated old home, making it feel very welcoming. My two biggest reasons it didn't get 4 stars: the music they were playing happened to be a fiddler or some type of instrument that, without even being particularly loud, seemed to cut through my headphones no matter how loud I turned my own music. Didn't love that. Secondly, I thought that the $5.10 price for my latte was a bit steep- I get it, it's Austin, but I've had better almond milk lattes for slightly cheaper elsewhere. Even knocking 25¢ off would've made it seem more reasonable & comparable. Overall, I'd come again if I was in the area and wanted some coffee. ", neutral 
Caffe Medici ," 5/21/2014 2 check-ins I easily think that this Medici is the best location. It's easy to get to (as opposed to having to find street parking downtown or near campus), and has such a different feel than the others. Less students than the campus location, more residential locals, but all locations are pretty laidback.  This is the only location without two stories, but the pro of this one is the quaint seating on stone furniture in the front and the small patio space with a doggie bowl. The space is a repurposed home (well... you're in Austin) with great wifi, a great mixed crowd, closely spaced tables, and a feel of a friend's home or the neighborhood coffeeshop.  Even though this location has a lot, it's fairly small and often a time I've had to find parking elsewhere and walk over. This particular location is in a pretty hip part of that neighborhood, and there's always people biking by or walking their dogs outside. Oh yeah, the coffee is great too, and the baristas friendly. ", pos 
Caffe Medici ," 9/20/2014 1 check-in This one is okay. Not as good as the one on congress. Nice perks are patio seating, private parking and lots of outlets. Traditional toddy's and such. But, if you ask anyone local they will tell you the one on congress is better. Cortado with millk ", neutral 
Caffe Medici ," 8/27/2015 This is one of my favorite places to get an espresso in all of Austin! I haven't been to the new location on south lamar (right down the street from me), yet but I will soon. I LOVE the tiny spoons that they serve with the espresso, and of course the tiny biscotti that comes with it is delicious and I could eat ten million of them.

Caffe Medici ," 3/29/2014 1 check-in Stopped by while in town for SXSW. Was concerned about some of the comments but in my constant quest for good coffee I decided not to be deterred.  Since it was breakfast time, I went with the cappuccino and a berry muffin. Both were delicious. The place was busy but had no troubles finding a place to sit. Yeah, they don't have the most comfortable furniture but I don't understand why some people think buying a cup of coffee gives you the right to sit there and work all day as if it was your office.  I would give this place 4.5 stars only since they don't offer pour over goodness. Cappuccino and berry muffin ", pos 
Caffe Medici ," 11/23/2015 Great place to kick back and grab a coffee, especially late at night. Cozy atmosphere and it's pretty quiet (due to the people studying).

Oh well, I'll visit again tho! ", neutral 
Caffe Medici ," 4/8/2014 1 check-in Service was courteous & they keep the espresso machine moving (or did so on our Friday morning visit).  Place is full of the usual Austin-mix (i.e., a little bit of everything).    Had a simple latte, my stable.  Though spoiled by our Tulsa-wonder-of-theworld (yelp.com/biz/doubleshot-…), I found it a capable, albeit bland latte.  Espresso had a balanced friendliness; it was lacking in the sweet part of the draw that I so love at my DS.    For reference, I no longer flavor syrup any espresso drink, at least so long as I can help it. If not engrossed in conversation, I would have headed back up to pay my $.50 or whatever to add a shot of something.  Like the environment, found it a capable cup.  Would return if ever back in this part of W 6th. ", neutral 
Caffe Medici ," 1/18/2014 3 check-ins I cannot stop talking about the coffee here. Seriously, the best in town.  They make their own caramel syrup and every time I get a caramel latte and it's the best damn cup of coffee. Not too sweet like some places, just the right hint of caramel syrup, clean creamy coffee goodness. And they always put a pretty design on the foam.  These people know what they are doing and you cannot go wrong getting a cup of any type of coffee here. Plus, they carry Rockstar bagels and some really good other pastries and the like. EVERYONE I have ever met is awesome and friendly and I've had some really cool conversations while waiting for my coffee. Favorite coffee shop. Wish they had one up North by where I live. ", pos 
Caffe Medici ," 5/1/2016 We have been big fans of Caffe Medici since they opened on West Lynn in '06. Although we've tried many other beans we always come back to the Medici Blend aka La Familigia. I cannot tell you how disappointed I was this past Friday to find out Cuvee and Caffe Medici have parted ways and La Famiglia is no longer available. We took a small bag of their new beans, the Spyhouse Orion's Blend. Although the barista assured me the blend was similar to La Famiglia neither my husband nor I agree. It is nothing close and not nearly as good. We are both very disappointed that Caffe Medici's newest house beans are not going to be a staple at our house. We're now on the search for a good replacement. :( ", neutral 
Caffe Medici ," 3/22/2015 Great single origin coffee from many places, try a new one everytime you go. The servers are friendly and nice.

Caffe Medici ," 1/4/2015 My husband and I decided to check out this place based on previous yelp reviews. We recently returned from Italy and it completely ruined us for drinking coffee out. I had high hopes for Caffe Medici because a friend had also told me she thought it was the best place in Austin.  The baristas did not disappoint. The place was packed and you could tell the orders were coming in as fast as those ladies could fill them, however, even being that swamped, they still took the time to make sure the quality of the drink was not compromised. In addition, they took the time to put some beautiful latte art on the drinks.  I ordered a cappuccino and my husband got a latte. I took my first sip and holy crap, it was strong and smooth! Yes! And just like that I found a little piece of Italy here in Austin, Texas. Thank you Caffee Medici. I'll be back! ", pos

I ordered a skinny vanilla latte with honey and the man taking my order was like, ""the honey is over there."" I'm thinking to myself, ""but the honey needs to go with the espresso before it's mixed with the milk so that it can melt..."" Anyways, not wanting to be much of a nag I just got the honey and waited. The barista was very sweet. Put the honey in for me but unfortunately they put the espresso right into the milk and the honey ended up along the sides of my cup. Also, the coffee tasted kind of uncomfortably creamy/milky. Not positive they used skim milk. Altogether, will probably frequent other coffee shops before returning here. ", neutral

I don't really see the need for five stars because the coffee is pretty average and the treats are a bit a lacking in variety. It would also be nice if they had some additional non-coffee options.

Caffe Medici ," 1/22/2012 Updated review Listed in Keep Austin Caffeinated I wanted to write a funny review about Cafe Medici, but, unfortunately, there is nothing funny about espresso. This is serious espresso made by serious baristas.  You think I'm kidding? Well, you try drinking a bottle of wine after a long day in a cubicle. Then, have your young children wake you up at 6:30 a.m. Guess what? They don't care about hangovers. All they care about is chocolate milk and Iron Man.  It's not pretty, folks. Orange juice won't cut through the fog. English breakfast tea won't drive away that headache and give you a fighting chance.  Sure, you could pop into your neighborhood Starbucks and have some middling coffee made by people more interested in blasting out Caramel Mocha-Fattacinos and upselling freaking Via to keep the a-holes in Corporate off their backs.  Why not come out firing? Take your life back. Go to Cafe Medici, somehow park in that ludicrously small lot, and order some seriously good espresso made by someone who knows more about coffee than any sane person should. ", pos 
Caffe Medici ," 3/10/2015 Best coffee + vibes in Austin. Their treats are really classy too. Everyone there is nice and its usually pretty good for reading or hamming around with a friend. When its raining or cold, it can get crowded, since the outside seating is not an option. ", pos 
Caffe Medici ," 2/1/2015 Great coffee, pricing comparable to other coffee shops. They were packed on the Saturday afternoon I was there, so it's not completely fair to evaluate the wait time I had for my coffee. I'll eat there and reevaluate later. ", pos 
Caffe Medici ," 6/25/2013 1 check-in Don't know if it's like this all the time but for what I came to do today, Caffe Medici is hitting the spot.  Before I get down to the nitty-gritty, here's my frame of reference and some context: it's a Wednesday and I came with the intent to write on my laptop with minimal need for wifi. Time spent spanned late morning and early afternoon.  Great location - neither at a crossroads nor in no man's land.  Music is non-obtrusive (not too loud, no emo. Think pre-Jack Johnson Jack Johnson, Hawaii jam band without the jam, margaritaville without the margaritas...) Customers are self-contained and quiet.  Space - perfectly middle-of-the-road, nonextreme in size and neither empty nor overcrowded. There were several open spots when I got there, all readily accessible. I chose the last open two-top at the front and sat on the bench under the window, which provides seating for two other two-tops. Though both tables were occupied by patrons who also sat bench-side, there was still ample space for both me and my stuff to fit on the bench alongside them. To boot, where I sat at the end closest to the corner, I was able to plug in to charge without a hitch.  Staff is super nice. when I got here a little before noon, when they were about to get rid of the remaining breakfast tacos and they threw me two on the house. For this I'd give the place 6 stars if I could.  Overall, I'd recommend this place for caffeinated independent work, whether it be laptop or reading. ", pos 
Caffe Medici ," 11/19/2013 Parking is a problem but the damn good drinks are worth it.  I love the small house and the tucked away feeling you get when you sit in the corner.  The baristas are friendly, fast, and make a gorgoeus drink.  Bring your pup and sit on the front porch or bring a good book (you know, the paper that's bound and has words) and enjoy the upscale homey feel of the inside. ", pos 
Caffe Medici ," 11/7/2014 This place is definitely my favorite branch out of the three caffe medicis in Austin. I love how cozy it is and how it is in a semi-residential neighborhood. It's a great place to get some work done because it doesn't get too loud. There is a lot of foot traffic on the weekends and it's pretty hard to get a table so you have to stake out for a bit, but the coffee makes it all worth it. I always get their cappuccinos! ", pos 
Caffe Medici ," 10/20/2014 Great atmosphere, fantastic coffee, Taco deli breakfast tacos, local pastries, good music.  I can't really say anything bad about Cafe Medici! Love this place. ", pos 
Caffe Medici ," 7/19/2011 Listed in Austin Awesome little neighborhood coffee shop that's frequented by the locals, including  a good coffee-drinking friend of mine.  I'm not a coffee drinker but I love the smell of coffee wafting throughout that shop.  You definitely gotta try their sausage rolls!  Just pure goodness! It goes great with a glass bottle of Coke.  Also, if you're in the mood for a breakfast taco or two, be sure to get there early in the morning cuz they sell out fast!  I definitely love the outdoor seating and tables made out of large rocks.  The staff were friendly.  Got to meet the owner and his family.  They're just an adorable family!  Want to feel belonged?  You'll definitely feel welcomed here! ", pos 
Caffe Medici ," 4/25/2014 1 check-in Cool atmosphere in a cute/retro part of town. Good luck finding parking though. There are 3 (maybe 4 if you have a smart car) tiny parking spots behind the cafe. All other surrounding parking is associated with other businesses & brandishes towing signs, so just meander into the neighborhood. At least the houses there are fun to see. ", pos 
Caffe Medici ," 11/14/2014 1 check-in Very nice place. Limited parking indeed (maybe 10 spots total), but it was worth finding parking on the street. The Cappuccino was delicious! excellent brew. The atmosphere was airy and plenty of natural light. There are small two-seater tables scattered, a couch with a bench, and some outside seating. Overall, a great shop. ", pos 
Caffe Medici ," 9/3/2013 Friendly coffee spot, great location and good coffee.  I've been on a quest to find a decent passable flat white in Austin. The folks at Caffe Medici knocked it out of the park.  Highly recommended. ", pos 
Caffe Medici ," 2/6/2011 Because I love coffee and everything about it, I've set out on an unofficial quest to try every coffee house in Austin and the surrounding area.  I finally tried Caffé Medici. I wanted to know what all the fuss was about. I'm kind of picky about my coffee and I am not easily influenced by what others say, however, my taste buds say this place really lives up to its reputation.  The lattes are smooth and bold at the same time - bold enough to grow hair on your chest if you get your coffee full on leaded. (I sometimes like to order de-caf....of the ""why bother"" variety).  If you don't want milk in your latte, they offer soy as an alternative. They swirl lovely art on top of the lattes for you. The lattes are prepared quickly. They also happen to offer pre-packaged gluten-free cookies in their pastry case, which I didn't try on this visit.  It's an old house. There are unique seats out front made of stone with wood planks drilled in. The atmosphere is pleasant and the staff is nice. You can find a bookshelf with books, magazines and games, or you can enjoy burying yourself in your laptop.....a little something for everyone it seems.  Cool place, great coffee. ", pos 
Caffe Medici ," 2/15/2015 The coffee here is insatiable. Two locations that I am aware of in Austin, but the West Lynn is my preference. ", pos 
Caffe Medici , 9/6/2014 Updated review Got almond milk! Coffee is awesome and dp now taco deli.  Yummy.  My only gripe is parking.  Otherwise super cool and nice employees. , pos 
Caffe Medici ," 5/27/2013 1 check-in Yeah yeah so I speak Starbucks and was schooled on what a real macchiato actually was. (Not the cold iced Caramel deliciousness that one might think)  So I was instructed that what I  actually wanted was an iced latte with Caramel. I was informed that the Caramel was made in house. I tasted little to NO Caramel in my drink. So I can not comment on how the Caramel actually was. They don't drizzle it in the glass or on top.  It was pretty good but not better than my beloved chain.  We ordered two of these beverages along with 2 chocolate croissants for a whopping total of $16. SAY WHAT?!  I don't live in ATX so I might not be back to this place.  Our Barista was really nice, I was just always feel so uncool whenever I go into a coffee shop in Austin. They have a way of making you feel so ignorant. ", neutral 
Caffe Medici ," 12/13/2010 PARKING SUCKS!!  You have been warned.  They share a VERY small parking lot with the laundry mat next door and other places around the coffee shop have ""No Coffeshop Parking Allowed"" - so if you go good luck trying to find a place to park and hope you don't get towed which thank goodness didn't happen to me or anyone in my meetup group.  Only reason I gave them 3 stars is because the prices are affordable and the coffee and peanut butter cookie were good but other than that this place would have gotten 2 stars.  This place is not good for groups in less you are with a knitty group and only have like 4 people with you.  Some of the staff members were nice but the one making the coffee was a tad bit ""grumpy and crabby"" and should have stayed home.  I don't plan on ever returning - sorry Caffe Medici!! ", neutral 
Caffe Medici ," 6/27/2013 Probably my favorite Medici location.  Smaller, cozier, and really laid back. Love the location in Clarksville, and I appreciate the ""neighborhood café"" feel that you get here.  The baristas are great about remembering your name and they're always really friendly. A lot of Austin baristas can be really pretentious and/or standoffish. Anywhere with amiable baristas is a breath of fresh air in the ATX specialty coffee scene.  Coffee is quality here, and that quality is consistent. Medici (all 3 locations) does an excellent job training their staff to deliver excellent espresso beverages over and over again. If you're looking for traditional espresso beverages, this is a great place to go. Some of the best in Austin!  It can get a little crowded here, and parking can be hard to find in the small lot. If the lot is full, be prepared to park across the road, or in the neighborhood just east of the shop. During busy times, you might have to wait for a table, or look outside. There are some great tables in front of the shop, but they are usually in direct sun, and can be unpleasant in the Texas heat. ", pos 
Caffe Medici ," 3/6/2013 Drinks good. Baristas chill. My only suggestion is that the wall decor is pretty sparse. For Westlynn, I'd expect more liberal use of the wall space...  It'd be nice to read/see a bit more of the history of the building or of the Medici business.  Yes, there is photography posted, but there is a lot of blank canvas space with the walls, why not use the space to tell me a story?  Just a thought--people clearly come for the coffee, but they'd come back for a connection, so why not create it whenever and wherever possible? ", pos 
Caffe Medici ," 6/27/2014 The coffee here was not to my taste. The cafe au lait came at an excellent temperature,  but I like my coffee slightly stronger-- too bland. ", neutral 
Caffe Medici ," 8/30/2014 After coming here a number of times, I figured it was time to finally review this place. Of the two Medici locations I've been to in Austin, I like this one the most. It's some sort of refurbished home in a small, residential area. They tend to be crowded inside but only because it is a small place. To counter that, they have neat stone chairs outside that are always available. I've never had a bad drink here and have never had any issue with the staff, though I also never order anything particularly fancy or difficult. Can't review the food since I've never eaten it. ", pos 
Caffe Medici ," 7/7/2014 1 check-in Coffee is awesome, the breakfast tacos are OK.  I've had their mocha latte, soy cappuccino, and iced coffee. All drinks were fantastic.  I came here for some food and was not impressed. Besides the fact that the tin foil wrapped taco almost gave me a 3rd degree burn (they must keep these hot over boiling water or something like that), when I finally opened it the taco was kind of congealed. The flavor wasn't bad but I wouldn't order one again.  Go here for coffee, not breakfast, and you can't go wrong! ", neutral 
Caffe Medici ," 5/30/2014 This is definitely my favorite place in Austin to grab some coffee. Great atmosphere and superb coffee, perfect for quick business meetings and perhaps a first date :) I highly recommend it! ", pos 
Caffe Medici ," 1/14/2013 My sister has evolved into a coffee aficionado.  I mean, she has spent many years in Austria, travelled and lived all throughout Europe and has this 900 dollar espresso machine at home that she and her husband make coffee from.  When she talks about drinking coffee, she uses a vocabulary that lets you know she has drunk a lot of coffee in her time.    Before she became so good at knowing great coffee, I brought her to Caffe Medici and she fell in love with it.  This was about 6-7 years ago.  Last year, after she was talking about more of her coffee drinking exploits, I asked her where Caffe Medici now ranks in her global experience of drinking coffee.  She said, ""Hmm, that's a tough question.  I think I still have to either put them at the top or at least the top 2-3 coffee shops I've ever been to.  My mom also likes to drink coffee.  She is this crotchedy ol' woman who can lose her temper quickly.  She visited my house from Florida one day and was upset when she woke up and realized I didn't have any coffee.  ""TAKE ME TO STARBUCKS!"", she bellowed out.  So, we loaded up in the car and headed out.    However, I wasn't taking her to Starbucks.  Since there is a Starbucks on every corner, she soon grew weary of our journey and so sweetly said, ""Where in the Hell are you taking me!"".  I told her that I was taking her to the best coffee shop in Austin to which she started ranting about leaving her alone and simply letting her drink the same Starbucks coffee she has drunk all these years.  ""What are you doing?  This is ridiculous! "", she continued on.    By the time we got in line to order (the Clarksville location), her demeanor reflected a mix of frustration at not getting her Starbucks as well as withdrawls from not having any coffee at all in her system.  She orders the Hunapu, straight black and we sat down so she could have a drink.  The last thing I remember her saying was,  ""I just wanted my Starbucks coffee and you bring me all the way down here to this house....Sip (Pause)...Oh damn, this is good"".  Mark ", pos 
Caffe Medici ," 2/19/2010 1 check-in Italian sodas, great kitsch and sugarcane coca cola.  Folks here are really friendly  -- looks like its more of the working crowd and the casual conversations happen pretty organically from one table to another.    Great wifi, with adequate pluggage and a great use of the space.  I wish they had delicious diet coke but their coffee selection looked extensive and I think they've got the mix down right on non coffee to coffee drink ration. ", pos

Caffe Medici ," 8/4/2012 Caffe Medici makes real coffee. Drip, french press, espresso (not ex-pres-o) etc....  I love the macchiato's. I'm not talking about Starbucks version either because that's a joke. This is as it should be, was made to be and is done correctly at Medici. Two shots, a small amount of milk and some foam. Quick fast in a hurry and out the door. That's how I do it at Medici. Mostly because there is no seating and everyone is camped out bumming the free wifi. Really? It's Clarksville I know you people can afford the internet.  Oh and watch your step here. What is it with people always spilling their water? I swear I've seen it happen more times that not at this location. I guess its the caffeine or lack there of jitters. ", pos 
Caffe Medici ," 10/11/2012 I have a fancy-assed very expensive Italian espresso machine at home with a fancy-assed burr grinder. I buy fancy-assed whole coffee beans, or sometimes roast them myself.  I rarely go out for coffee.  But if I have to, this is the only place I will go. The coffee tastes like real coffee, real espresso, real cappucinos... and by real I mean not some corporate-quality-controlled-likely with additives-starf*cks coffee. It's comparable to good coffee in San Francisco or Seattle.  If you've been afraid of real espresso for fear it will be bitter, sour or just unpalatable, try it here.  The parking can suck.I've never tried the food. They have water bowls for your doggies.  Some staff are nice; some seem to have Asperger's. I see complaints about lack of comfy chairs, but I go for the coffee, not the chairs (profound, huh?)  They will serve you in a real cup too. That's a weird statement, but I'm tired of getting paper/throw-away take out cups when I want to sit and linger with a good cup. I feel like I'm a McDonald's when I get served coffee in a paper cup.

Caffe Medici ," 12/29/2013 1 check-in Listed in Coffee Shop Adventure Cute little craftsman house, which adds to the ambiance.  Location is close to downtown but without the horrible parking issues... Just normal parking shortage, as is common for most trendy urban haunts. The espresso was a little bitter to me, but not burnt tasting. Day-old pastries  (from Quacks!!) are $1.   I put off coming here because every time I search for coffee an ad pops up, which seems to defeat the purpose of Yelp reviews & makes me wonder why they lean on advertising vs. word of mouth.  You can get real food, and they have all of the random not-cow milks.seems like a better place to meet a friend to chat than find a comfy spot to hang out. ", pos

Thank you!  I stopped by this place on the way back from a run in the morning. I had two things on my agenda - get some coffee and pick up a cute souvenir to bring back home.. this place had both! The gentleman who worked there was so nice and gave me recommendations on what I should bring home. Plus, the check-in offer let me get a free coffee with my purchase!  I would recommend this place to anybody looking for coffee or little trinkets/knick knacks to bring back.

Among the souvenirs I bought were jalapeño peanut brittle and some Austiniana, as well as notecards by the Art from the Street project.

Holy Grounds ," 2/16/2015 1 check-in Listed in More than 100 in 2015! So, a couple of things to start out with.  First, the location on the Yelp map was incorrect -- it sent me to South Congress St., which couldn't have been further from the actual location.  Secondly, you really have to dig into the reviews to see that it's actually inside the church (and not visible at all from the street). Kinda frustrating, but not their fault at all.  The cafe and little shop were really cute, with super affordable coffees (local, I believe), and breakfast treats. There was a bookstore, too, but I didn't have enough time to try it out.  It's a great little spot and much, MUCH cheaper (and better-tasting) than the Starbucks at the Hilton or the coffee stand inside the Convention Center. Definitely worth stopping by! I had the Starling roast, which was superb. ", pos

I would never have stumbled upon this place if I didn't know it was there, and what a shame for the average wanderer! Holy Grounds has: amazing music, a wide selection of books to read and purchase while sipping coffee, Tacodeli tacos, cozy chairs to curl up in, and most exciting for me, a Labyrinth Meditation Garden!!!! Walk down the stairs outside the church and you'll find yourself in a beautiful ivy-covered terrace. Follow the winding brick pathway and you'll find yourself in a new state of mind, observant, tranquil, content. The baristas are so sweet, the coffee and food everything I could ask for and maybe the best part is that it is so hidden, a place undiscovered by many and therefore so much more appreciated by those lucky enough to get to stop in here.

I highly suggest just a plain latte. The coffee is delicious and they also have a gift shop with some cute items.  Note--this is inside of St. David's church. You enter on the north end of the church.  Also, they have a $5 card minimum, but you can also create an account and they charge your total purchases on the 1st of every month. ", pos 
Holy Grounds ," 7/10/2012 23 check-ins First to Review Where can you drink fair trade coffee, eat Rockstar bagels and Kakawa chocolate covered cocoa beans, shop for hand blown glass with a low carbon footprint, browse Haitian wall art made from recycled oil drums, and pick up a copy of The Book of Common Prayer, too? If you replied: ""A south Austin hipster's apartment with a particularly random Anglican slant"", the judge's would say you were correct. But the answer we were looking for was ""Holy Grounds"", the coffee shop/bookstore located inside Austin's own St. David's Episcopal Church.  Whenever I have a conversation about the added perks that come with attending a downtown church, the fact that we have both Cafe Divine and Holy Grounds inevitably comes up. It's wonderful to have a built-in coffee shop for those times before or after service, or the days you find yourself at the church early during the week. Actually, it's where I say I'm ""going to go split a bagel with Jesus"".  It's also convenient to have an entire treasure trove of books to browse and purchase, especially if one will be used for a Journey Group, or a friend has recommended one for you to check out. As expected, many of the major Anglican/Episcopalian writers can be found, but among those with more general Christian topics and philosophy.  I think what people also need to know is that Holy Grounds is open to the public. This is definitely a new place to try if you work downtown in the area, as this may be a surprisingly close locale to grab some coffee or a snack. My personal favorite is a basic iced latte, but I am definitely interested in trying a Mayan Mocha, which they list as a customer favorite. Also, it's located in a church, so...you're kind of guaranteed friendly service from the baristas.  Speaking of service, in the recent past I had been scouring the entire city (including the Episcopal seminary) to try and find an Episcopal shield bumper sticker for my car. It costs less than a dollar, and to me should have been everywhere, but for some reason I couldn't find it online for the life of me, and I was told that the bookstore had stopped ordering this particular style. I left my name and number in case they ever came across one.  I had all but forgotten this request, when, months later, they received a shipment and someone called to tell me that my sticker was in. I couldn't believe it. Like I said, even *I* had forgotten about it, so it was remarkable they had remembered and had called me.  I'm notoriously unlucky with greeting cards, but Holy Grounds has a wide assortment to choose from by local artists Michael H. McKann and Ben Sargent. Naturally, it's easy to find cards for religious occasions such as baptisms, marriages, etc.  Along with Bibles and prayer books, this is the first place in town I've ever seen Anglican prayer beads for sale. Handmade by the Austin company ""Fiber Figments"", I have my eye on them, although I need to learn exactly how to pray them first before I actually purchase one.  In short: from breakfast tacos to quiche, candles to cards, Bibles to blown glass...Holy Grounds has it all.  Episcopalians with a passion for locally-sourced Austin goods? Now THAT's a real blessing!  5 Stars. Mayan Mocha ", pos 
Holy Grounds ," 7/13/2014 Tricky to find, located in an active church.  As you enter there are friendly greeters at a concierge desk,  the Holy Ground is  on the left in the gift shop.

I've been going here since it opened and my visits have slowed down significantly - the coffee has been meh the last few times.  I never used to get americanos (iced). I've never been a fan of the taste and end up overloading it with sugar. But Figure 8 has been the only place in the history of my life that can make an amazing americano and really capture the essence and notes of the roast - no anything else needed.  I'm so sad that it's just not as tasty...as the owners passed the torch to the baristas they've hired, I've just not really liked the coffee. I really really liked this place a lot...

Figure 8 Coffee Purveyors ," 6/29/2016 4 check-ins Figure 8 is an easy walk away from my humble little abode.  It's always bustling and draws a pretty good cross section of people. The inside is spacious enough and has an ample amount of tables for you to sit at.  It's impeccably decorated and has a really great energy about it. While parking isn't one that lends itself to its own private lot----there's plenty of street parking a hop skip and a jump away.  The coffee is pretty decent! I haven't had a cup that's made me make any undue faces yet. And they manage to make cappuccino art when I order with almond milk....which is impressive. :)  The only downside is that the folks working the counter are so friendly...that sometimes they get caught up in conversations with everyone around them....that you can be left standing at the counter, ignored----consciously-----for a couple of minutes. If you're not easily perturbed by this, then it won't faze you. But if you expect decent customer service in Austin (really----at this point, why is this still an expectation of yours?)---then you just roll with it and bat your pretty eyelashes at one of them till they wrap up their conversation.

Super cute, great ambience, not too noisy or too quiet, perfect atmosphere to hang out with friends or just study by yourself. Their interior design is really inviting and warm and with lots of sunlight---wayyy different than something like Epoch or Bennu's, which is usually darker, and more bright like Thunderbird's. Also, it wasn't even that busy on a Saturday afternoon though I think there was a small rush around 4 pm--but I definitely found myself an empty table. Not sure if they're super well-known yet, which might be why, but I wouldn't be surprised to find it super crowded in a few months (the way Thunderbird's is). There aren't many outlets, so I guess that might be the trickier thing.  Parking wasn't terrible--it is street parking, but I found quite a number of empty spots across the street and down the neighborhood. So it is doable.  The baristas were both really friendly though I didn't partake in any conversation with them. They went out of their way to hand me my coffee at the table and pick it up when I was done, which usually almost never occurs at other coffee shops.  Their coffee was GREAT.

I ordered an iced vanilla latte.  There is a lot of parking in the neighborhood, at least when we went, so that wasn't an issue, though the parking ""lot"" holds only three cars at a time. We came right before the rush, around 2pm so finding seating was pretty easy as well. The ambiance is nice, the music is non-intimidating and at an appropriate volume, and the decor is pleasing to the eye and minimalist, embodying the Austin spirit pretty well.  On the flip side, the beverages were solid, but not extraordinary. There are better options in Austin at a similar price point. We were quite disappointed after having read the raving reviews by other Yelpers. The tables are quite small, and the seating options are quite uncomfortable but manageable and sufficient in quantity [Quoting my friend: ""My butt hurts, so....""]. The wifi is a little slow, and the temperature is a little uncomfortable, slightly warmer than preferred. The bathroom smells a little funky, but it's not a big deal.

It is simple, crisply decorated and cozy, well thought out in a calm unpretentious way. I get a cup of their pour-over, which is done by the cup and by hand personally. It does not turn out to be the perfect cup, but that is not the important part. I decide 3/4 through the cup, with some light encouragement, to go and ask the staff about their brew process. I am my usual polite but very direct self. Instead of eye rolling and huffy hipster agitation at my gall and total lack of coolness, the gentelman at the bar pleasantly engages me in a brisk talk on the nuances of high end coffee brewing, and after a few min of chatter, Identifies correctly what my issue may be in the flavor profile of what I got, and asks if he can make me a different brew. He presides over the pour himself, and when it arrives it is EXACTLY the kind of coffee that I prefer and enjoy. This is not a very likely outcome, at all, The coffee has notes of ginger, citrus, molasses and malt, (I took notes) and a round, warm character totally unlike the sharp leading note of the first cup.

Figure 8 Coffee Purveyors ," 10/24/2015 So I'm in Figure 8 pretty much every day. If I'm not studying here, I'm passing through to get a coffee before heading to school.  1. The coffee is excellent. They cycle their espresso every few days, and if you ask the baristas which one you should get, they'll help you to figure that out. One is usually a more tangy espresso, while the other is less acidic.  2. This is a really chill place to study. They're always playing good music, the people that come here are great and most people are here to either read or do work. The only slight downside is that sometimes it gets hot inside and the AC doesn't quite overcome the heat, but that's when it's 95+ outside, and that isn't Figure 8's fault, it's just that Texas weather.  3. The baristas are all awesome. None of them have an edge or are snobby in the slightest (as can happen in some coffee shops).

It's currently roasting a coffee called Tweed which comes from the Houndstooth coffee family but the cool thing about Figure 8 is a plan to continuously rotate beans from all over the US.

They also serve Steeping Room tea if you prefer that over coffee.    Parking is street parking.

Figure 8 Coffee Purveyors ," 10/12/2014 1 check-in Small, intimate coffee house which the owners care about the process of coffee/espresso. I usually drink just coffee and none of the fancy stuff. The pastries were good. I sat at the bar while working on my assignment for class. There's a mirror wall, a table with a plant divider, good coffee and free WiFi. It's only been opened for two months.  Just a few notes - not many outlets and parking can be tricky. Too bad they can't be opened late though but I like Figure 8 and definitely a place to try out when you are in the area. ", pos

They have different varieties of coffee and although the cups are smaller than your regular mainstream coffee places, the price/quality ratio is really good. The ambiance was good and even though parking can be a bit difficult it is worth it! The one thing that is that the barista lady seem a bit distracted... Coffee is a serious business, so no room for distractions! ;) Overall, really good!!! ", pos 
Figure 8 Coffee Purveyors ," 4/18/2015 I've had dozens of cortados since they started popping up around Dallas coffee shops in the last few years. I love them...and Dallas has an increasingly large number of higher quality, third wave coffee shops (Davis St Espresso, Ascension, etc.). But Figure 8's cortado seemed like an instant winner for my own personal 'Best Cortado of All Time' award.  Many times they have a bitter aftertaste, but Figure 8's managed to be incredibly smooth (so damn smooth) yet strong and robust.  Also, a very unique, understated decor and atmosphere. I told the Barista (Chris?) it was the best cortado, and he was gracious and friendly. ", pos

Beautiful aloof plant placement, white tiles, wood counters, a hint of throwback glint. I mean, my cool quotient shot up just sitting there.  Lots of seating for people working or just meeting. Some outdoor seating out front too. Very interesting converted house feel in an offbeat part of town.  We got the cold brew and it was delightful, strong and perfect for an 80 degree spring day. I wanted to go back again the next day. Nay, I wanted to move in. But I will have to wait for my next trip back to Austin.  ps. this is the perfect place to escape SXSW madness. ", pos 
Figure 8 Coffee Purveyors ," 2/27/2015 1 check-in This place is a gem in the inside! I'm giving it 3 stars because they were lacking on snacks, which I always like to have as an option. When I went there was construction going on in the front (like they say, don't judge a book by its cover). The inside is very modern and light. The white walls and natural light coming from the windows don't make you feel like it's night outside at 4 pm. The baristas are friendly and their coffee is great. There's a big room to the left with tons of little tables to do work or hang out. I'd say this is an above average coffee shop, definitely check it out if you can. ", neutral

The space is small but comfortable, and they're in the process of putting in an addition for more space, so that's cool.  I will absolutely be back.

Figure 8 Coffee Purveyors ," 10/20/2014 Austin isn't short of quality coffee shops. So what makes Figure 8 5-star worthy?  Delicious coffee. I had an iced latte, and it was excellent. The espresso was rich, smooth, flavorful, and not sour. It's all I've had so far, but it already rivals some of the best I've tried in Austin. Apparently they roast Houndstooth's Tweed coffee roasters, as well as rotating other local roasters. I don't claim to be a coffee expert, but I can tell you Tweed just tastes good.  Inviting atmosphere. The shop is small, but not tiny. The feel is unique - think ""Happy Industrial Garden."" Similar to a happier, younger sibling of Wright Bros. Brew & Brew. Metal chairs and stools surround rugged wooden tables. White-painted brick meets exposed, painted rafters, concrete floors, and vintage light fixtures. The vibe is bright and cheerful, designed to invite natural light that complements the large mirror wall and ample greenery (a really nice touch). Two vintage Sony speakers flank an antique mirror above the coffee bar. Figure 8 has a happy interior, and I much prefer that to dark-and-cave-like (especially during the day).  Friendly staff. Ryan and Kathleen are kind, inviting, cheerful, chill, and knowledgable. They know their stuff, but there isn't an ounce of presumption in their work. They're the kind of people that make you happy to buy their product, and then come back again. ", pos

This place as made me a believer in Tweed. They also have a lovely pastry selection that includes vegan options!  I love the ambience and light the room gets in the early mornings. It's such a romantic shop. I typically don't use coffee shops as an office/workspace and really enjoy just having coffee and a good conversation.

Figure 8 Coffee Purveyors ," 9/24/2014 Product: The product is on point. I can tell they take pride in making sure every single drink is made to the best of their ability with delightful presentation, which to me is what puts the ""craft"" in craft anything. They are constantly adjusting the grind to make sure it's dialed in and so far it has been perfectly consistent, and consistency is one of the most important things to me for any business. As for food, the pastries they carry are ok but damn, their tacos are delicious! I love Taco Deli tacos, like a lot, but the one's at F8 are actually better and bigger.  Atmosphere: Proper and DIY. I love when I can walk into a place and it immediately hits me with a good vibe. Then when I take a moment to sit and notice small details and decor that I can tell were done with good taste and style on a small budget. That, to me, is so much cooler than walking into a place and it looks like they just sunk a hundred grand into it to impress but it feels stale and contemporary.  Service: So far, so good. I consistently am greeted with a smile, and consistently am asked about my day. No one has ever tried to sell me more than I've asked for. Of course they are both easy on the eyes and new business owners but I don't get a pretentious vibe from either of them. And as far as I know they both grew up in Austin and have been working in coffee shops and bars/restaurants on the east side for many years, which means they have easily earned their place on Chicon.  Complaint: Not enough Figure 8's in town :( ", pos

The body of the coffee and taste is just spectacular. I had mine iced with almond milk and just about everything was incredible. From the size to temperature to amount of ice, you name it. The perfect coffee. They also have Kouign Amann which is one of my favorite pastries. It's like a very sweet French croissant with a crown shape. It reminds me of Argentinian medialunas!

Mañana Coffee & Juice ," 9/27/2016 1 check-in I came by here in a party of 2 a little before 5 on a Saturday afternoon.  Parking: Parking anywhere near South Congress is a hassle, but we parked (for free) on a neighborhood street off West Monroe Street on the block adjacent to South Congress.  Atmosphere: The place is small. 4 chairs in the front as you walk in with a lot of natural light and room to put a laptop or so on the wall table. There is a longer table in the back with space for 6-8 people, and I believe there were two other small 2-person tables for chatting. There are also 3 bar stool like chairs to sit on that look into the workspace. My friend said the back terrace area is usually available as well but was not available due to a wedding reception. I'm not sure if it was just because of the reception, but my friend and I were forced to sit on the bar stools for a couple minutes before we sat near the door after a girl left. Definitely a cutesy cafe though.  Food/drink: I ordered a nitro-cold brew and enjoyed it! I think I would still prefer a regular cold brew if possible, but it wasn't bad.  Service (and some food): My cold brew (which was pre-brewed) didn't come out for like 10 minutes, so after I asked about it, the worker was super apologetic and let my friend and I get a free pastry each on the house! (FYI their pastries are half off after 5 pm anyways). Both the pastries were just good, nothing spectacular but I liked that it was free. They also had water/sparkling water on tap as well.  The coffee was decent, environment was ideal for some chatting, and the service made a fantastic recovery after a mistake. Would like to come back again!! Nitro cold brew Pastries ", pos 
Mañana Coffee & Juice ," 5/10/2016 Manana is the newest coffee shop on South Congress. It's boho-chic vibe is great for insta pics and interior design therapy. It's honestly beautiful.  The coffee is good and the baristas are friendly. It's more of a destination coffee shop to sit at with a friend and catch up. The set up isn't conducive to working remotely, but that's what I like about it. It's the perfect spot to sit with a couple of pals and talk. Inside or outside, you can't go wrong - it's all lovely.

I loved the cortado... Just enough milk and sweetness. I like my coffee strong and not too sweet so the cortado with a splash of house syrup was spot on.. And the coffee art is the perfect touch.  The macarons are delicious and huge. I hate small macarons!! I loved the PB&J macaron! I'm just dreaming about it now and wish that I had bought more.

I think people also grab a coffee while in line for South Congress Cafe...  The flavored drinks here are very light, meaning the flavor doesn't overpower the espresso, a feature that is to my liking. Their lattes are just bitter enough for my tastes.

It's the perfect spot to post up and get some work done. The big windows remind you that there is in fact life outside of your laptop, and the Mexican tile and overall aesthetic make it the perfect place to keep you buoyant and happy!

Mañana Coffee & Juice ," 5/23/2016 My dad and I had a lengthy discussion recently about how Austin coffee shops have become snooty. Don't worry about that here, because Manana coffee ended up on our ""friendly baristas"" list.  We came in after dropping my car off down the road at Twomey Automotive (see previous Yelp Review- for best car body shop in town). I had been previously to the hotel for their cinco de mayo event, but after coming back realized how much they took out for the event (makes since drunk adults and expensive modern furniture don't mix).  Anyways, we were pleased to be surprised by our service at manana coffee. My cortado (first time getting one) even came served with a heart on top. The décor reminded us of our recent visit to San Antonio, it has that Southwest Texas meets Mexican vibe.  Seemed to be a mix of locals and tourists inside, but as a local we were excited to see this place doing so well on  South Congress. As Austin is booming with new businesses, i'm hoping this one stays- it's got class and good service. I can't wait to go back! ", pos

It's near the back of the open courtyard area, so it feels like a retreat away from the hustle and bustle of South Congress Road.  So far, their made-to-order drink menu consists only of coffees (which is fine by me) and not yet juices. They do have bottled Juiceland juices in the fridge though.  There's a good amount of pastries to choose from. The one I had was good. They apparently make them in-house. Impressive.  I'd come back to read a book...or the paper, if I did that sort of thing.

Mañana Coffee & Juice ," 7/17/2016 First of all, this place is beautiful. No surprise, since it's part of the South Congress Hotel! The whole place was bright, light and airy, and felt like a breath of fresh air after walking around in the heat. The tiled coffee counter is stunning and so picture-worthy if you're into that. The barista behind the register was super friendly - she actually seemed like she wanted to be there and that she genuinely wanted me to enjoy my experience, which is not always the case with overworked Austin baristas. I resisted the pastries in the case because I knew I didn't need one....but they looked amazing - not your typical coffeeshop pastries. I ordered an iced almond milk latte, like I do at every coffee shop I go to for the first time, and it was excellent. The almond milk was creamy and had a fresh taste with no weird after taste that sometimes comes with almond milk. It didn't overpower the espresso - I need to still be able to tell there is coffee in there, and this was perfect. My one complaint would be that I wish the size was a little bigger, but I'm guessing that it's high quality stuff and they would have to charge more for a bigger size - not a big enough deal to make me remove a star, especially because the ambiance was so wonderful! that tiled coffee bar ", pos

Summer Moon Coffee Bar ," 11/29/2016 1 check-in First time here to check out this place. It's a small coffee place a few miles from the hustle and bustle of the university. It was about 4:00 Sunday afternoon, and it was not too crowded. All the patrons seemed to be focused on what they were doing. The setting is causal and community-like, which is intentionally catered for nearby university folks. The ""bar"" part refers more to the setting than the fact they serve alcohol. They have long bar tables and chairs, along with a few regular wooden tables in the middle and some small sofa chairs against the inside wall.  We had a wintermoon latte with their much sought-after ""moon milk"". It was very smooth, sweet, and noticeably creamier than usual. We also got a mocha moon. It had all the good stuff of the latte, plus the chocolaty flavor.  If you're out of luck finding a spot inside, you can try the patio in the front. There are a few tables and a bar table on one side. It was from a raised deck with plenty of tree branches hanging over it. Nothing fancy, but it gives you a pleasant view of the traffic on 1st Street when you feel bored on what you're doing.  I have to say parking is no fun. We spotted a space in the parking lot behind the building, but it was a bit too small for our vehicle. We couldn't u-turn out and had to cautiously back our way out. We finally parked on a side street. It was a nice walk to the shop though.  Another thing is this place opens late till 12:00 midnight. So if you need a late night coffee, come on by!

I got the half moon latte as other reviewers have said the summer moon latte was too heavy and sweet. Half moon is delicious and perfectly made! It's creamy and has the right amount of sweetness. I'm not one for coffees that taste like a straight up milk shakes and I typically drink my coffee black. This drink definitely satisfied my sweet tooth craving.  The atmosphere is very ""austin"" and I was able to get work done. The noise volume wasn't bad and the music wasn't distracting. They have bar counters and a few tables for those who need more space. Really great place for coffee and studying!! Only down side is that parking is a little tricky. ", pos

If their goal is to provide you with a stellar coffee experience by simply delivering on the promise of great coffee- all I can say is well done. I hope I don't find out that one day the secret ingredient ""moonmilk"" which seemingly consists of a minimum of 9 different dairy milks- is some how laced with cocaine! I've never been addicted to a food or beverage before and I can honestly tell you that this was a first. The summer moon latte, 007 and Mocha Moon are all amazing.

Love how they have tacodeli breakfast tacos in the morning, too! I'm sure they sell out, but there has always been a decent taco selection in the mornings on the weekends when I've gone around 9-10am.

Summer Moon Coffee Bar ," 3/15/2016 1 check-in Listed in Austin, TX (ATX) I'm assuming there is crack in that moon milk because omg that (iced) wintermoon latte was delicious. Initially it was too sweet for me (if you're not a fan of sweetness, I'd get a half moon latte) but I think that once the ice started melting, the sweetness mellowed out.  I forgot to check what moon milk was exactly made out of, but it made the iced latte very rich and creamy. Definitely recommend!

I ordered an iced caramel latte (my go-to drink) but they don't have caramel here.  The barista recommended a half wintermoon because of the hint of caramel flavor mixed in with the vanilla ice cream. I decided to order a bacon, egg, and cheese hand pie too.  Both were so good. Wow. I wish I could have this hand our every morning for breakfast. It's fat, flaky, and filling. And no shortage of cheese (plus for that).  Coffee was good, the perfect amount of sweet for me. I've been decreasing my reliance in sugar in my coffee so thank goodness this wasn't overwhelmingly sweet.  Desk space is limited, with a bar-like type of set up in the middle for people to work in community style, side-by-side. It's interesting and not as uncomfortable as I thought it'd be. There are two good-sized tables so if you need a lot of workspace, try to snag one. The small tables and bar-top setup are OK if you want to just read or journal or something or if you have just a laptop and nothing else. I happened to bring some books with me for Bible study so this was perfect for me.  And I love that it's not too quiet and not too loud. Perfect noise level for working.

There was quite a line and most of the tables were full, which we took to be a good sign. Ordered an almond latte and a frozen hot chocolate. Both were very well made. We also decided to order a couple of breakfast items. The premade breakfast tacos were ok; not bad, just not anything to write home about. The handpie was delicious and decent size. Big fans of this one! The chocolate croissant was unfortunately not fresh so I didn't even finish it.  There's a small parking lot, but it was full when we pulled up so we parked on the side street. They have a small outdoor seating area, which was nice. I hesitated to give this café only 3 stars, but the service was so stand offish and rude. The guy working the register and taking our orders was probably the least friendly person we came into contact with in our 4 days in Austin.

With locations off of Burnet, S. 1st and Buda , they have graciously placed caffeine near my home, work and a best friend.  So very kind of them.  Try the summermoon, their signature drink.  It is basically a latte made with crack.  I mean, milk.  I mean, there might be crack in the milk.  Whatever they put in there, it is sweet and i start to itch if i don't have one every few days. If it is too sweet, try ordering it as a half- moon and they cut back on the sugary milk.  Also, you can get your moon milk made with almond milk for a non dairy option.  Try a bag of their house roasted coffee, it is stellar and has a slightly smokey taste from their wood burning oven.    Can we talk about the hand pies?  They are buttery, flaky and come in many flavors.  I suggest the chicken pot pie.  The new Burnet location also serves TacoDeli tacos.

Didn't see it on the menu but WOOHOO! He also said their coconut milk alternative was called the Beach Boys. Lol the other barriers wasn't familiar with the names so I think he just made them up but they should definitely think about adding it on the board.  SummerMoon/Tokyo was delicious! I felt like I was drinking milk tea cause it was so creamy and smooth. It was also the perfect level of sweet! I do like my coffee sweet but it wasn't TOO sweet. I got a 12 oz and I wish I got a bigger cup!  The interior was also super cute with a lot of single seats like a bar type tables. Seemed pretty calm and relaxed so I could see myself getting some work done but I'm not sure about it being a good study spot.  Tl;dr - try anything with moon milk!

I don't think going there at least 4 times a week and dreaming about it is a problem. A problem is if I would day dream about how to make my own Moon Milk - realize I will never unearth the recipe and accept the fact I will spend my life savings at Summer Moon. A problem would be buying a t-shirt from there hoping it would smell like Moon Milk and then I would never wash it. Ever. A problem would be buying a mug from there and hoping/wishing/praying that Moon Milk would magically appear in my bland coffee like some kind of Harry Potter voo doo.  Well since I do none of that I can just say that Summer Moon is amazing. The Moon Milk is one of a kind and made of unicorn tears. Just what I imagined unicorn tears to taste like.

My only complaint I have is that the service could be slow.  I took a friend here who was visiting and was craving local coffee shops and only ordered a latte with almond milk.  I swear it must have taken more than 10 minutes to get her coffee and we had to remind the staff that we were still waiting for hers.  Were they out of almond milk and ran to the store to get it?

Summer Moon Coffee Bar ," 12/30/2015 3 check-ins Listed in Om Noms Austin Props to Summermoon for making me able to drink my first cup (okay, 1/4 cup) of black coffee! Personally, I'm not too crazy about coffee and don't actually enjoy the taste of it most of the time and never (before Summermoon) could I drink it black. Plenty of milk and sugar is usually how I roll.  My first couple experiences here, I tried their variety of lattes which are made with infamous Moonmilk-- a sweetened milk spiced with a secret blend of spices and everything nice. The Summer Moon is super sweet, too much so even for me, so my favorite of all was their Half Moon (half as sweet as the Summer). Their Mocha Moon has a nice deeper flavor and wasn't too chocolatey. They also offer seasonal options like an Autumn Moon (pumpkin spiced) in the Fall and Peppermint Joy in the Winter all of which were delicious.  As for their drip coffee, I recently took one of my brothers here while we were touring around Austin and he's a purist when it comes to coffee. When he took his first sip, his eyes perked up and he said that it was really good so I decided that I would try it and I liked it a lot! I still prefer mine with cream and sugar though. I don't really know coffee enough to know what makes one cup better than another, but I believe my brother and all the other people who know coffee who are crazy about this place to know that there's something truly special here at Summermoon.

Like everywhere else that's popular in Austin, there's shitty parking and make sure you're prepared to stand in a line (unless you get there at 7 am on a weekday). Park on the street (in the correct direction if you're not a moron). And be prepared to listen to endless drivel from boring spoiled UT kids.  They recently re-did the menu boards, taking off the prices. I don't like that. That's sketchy AF. The prices went up. Don't let them fool you.  When it's hot as balls outside, drink the 1/2 wintermoon. It's not as sweet as the ""normal"" wintermoon, but it's still very sweet. Add an extra shot or four if you feel crazy.  Do yourself a favor and sit outside. It's cozy on that cute porch. They don't take orders from the window anymore, sadly, but that's okay! It's not that hard to get up and go stand in that line inside ;)  TLDR: drinks are great (GET THE HALF WINTERMOON, NOW). food is decent but nothing to write home about if you're a tourist. parking sucks.

Summer Moon Coffee Bar ," 8/23/2016 First, their coffee is absolutely heaven in a cup. I'm not a huge fan of iced coffee or overly sweet drinks, so I always get the half moon latte. Words cannot describe what happens to your mouth or brain as you drink it. It's straight up ambrosia. I find myself laying up awake some nights thinking about that latte.  The reason that they lose a star is for ambiance. While it seems to be a great place to work, it's not really a place where I would ever meet a friend just for coffee and a chat. They have the straight-up dingiest fabric chairs along their back wall. I literally feel like I need to change my clothes after sitting on them. I'm not kidding - I would literally find it preferable to sit on the bare floor. Unfortunately, there's nowhere else inside to sit if you are just there for fun, and those dirty chairs are usually open. (I wonder why!)  If Summer Moon invested in swapping those terrible lounge chairs out, I would probably visit a lot more! In the end, their moon lattes are terrific, but seating not so much. ", pos

The comfy seating indoors was mostly taken, especially all of the couches. They had a lot of empty stools inside, but sitting on a stool for a few hours = back pain. We ended up finding two chairs right by the door. Although they have outdoor seating, it had just rained and everything was damp.  Summermoon gets great business. But that also means it gets loud and the inside has an overall cluttered feel to it. I prefer more of a calmer ambiance.    I'm not much of a coffee person, so I ordered the carrot apple smoothie and vegan pot pie. Both were good (although expensive). They also don't take Discover or American Express, so I had to pay with the limited cash I had on me.

Summer Moon Coffee Bar ," 7/11/2016 Before I get into the details, if you're just skimming these reviews... Buy a HALF WINTER MOON LATTE (basically a semi-sweet ICED coffee). This is the drink to buy here.  Let me first preface... this 5 star review is based pretty much solely on the TASTE of the ICED COFFEE. I'm comparing based on yumminess relative to all other iced coffee varieties I've had. If you're looking for a standard cold brew with no additives, or if you want a well-lit work space, then this rating would be lower. The coffee is so good that I've decided to basically ignore the issues. I crave this coffee when I come home from being away.  Pros: - I have had pretty much every ice coffee / cold brew in Austin at this point, and the Half Winter Moon latte is as good as it gets. That said, if you don't like your coffee milky and a bit sweet then you likely have a very different measure for iced coffees - Line moves pretty quickly, tho it is generally long - Lots of cool swag that they switch out every few months it seems (I have several mugs and mason jars myself) - No other ""wood fired"" coffees in town that I know of. There's really not much else that tastes like it  Cons: - The parking is bad (but it's the same pretty much anywhere in Austin so I don't notice anymore) - The seating is limited and not very awesome (they used to have a much cooler set up that fit the aesthetic more, but the new counter has lots of outlets and fits more people) - No prices on the board, which they changed and is kinda weird ", pos 
Summer Moon Coffee Bar ," 9/2/2015 3 check-ins Listed in comfy, cozy, & chill Hey friends, don't get me wrong, okay?! The ""secret 7-ingredient recipe"" moon milk is AMAZING. It tastes like coffee creamer on vanilla ice cream steroids. Always down for vanilla ice cream steroids. But in my Half Wintermoon (yup, I even got the half sugar option), it was a little too sweet. Like, ""the back of my throat hurts a little bit"" too sweet. For a rich, decadent drink - if I'm ever craving a caffeinated milkshake - I would come here in a heartbeat, but for a daily go-to coffee fix, I'd pass on the Wintermoon.  The chicken cordin bleu hand pie was DELICIOUS. Buttery, golden crust, and a creamy, flavorful chicken & cheese & ham filling. Loved it.  The place itself is pretty chill. I like the music! However, all of the table space is relatively small, aside from two larger square tables.

Summer Moon Coffee Bar ," 5/8/2016 1 check-in The Half Moon is hands down the best latte I've had in Austin. I'm glad I opted for the Half Moon over the Summermoon as I found it to be the perfect amount of sweetness. The espresso was smooth, and left me with a real kick. The parking lot is small and the shop cozy, but it's worth it. ", pos 
Summer Moon Coffee Bar ," 5/23/2016 I love this place. We came here to enjoy a cup of cafe after a long day. I got plain drip coffee and the ""bae"" (as the kids say) got the half moon. Both of us were very VERY pleased with our choices. I even bought whole beans to make the sweet nectar from the gods at home.  If you like really sweet coffee go for the Summermoon. But neither of us can drink things that sweet so the half moon is perfect in our opinion.  Go here. You'll love it. I promise.  Four stars for no real mugs. I don't mind paper cups, but a trendy shop like this should offer mugs. ", pos 
Summer Moon Coffee Bar ," 9/10/2015 We liked the coffee at Summermoon but the store is nothing special. It's apparently a big college place as pretty much every seat was occupied by what appeared to be students working on laptops. It's a functional if not particularly comfortable place, mostly an assortment of desk-type chairs and Formica countertops and tables. There are a lot of power outlets.  I had an iced Americano. 3 shots of very good espresso in a 16 oz drink hit the spot! My wife ordered iced tea (don't recall the variety) but they were out. She got an iced coffee, instead. She said it was too strong for her but generally I'd say that's a good thing.  I bought some of their Ethiopian whole bean in-house roasted coffee to go. They do a nice medium roast, not the usual over roasted beans you get from a lot of places. Ethiopian coffees have nice floral tastes that really come out in Summermoon's roast. Well done!  Summermoon is a good place to drop in to grab a cup when you're on S 1st. ", neutral 
Summer Moon Coffee Bar ," 8/7/2016 You guys. This coffee must have crack in it or something- I'm literally OBSESSED and ADDICTED! It really is so good. Sometimes the full ""summermoon latte"" is a little too sweet. Order the 3/4 Moon if you want that yummy moon milk, just less sugary! ", pos 
Summer Moon Coffee Bar ," 6/12/2016 Summer Moon is without a doubt my favorite coffee shop in Austin! I have tried many coffee shops to compare, and honestly nothing comes close to the incredible coffee at Sumer Moon. The ""moon milk"" they put in some of their drinks is addicting in a very good way. If you are in the mood for a coffee drink that tastes like cake in a cup, try the Iced Wintermoon Latte. If you want something not as sweet but still delicious, try the Iced 1/2 Wintermoon Latte.

Summer Moon Coffee Bar ," 2/3/2016 Bottom line- Coffee is great, servers/snacks are not.  I tried the half wintermoon latte, which was AMAZING. I wish I could go more often, but they don't open until 8, usually my work-time. I can imagine if you have a hankering for a sweet drink, the regular wintermoon/summermoon would be fantastic!  I also picked up a muffin, which ended up being the most vial thing I have ever tasted and was thrown away. Gluten free banana can be great, but this was not- drive, flavorless, dirt. That's alright though- I don't judge a coffee shop by their sweets.  The staff weren't friendly to me whatsoever. I was actually quite taken aback by how I was treated. So, a place I would go for coffee but not stay for coffee!  Overall, the coffee was perfect. I will go again and again and again, given the opportunity. I just don't expect anything from the baristas :) ", neutral

Summer Moon Coffee Bar ," 2/8/2016 Listed in Yelp 100 Challenge Summer Moon is this cute, little, eclectic, coffee bar right outside of downtown Austin.  It is as ""Austin"" as it gets.  Upon entering you immediately notice the array of different people from all different walks of life, hanging out, studying and just enjoying their awesome coffee.  I was first introduced to this wonderful place last summer.  I spent all day in hair and makeup, as two of my friends were getting married.  My husband, did not have to spend all day in hair and make up and got to run around town tasting all that Austin had to offer.  I'm not a coffee snob, but I do love it when my coffee doesn't get all acidic and sour and that was a huge plus. They wood-fire roast their coffee (I'm not even sure what it does exactly but it sounds fancy, and fancy always means delicious?) which makes them different than a lot of places.    However, it's that moon milk that makes this place.  It's so creamy and not overly sweet, but just all sorts of amazing.  I'm usually pretty good at replicating things that I taste, but I can't seem to get this right!  Unfortunately I live in Houston so Summer Moon has just become a place for me to visit whenever I go to Austin, but, that just means that I have to go to Austin more often now! (My poor wallet.)

Summer Moon Coffee Bar ," 2/8/2016 Summermoon...my second home, literally.  Moved here last May for physical therapy school and am here pretty much on a daily basis sometimes twice a day.  I'm a big coffee person and have had many to drink from many different states but who would've thought the best cup of coffee i would ever have in my life would come from my home state of Texas.  My go to drinks: -MOONTADO with an extra shot (has been my go to for the past month or so) -half moon latte when i'm feeling cold -half winter moon latte when i'm feeling hot -007 when i need a slight caffeine kick but don't want to be drinking a lot of liquid -moonraker when I need to be wired (regular moon lattes are sweeter)  Seating can be limited sometimes especially over the weekend but its a good place to study or do whatever if you can grab a seat.  Vibes are always great and each and every employee have been nothing but wonderful to me.    If you are visiting, please make this your first coffee stop as it will probably be the best life decision you have ever made. You'll probably see me there.  Toodles. ", pos 
Summer Moon Coffee Bar ," 5/1/2016 This is going to be an overly optimistic review. 4 stars IS generous, but warranted.  According to Belly, I have checked into this location 726 times since 04/2012. Shame on me for never writing a review.  I go to Summermoon for the great coffee and fantastic people.  Moonmilk is amazing. I've heard most of the rumors about what it is, but the baristas keep their lips tightly sealed about the exact recipe. The latest rumor is that it's melted down Amy's Mexican Vanilla ice cream (I hope that one is true).  The moonmilk mystery adds to the experience. It's complex flavor keeps you wondering what it is, but you don't know, so you sip more to try to know. It's close to a religious experience. Extreme, I know.  The staff are the best. I have a great relationship, as a regular, with each barista. Those behind the counter are hipsters. They'll remind you they're people and not only your order takers. Appreciate them because they're about serve you (probably) the best coffee you've ever had.  The rest of what you read in the reviews are true. The parking is difficult, the bathroom is outside and unclean, the coffee shop is small... on and on...  I don't know about you, but I go to a coffee shop FIRST for coffee. When I find something rare and unique like Summermoon, overcoming the hurdles is justifiable and don't take away from a positive rating. ", pos 
Summer Moon Coffee Bar ," 7/5/2015 5 check-ins Best cup of coffee I have EVER had!  I know this seems like a bold statement but let me assure you I have drank a lot of coffee in my 40 years on this planet. I have had a best cup of coffee experience once before about 15 years ago but it has been knocked off its throne by the Summermoon latte.  We were looking for a place to grab an evening coffee before what was going to be a late night in Austin. Found this place on yelp and headed to Summermoon.  When we first walked in I noted that this appeared to be your average little coffee shop with tables and chairs scattered about with people illuminated from the glow of their laptops. As I approached the coffee bar I was expecting to be greeted with the I'm too cool to help you attitude so common among baristas. I was shocked when the girl greeted me with an enthusiastic, ""Hey! How are you guys? Looks like you've been doing something fun. What are your plans for the 4th of July? That sounds so cool!"" Wait. What? A friendly barista can this be true? It is!!  I then looked over their menu. Settled on the Summermoon latte. It is a latte made with ""moon milk"". I have no idea what is in moon milk as that is a secret. It is milk with I believe 7 secret ingredients. What ever it is it is stinking DELICIOUS!!  My latte arrived quickly and was delivered by another equally friendly employee. Upon my first sip I knew I had discovered my perfect cup of coffee. I have been in Austin for 2 more days and I have awoken each morning wanting another cup. I won't be leaving here today without one!! ", pos

Summer Moon Coffee Bar ," 1/25/2016 The wood-fired coffee is super yummy. We always grab a bag to bring home to FL each time we come back to Austin. The Moon Milk is totally over the moon. I've got my suspicions as to what it is, but I won't be so unkind as to share my ideas (or their secrets).  The line is always long (which is fine, the coffee is good so I get it) but the service is super slow. It's as if like each employee is competing to prove which one of them cares less about costumers. Fortunately for the business owners, the quality of the coffee is worth forgiving the total lack of customer service. ", pos

We got the summer moon latte in the 20 oz. it comes with 3 shots but we got a 4th shot complimentary woot! They make their coffee with this special concoction called moon milk. Yes it tastes as deliciously mysterious as it sounds. It was described to us as a mixture of melted vanilla Icecream and toasted marshmallows. How can you go wrong with that? They also offer the half moon which is less sweet but I think the original tasted perfect just the way it is. A lot of coffee shops I go to is for the ambiance but I'll be coming back here for the delicious coffee. , pos 
Summer Moon Coffee Bar ," 6/24/2016 This is one of those, ""five star reviews but I sure do have something to say."" I come here at least 1x a week. The MM is shamefully the bomb.com and the vibes are good. Heck I even had my first date with my current boyfriend here. Good networking. Love the spinach egg and cheese tacos. Parking blows but welcome to ATX. Get the Wintermoon (iced) or Summermoon (hot) latte and your life will be complete. Everyone is always smiling and happy, EXCEPT the crotchety cashier/barista. There is a dude man (haven't seen his sour face in a month or so), and particularly this petite brunette lady with lenses. I'm twice her size and still feel like she is going to spit fire or eat me alive if I don't order fast enough or if I waited in line 10 minutes to simply ask if you had any more bfast tacos left like it was a huge waste of HER time. Hi. Welcome to a cafe. We're the ones in a rush, not you. I'm a cashier myself, and know that once I clock in, I'm now a smiling ray of freakin sunshine no matter what. Welcome to adulthood where we suck it the hell up :-) It's a dark place but pays the bills.  I would never give this place a bad rating due to one poor employee. This place ROCKS. My only suggestions are: 1) teach her how to make a coffee and give her dark sunglasses 2) take a few minutes to create a quick sign you can stick up by the tacos to avoid customers waiting for one taco to find out (and possibly be stabbed) there are none left. 3) there are unfamiliar customers constantly walking up the outside ramp to see if the order window is indeed in play. Which it rarely is. I sit out here often & I just point them back inside. Again, all it takes is a friendly sign :-) ", pos

Summer Moon Coffee Bar ," 6/20/2015 1 check-in Listed in I enjoy beverages One random weekday night I seemed to find myself needing a place to work in south Austin. Hey! This place has wood fired coffee. Not sure what it means but it broke the tie between the abundance of Austin coffee shops.  Coffee: I had the regular drip wood fired and accidentally put too much half and half so it was realllly good. But I think it was also the coffee's fault. Yum!  Working: I easily found a spot with a plug for my laptop and I didn't feel cramped. This place doesn't hold a ton of people and I liked that. Less annoyance. I felt surprisingly comfortable here - I think because most everyone was working quietly for the few hours I was. Not a lot if chatty cathys or whatever.  Bathroom is in the hall. Cheat sheets on the tables for passwords. Nice place, I would return!!! ", pos 
Summer Moon Coffee Bar ," 12/8/2014 104 check-ins Summermoon is my ultimate favorite coffee - in the world, hands down.  I am a religious customer and have been ever since I discovered this place several years ago. The Half Wintermoon with 4 shots of espresso is my drink of choice. It costs just as much as a drink from Starbucks but 10 times better (about $5 for a 20 ounce).  The Wintermoon alone is a little too creamy for me, although still delicious. I recently switched to regular coffee of the day (cheaper and warmer) with the famous secret 'Moon milk.' Moon milk is organic, sweet, and a curious buttery milk.  You still get that unique creamy taste you can't get anywhere else in Austin. The coffee is also the only wood fired coffee in Austin.  This place can get pretty full because it's a great place to study. I love taking a book or laptop here and hanging out for a couple hours. There are also breakfast tacos in the mornings I'd you get there earlier enough!  Parking in the front can get crowded, so try the back parking lot or side streets. ", pos

I came here to get a little work done and it was a fun break from the monotonous work from home life. The music was cool, plenty of outlets and chairs. The important part though is the coffee and drinks. Pretty freakin good. I don't really drink coffee or tea but I tried some and I was not disappointed at all. I would definitely come again.

I live in this neighborhood, but I'm about to move so I will definitely be missing this place. Although I'm not quite as much of a fan of their hot drinks (the cappuccinos are overly foamy), this is completely made up for by how great their iced drinks are. The moon milk is SOO good. Whatever the combination, it makes the best flavored latte I've ever had. I recommend the moonraker (if you can handle 4 shots of espresso) or the wintermoon latte. Staff is also very friendly and will remember your order if you come in a lot. I also like that they offer the Belly rewards points that add up to earn you a free shirt or drink. ", pos 
Summer Moon Coffee Bar ," 10/13/2015 I never stepped foot into Summermoon yet since I'm over a thousand miles away...but I've been feeding my addiction ordering their coffee beans online. Who knew the start of loyalty would stem from my friend bringing me back a bag of coffee beans to try from her recent trip to Austin?  --Velvet Blaze: Their signature bean! It's pretty well-rounded but probably the most oily, so I had to play around with the ratio of bean to water a bit. Very balanced flavor profile and low acidity. I'm a fan.  --Swinging Lantern: This consisted of 3 different roasts (light, medium, and dark). It's a unique concept, but it didn't work for me. There was an unfavorable cinnamon aftertaste from the light roast beans. I wouldn't get this again.  --Wild Fire: This is my favorite so far, but it's no surprise since Sumatra is my favorite type of bean. This will be a regular order for sure!  I still have a bag of En Fuego coffee beans to try. I'll revisit this review when I do :)  Pricing is very reasonable (almost a steal, really!): $12.95 per bag and free shipping if you order 3 or more bags. My current favorite coffee bean is sold only in-store at a shop in LA and this is priced at $22 per bag, but it doesn't have the complexity and hard work of a wood-fire roasted bean. Summermoon is now my main coffee source with its great quality roasts and reasonable prices! ", pos 
Summer Moon Coffee Bar , 5/2/2015 Mmmmmmm that moon milk is somethin delicious for a dessert coffee.  If you don't have a sweet tooth maybe just try the half moon milk with your coffee.

They have summermoon(hot) , wintermoon(over ice) and then half moon which is what I got. The half moon is half as sweet as the summer moon. They make it with what is called moon milk and it's only 7 ingredients but it's a family secret.  The girl who took my order and made my latter also threw in an extra shot for free. Smoothest, and creamiest latte!! I will get one on my way out of Austin!  Only downfall is parking. I did get lucky and pull right into a spot but there isn't enough Peking so park on side street.

Once we hit 5 p.m. traffic in Austin I said let's go get some coffee and bypass this cluster f**k of traffic on 35! We hightailed it to Summermoon and both ordered iced coffees half sweet. If I remember correctly that is a half wintermoon. So delicious and creamy. I can't see myself getting a full amount of sweetener because half was more than enough.

Summer Moon Coffee Bar ," 4/12/2015 1 check-in Summermoon doesn't seem like the best place to do work. I've never tried but it's sort of small.  That said, I don't do much work at coffeeshops. Usually, the only business I'm attending to is the business of getting caffeine.  Summermoon has a magically thing called moonmilk. I don't really know what's in it (other than, presumably, condensed milk) but it's totally amazing. I have to assume that it's horribly unhealthy because everything that tastes this good has to be unhealthy.  Plus, the wood-roasted coffee really does have a different taste to it. I've got pretty basic taste when it comes to coffee and don't normally have brand preferences but Summermoon is the first coffee I've had that really stood out as better.  The big downside, however, is that it's only open until Midnight M-F and 10PM on Saturday. I drive for Lyft on the weekends and those hours make it hard to swing by for a midnight coffee run on Saturdays. ", pos 
Summer Moon Coffee Bar ," 9/19/2014 Listed in Best Coffee Shops Summermoon is a great coffee house with two unique things that make it special.  Let me start with the basics first: there s a parking lot but it can be a challenge at peak times. I have been able to park around the block, which I don''t mind when the coffee is worth it, like at Summermoon.  There is a outdoor seating space and there is plenty of indoor comfy space too. You will almost always find people working or doing homework. Free WiFi of course.  The coffee is very good. I always have a latte or the house latte. The first special thing about this place is their wood fired/roasted coffee. I don't know if it makes the coffee taste better or if I am predisposing myself, but it feels very smooth, almost anti-Stabucks.  The house special uses their own moon mil, which is the other unique thing at Summermoon. It is a bit to sweet and creamy for me but it is different and worth trying.  Right now, this is my go-to place for south central Austin coffee. ", pos

Summer Moon Coffee Bar ," 1/8/2016 6 check-ins Heard about this place from friends that swear by the coffee here. After hearing about how they needed their 'moon milk fix' we wanted to come here New years day but it was closed. I came here for the first time a few days ago, I was waiting to post my review after a second visit to be sure that this deserves the five stars and ordered something different off the menu and was absolutely blown away again. I love how subtle and simple this place is. They have their secret milk recipe and leave it to that to spice up the usual cup of coffee. The first time I came here I ordered the summermoon latte, I was expecting a latte that got most of its flavor from the espresso but was pleasantly surprised with my first sip. I thought the taste was something similar to a soy caramel latte with a little something extra but a million times better. My only complaint was that it was a bit sweet and got a little hard to drink towards the bottom however I got a small and finished it within 5 minutes and wished I ordered a size bigger. I will probably be getting the half moon next time after reading some more reviews saying its not as sweet. Last night I got the espresso milkshake and i'm not sure what I was expecting but again was blown away by the taste. The shake was creamy and delicious. The consistency was easy to drink and wasn't too thick or runny. I'm not sure if they put the moon milk in the shake but the taste was completely different from the summermoon but still had that something extra that made the taste unique. It wasn't too sweet or didn't taste like it was made with tons of artificial syrups. Definitely a place worth going out of the way for and will definitely be frequenting a lot more while I'm in Austin! espresso milkshake moonmilk secret See all photos from Naomi M. for Summer Moon Coffee Bar ", pos

The parking lot is very small and can be difficult to find a spot. The shop has a very hipster feel with lots of people drinking coffee and on their laptops or chatting it up with their friend. It was full for a Thursday late afternoon.  They advertise moon milk as a sweet and creamy blend with 7 secret ingredients. My bf and I decided to try share a 20oz half super moon drink. The half super moon is half the sweetness. I'm not are what was in it but I was delicious!

An intricacy of pristine beans and a mild hint of smokiness from the fire it has been blessed with creates a deep and enchanting flavor that you won't forget with each sip that you take in order to fulfill the desire you have to consume this precious nectar.

I was so sad to hear earlier this year that the owner had passed away and that the fate of the shop was in jeopardy. However, they are open and thriving, so it seems like someone took over the shop.  For vegans (not me, but sometimes), they have an excellent selection of vegan baked goods, vegan coffee options, and vegan ice cream. I've tried most of it, and you might not ever know that it's vegan. The ice cream is particularly delicious.  The non-vegan ice cream (from a company in San Francisco) is also bomb. Particularly the brownie batter fudge! It haunts my dreams.  For the coffee lover, their menu is extensive and contains options most other shops don't have. And the employees have great expertise in their craft. Aside from the expertise, they beans they use are top notch as are all of the other ingredients - leading to some truly excellent coffee.  The parking situation in this center (Black Star, Fuzzy's, etc) is pretty terrible, so be patient and remember that the garage has multiple levels. ", pos 
Fat Cats Organic Coffee And Dessert ," 11/17/2016 Listed in In Search of Fantastic Coffee A friend and I came in to Fat Cats a week or so ago in the later evening. We were glad that it was open but over all, were not very impressed by their coffee.  We found it to be bitter, and we both got their homemade syrups and they tasted.....off. The baristas were nice, however, and the atmosphere was almost deli-like with tables against the wall and big cases. Their chalk boards were well done and very beautiful. I'm giving three stars for great ambiance but the coffee could use some work. ", neutral 
Fat Cats Organic Coffee And Dessert ," 10/1/2016 1 check-in Service: friendly, funny, and attentive baristas!  Atmosphere: chill with a creative vibe and a everybody-knows-your-name kinda feeling.  Coffee: strong and satisfying. I asked for an extra shit of espresso in my small latte and the barista informed me that they put 2 shots standard in their small lattes. YES. Finally, a coffee shop that does it right. Bonus: a selection of syrups made in-house. Get the pumpkin!  I would've given it 5 stars, but I only went once during a trip to Austin. I'll be back, though! ", pos 
Fat Cats Organic Coffee And Dessert ," 10/22/2016 1 check-in I have to say this place is pretty good and they have a cute logo. Their double shot of espresso did the trick along their vegan waffles which actually tasted really good. It tasted lightweight as opposed to a non-vegan waffle. The barista will tell you the waffles will take 10 - 20 minutes to make. I had it with the coconut whipped cream and syrup. I'm pretty sure they had other toppings to offer but it was the only one that appealed to me. They had some ice cream, baked goods and waffles. You can have the waffles with ice cream, which I know is an ice cream cone but still sounds good nevertheless. Too bad it's a small place but it has a long bench against the wall with 5-6 tables. If I was living close by, I would come here more often. Vegan waffle with coconut whipped cream.

Fat Cats Organic Coffee And Dessert ," 8/3/2016 This place is adorable! I also appreciate the fact that they offer a lot of options as far as different types of baked goods, treats, and drinks goes. I'm not vegan but I did note that there are a lot of vegan options as well, some even looked tastier than their non-vegan counterparts.  The girls at the register were very helpful and friendly, although we had originally stopped in for coffee, the second they mentioned ice cream we had our faces pressed against the freezer glass faster than you can say fat cats. I opted for a scoop of their mint and lemon cookie, the lemon cookie is delicious and I would have dove into that freezer and ate the entire tub if they hadn't been watching.  The latte I ordered was yummy as well, I love that they create their own syrups so that you have the option of drinking a lavender flavored cup of goodness. Coffee shops take note; lavender is a win.  Thanks ladies, you're doing a great job! ", pos

Fat Cats Organic Coffee And Dessert ," 6/27/2016 6 check-ins Well after trying a cafe cubano at several coffee places, Fat Cats has my nod as my favorite.  This was the first coffee place I tried a cubano at, thought it was good but really didn't come to appreciate how good until ordering it at several other places and finding it just didn't compare.  The flavor is smooth with just the right amount of sweetness. Fats cats also has ice cream, waffles, donuts and cookies to satisfy your sweet tooth craving.   The Mexican chocolate donut is one of my favorites.  If you like Mexican chocolate with a hint of spicy, this is for you. They also have great teas. Seating is fairly limited, but I've never had an issue getting a table.  Parking is plentiful which is always nice.  It always appears to be clean inside.   Fat cats is definitely in my rotation of coffee shops. Hmmm Treat yourself El Guapo Espresso See all photos from Charles Y. for Fat Cats Organic Coffee And Dessert ", pos 
Fat Cats Organic Coffee And Dessert ," 8/13/2016 4 check-ins HOLY CANOLI AM I ALLOWED TO SAY THIS IS THE BEST COFFEE I HAVE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE..BECAUSE IT IS.  If you can't tell..I would 10/10 recommend this place. THREE WORDS: coffee ice cubes. That's right people, say goodbye to watered down iced coffee that tastes awful after 15 minutes in the Texas heat. This is revolutionary.  I am not sure how I first heard of Fat Cats but I believe they sell their vegan pastries at other places around town but it was when my friend told me about the COFFEE ICE CUBES when I got in my car and sped right there. After I picked up the iced coffee (an almond milk vanilla iced latte to be exact) I even got out of the car to run an errand and the coffee still tasted delicious instead of watered down grossness. Yum yum yum, new favorite coffee shop! And it's cat themed so right up my alley. ", pos 
Fat Cats Organic Coffee And Dessert ," 5/14/2016 1 check-in I was hoping for a lot better experience.  Location/ atmosphere: It's a really really small shop. Pretty limited seating and the tables are tiny and chairs are really awkward to sit in. I came in with two other friends and we sort of sat down (two on the long chairs and me on a smaller chair)- all sort of seated to a tiny table. My first thought when I walked in was ""Is this it??"" Bc the place is just kind of a long so all the tables and seats are all next to each other with not much space. I was glad when we came in it wasn't busy and not very packed because it'd be awkward to have strangers sit so close to you. Overall, small tables with not much room for much. Wouldn't come here for studying or a big group.  Desserts: I came around 7 or 8pm and I don't know if they ran out throughout the day but I didn't see much pastry selection. It was a small display case and no more. So we moved onto the ice cream- which they had a big selection of (Both Vegan and Dairy). They let you try out the flavors with a metal spoon so don't be scared to ask! We each got a flavor (Coconut, Lemon cookies, and the strawberry) and it was pretty good but nothing to really say ""YEAH THAT WAS SPECIAL I'm definitely coming back again!!"" I wish I had tried their coffee (now seeing really great things about their coffee ice cubes).  Service: It was alright. We got served and got stamp cards but I don't think I'll ever come here 10 more times to fill up that card. It'd have been nice if she made some recommendations to what's pretty popular in the store when she saw us squinting at the menu and looking around the shop all indecisive.  Overall, an average place- but disclaimer: I'm not a vegan!! So I guess the people who are.. really appreciate this place! Stawberry Lemon cookies and Coconut icecream (all dairy) ", neutral

They offer gf ice cream cones (sugar and regular cones) and a variety of gf cookies.  I got the gf chocolate chip and almond milk chai. The chai takes a few minutes to make since they brew to order.  It was pretty good but was a little heavy on the cinnamon and ginger side for my liking. The gf cookie though!  Yummy!  Just the right amount of chocolate chips and chewy, my fav quality.

There are plenty of organic coffee/espresso/tea options for whatever you happen to be in the mood for, be it a standard black coffee, a latte, macchiato, cafe au lait, or a variety of brewed teas, they make it! They also have a variety of different syrups made in-house that can be added to any brew.  There are also a variety of desserts available to satisfy any sweet tooth. These range from cookies and donuts to mini pies and ice cream (both dairy and vegan versions). I've had a few of their ice creams (both versions) and have loved every flavor I've tried. You can also ask for a spoonful to try if you can't decide!  The atmosphere is cozy, the wifi satisfactory and the employees are super nice. Great place to visit! ", pos 
Fat Cats Organic Coffee And Dessert ," 8/5/2016 1 check-in I love Fat Cats.  I work way too close to it so I must exercise some restraint.  I admit I haven't had much of the food there. I typically have tea, of which they have an incredible variety, or an almond milk latte which is always made with care and served in a nice big mug. On a particularly hot day I enjoyed an Italian soda which they were kind enough to make less sweet for me because I'm a big baby with stuff that's too sweet.  The servers/baristas are both kind and knowledgeable. Especially with tea. When I stare blankly at their impressive menu they are quick to help with welcome suggestions. It's wonderful that they have so many allergen and vegan-diet friendly options and that they do their best to offer organic items. Wish more places would follow in their footsteps with those initiatives.  Get a punch card!  One thing I wish they would re-consider or invest in if the opportunity comes would be wall outlets and comfier seating. I would love to hang out here and study/work/read. I'd be motivated (for better or worse) to purchase more stuff there because you can't sit in front of all those treats for very long without convincing yourself you need one.  I'm not deducting a star because the point of the layout may indeed have been to discourage people staying around. I have worked in food establishments where we preferred to push people out after a bit. But, I think the beauty of coffee shops is that it can be a place to get away from home and hang for a bit, so I'd certainly do that at Fat Cats if it were an option. ", pos

They make a great traditional chai (warning: it takes about 10 minutes). The place is cute, and every time I go they're adding more to the atmosphere. There are always a few folks seated; working and enjoying coffee.  Honestly, I'm not a huge fan of the coffee they brew - the flavor seems off for me. (I'm one of those horrible people that likes the Starbucks flavor). But where they get me are the baked goods (most/all are vegan I believe).

Fat Cats Organic Coffee And Dessert ," 11/10/2015 1 check-in Just moved near this location so I had to check it out. And I'm glad I did!  Now, I could never be vegan (I love all types of food waaaay too much), but this place had me thinking I could change my ways. Everything in their display case looked delicious and all of it was either gluten free, vegan, or organic. They also have vegan icecream! So, if you qualify as one of those things check this place out for the desserts  Let's move onto the coffee! My iced coffee was probably one of the best I've had in this city. It was delicious and I was able to get it with soy (any type of milk you could possibly think of, I would bet they have) for free of charge. Also they make their own sweeteners which are also organic and delicious. The coolest part of my iced coffee was that they used ice cubes that are made out of frozen coffee (genius idea. why don't more places do this??) so the coffee flavor was not watered down at all. Also, a nice bonus was that after finishing my drink I let the ice cubes melt and had a second iced coffee. It was like getting a free refill which made my cheap self very excited.  The only reason I can't give this place 5 stars is due to their latte.  We ordered the pumpkin spice latte (#basic #fall) and it was not as amazing as my iced coffee. There was a lot of foam and the pumpkin spice flavor was a little lackluster.  However, living in Texas, it's pretty much warm year round so I don't need hot drinks to make me sweat even more than I do. I'll stick to the iced coffee here and be the happiest and most caffeinated person in the world.  Definitely try this place out!

It was like 6 bucks. The service was quick. Then again, there were 2 girls behind the counter and only a couple other patrons there. The wifi was fast.  Loses one star. Why?

Fat Cats Organic Coffee And Dessert ," 12/29/2015 Pretty adorable little spot in an albeit unsuspecting location. We stopped here the other night for some vegan ice cream after dinner. I was glad that the lady was willing to provide a few samples for me since I hadn't been there before. I ordered from the vegan side, which is all Coconut Bliss coconut milk ice cream. Ordered a half and half scoop, which was awesome, since I didn't want to do two scoops just to get two flavors. Not all places are that accommodating.  They'd already put the baked goods away, which seems like poor business to me. My brother, who goes frequently, said that's common practice for them to empty out the bakery case hours before closing. The woman said if there was anything we wanted, she could get it from the back, but it's hard to know what I want if I can't see it: the texture, the size, the potential for deliciousness entreating me to spend more money. I hope they'll reconsider this practice in the future.  Also of note: loyalty cards. My brother got a punch for each of us, and I got mint chocolate chip. Score. ", pos 
Fat Cats Organic Coffee And Dessert ," 12/23/2015 I happened by Fat Cats after a work lunch at Blackstar, and was feeling caffeineedy. I got a run of the mill iced latte with almond milk. The coffee is fantastic (I noticed that there is a daily roast card, and that they were out of some beans which is a plus in my book) and I was very pleased with how quickly it was made. It's also VERY reasonably priced.  On a whim, I decided to have it iced, and I am very glad I did. The ice is made with coffee instead of water. I'm thrilled! I am so excited this little cup is going to last me for more than the 30 minutes it would normally take to nurse it a little.  The reason it's a four instead of five star is because I like my coffee shops to feel a little less like frozen yogurt places (bright and sterile), more like a friend's house.  Excellent job, Fat Cats. I will make it a point to come back for dessert when I'm in less of a rush and will update my review! ", pos

We tried the banana nut loaf, decaf americanos, and the Mexican chocolate doughnut. -The banana nut bread was a *little* bit dry but very tasty, not-too-sweet, with really rich chocolate chips.   -The coffee was FANTASTIC.  Couldn't believe it was decaf.  (Also, awesome: it was about the same price as Starbucks, if not cheaper.  Hard to find great coffee for that price.) -For us, the highlight was the Mexican chocolate doughnut in combination with the coffee.  We both like spicy foods with our coffee so this was just right.  Like the bread, it wasn't too sweet but was SO perfectly chocolatey with a nice spiciness from cayenne pepper.  I'll be back for this!

Their coffee is Fair Trade. Iced coffee is a delicious cold brew and served with coffee ice cubes so it won't get watered down! Genius! Milk is from grass fed cows, or any kind of nondairy. Coffee syrups are home made.  I didn't get to try their baked goods because their oven was broken but I hear they will all be vegan.  They have a deluxe ice cream menu featuring 8 or 10 flavors each of vegan and dairy ice creams. The vegan ice cream is Coconut Bliss brand, not sure where they get the dairy version. They have organic toppings like vegan gummy bears and marshmallows. They even have a nondairy hot fudge and coconut whipped cream.  My only complaint is that the hot fudge serving is a bit skimpy. I went back and paid for a second serving to make it come out with my ice cream.  That may be a cost control issue, as it's clearly made with high quality chocolate. ", pos

Fat Cats Organic Coffee And Dessert ," 4/14/2016 This is a very nice coffee shop that is a good place to study/work and grab some organic/vegan snacks.  Things to know:  Pros - Good selection of vegan and non-dairy ice creams, as well as traditional ice cream. - Nice pastry/bakery options for vegans as well -  Square tables good for doing work at - Coffee is pretty good - Great selection of teas, which are also good - Super cute environment - parking directly outside storefront (2Hr spots)  Cons - no outlets for plugging in computers. (no biggie. Just charge your stuff before you come) - Small store, so could potentially get crowded easily. (It was not crowded when I went on a weekday afternoon) - Bench seating makes up half the seating of every table, as the bench and tables line one wall of the place. I didn't mind it because it wasn't busy, but you might end up smooshed up next to someone on a busy day.  What I got:  Matcha vegan baked donut: I actually really liked the donut. It was spiced really well and very moist. Very cake-like. The matcha is in the icing, which does have a good matcha flavor, but is also very, very sweet. It was too sweet for me to finish the donut. But if you love super-sweet icing you'll probably like the donut overall.  Latte with almond milk. Really good. Very strong dark roast flavor.  Scoop of Vegan Ginger cookie ice cream and scoop of regular Cardamom flavor ice cream. both were delicious!  Sun, Moon, and Stars iced green tea. Very pleasant.  And I just loved seeing all the little touches in decor like the black bowler hat light shades.  Overall, I really liked it there. The night manager, Ariel, was tending the place the afternoon that I went and she was very nice and personable.  I'll definitely be going back. The bar to the left of the ice creams. Matcha Donut.

Got a Belgian Waffle with 1 scoop Sea Salted Caramel Ice Cream and 1 scoop Butterscotch Pecan Ice Cream. The shop prides itself in having vegan and gluten-free items, which didn't really matter to me but others would appreciate. The waffle was great, it had a hint of cinnamon which really added to the flavor. The waffle was nicely crisp on the outside to hold onto and balance the ice cream, with an airy and fluffy inside. The ice cream was delicious (the flavors we got were made with dairy but they do offer dairy-free kinds) and really went well with the waffle.

Fat Cats Organic Coffee And Dessert ," 1/2/2016 Really happy with the service and quality. I come here pretty regularly, and the coffee is well made, the iced coffee cubes are genius. The baked goods and ice cream are lovely. I adore the drinking chocolate as well (ladies, if you're having an insatiable hormone driven chococraving this is the cure).  Definitely recommended.  I'm hoping they'll start doing custom cakes soon, as I have a wedding coming up.  ;) ", pos 
Fat Cats Organic Coffee And Dessert ," 5/28/2016 Listed in Austin Cafes: Coffee vs Community or Both! I appreciate that Crestview Station is mixed-used, with diverse retailers that are trying to up the development's cool factor, but the lack of character and characters here, and at Midtown Grocery, Black Star, et al., is what keeps me from becoming a regular at any of them. The interior of Fat Cats is sterile by design, but they've done a nice job establishing a living room vibe, with their bookcase, toys, games, and... lack of outlets. Yes, I will actually make that a point of praise! There aren't enough tables for someone to stake a claim for hours, and the desserts attract plenty of couples on dates, who want to sit down, albeit it briefly, to make an experience of it, which they deserve to because the menu is really creative and special. When I went, there actually was someone set up with her computer, so I had to have my single (not cat) lady date at home. A sour note on the menu, though, I think it is too big, and opted not to order a drink, being overwhelmed by the abundance of choice. However, the pastry selection is scaled back to protect against waste, and keep the case fresh and original, which I like a lot! ", neutral

They always have an above average variety of treats in the bakery case, and the coffee does not disappoint! They have vegan Belgian waffles and many flavors of non-dairy ice cream, both of which I am looking forward to trying (after which I will update my review)!! The baristas have been nothing but super pleasant too. Fat Cats hosts the perfect atmosphere for some Joe, a treat, and gossip with a friend! ", pos

Fat Cats Organic Coffee And Dessert ," 4/28/2016 This place was awesome. We went for the baked donuts and because their baked goods are vegan. They were out of most bakery items but keep in mind we went late in the evening.  We had cafe con leche, mexican snickerdoodle cookies and scones. Yum! The cafe was not true cuban coffee atleast not like I had in Miami. But it was still great coffee. The service was slow but very courteous and professional.  There was only one person working and seemed like everyone decided to all come at once.  The coffee is made to order so it does take longer but definitely worth the wait! ", pos 
Fat Cats Organic Coffee And Dessert ," 6/4/2016 i find that a cafe that serves a macchiato in the true way (espresso+foam) deserves a 3 stars on its own. barista was really attentive. tried the mexican chocolate donut, really nice and spiced very good addition to my macchiato. my friend got the mocha and get this, the ice is made from coffee! nice touch there guys, really loving the flavor profile of the mocha here. they got ice cream as well, both vegan and non-vegan. would come here again.

Fat Cats Organic Coffee And Dessert ," 12/9/2015 1 check-in Listed in Yummy in my Tummy I dropped my boyfriend off at the barber shop and was craving coffee. Yelp told me this was the closest coffee shop so I decided to give it a try. It was a little confusing to find the shop due to the location and parking is very minimal, but I made my second loop around and caught a car leaving and waited for their spot. When I walked in, I was the only customer there. I was assisted by a super friendly employee who gave me honest feedback on the dog treats instead of just trying to sell to me (I asked if they were hard since my dog refuses to eat hard dog treats and she said they are). I got two donuts (my sweet tooth was bigger than my stomach) and an iced caramel latte. Excuse my french, but it was all SEX IN MY MOUTH. I honestly think it was the best coffee drink I've ever had - and they even offer coffee ice cubes for iced drinks. I only ate one of the donuts but the sweet lady was nice enough to give me a to go box for the other one. I actually cried over the other donut cause my boyfriend ate it :'( DONUT JUDGE ME, they were that good!  The only thing I didn't like was that there was no outside seating, and the inside seating was kind of awkward. I was there by myself and the only customer there at the time, so I would've liked to sit outside. Best coffee I've had yet. ", pos

I go in with my laptop fully charged, knowing that I'll also find some delicious dairy-free breakfast options (if you haven't tried it yet, I *highly* recommend the Mexican chocolate donut!). They were even super helpful at crafting a delicious green tea with mint and honey for me when I was indecisive about what kind of drink I was looking for. Overall, I love love love this place. The only heads up I would give is that they do not have multiple outlets, so this would not be ideal for an all-day study place... but excellent if, like me, you sometimes want to keep yourself from working too much or make yourself take a break once your laptop battery is drained. :) ", pos

Can't wait to go back for coffee and other yummy treats! ", pos 
Fat Cats Organic Coffee And Dessert ," 11/9/2015 I am excited that my neighborhood coffee shop has great reviews so far, but unfortunately my experience has been slightly different. I came in several times right after they opened and each time was just lacking. The drinks took a really long time to make and the service was so... bland. They hit a low point when I went in with a friend one evening and we both ordered the chai tea - mine with almond milk and hers with regular milk. The girl at the counter called out that our drinks were ready and I went to grab them. Both were in mugs and I asked which was which. In response I got, ""Um, I think that's the almond."" So away we went. My friend and I were deep in conversation, enjoying our chai teas when the owner comes over and says, ""I think you're drinking the wrong ones."" She picked up each of our mugs, sniffed them, and says, ""Yep, you're drinking each other's..."" and proceeds to switch our mugs! Keep in mind we were halfway finished with our drinks at this point. It was a huge turnoff and just made for a really awkward moment--and they should thank their lucky stars that I'm not lactose intolerant or vegan... or a really mean Yelper.  I was going to write this review a few weeks ago, but seeing as they are fairly new and growing pains are normal and expected, I decided to give them another shot... and I can say that they are really improving.  Some good stuff: Coffee ice cubes. Great idea and I wish more coffee shops would do this. The coffee and tea menus are huge and include stuff you don't see in every coffee shop: cafe cubano, cortadito, traditional indian chai, etc. Homemade syrups are also a plus as well as their selection of vegan ice cream, dairy ice cream, and baked goods. I have not gotten around to trying the treats yet, but they look pretty good. Service also seems to have improved. Kelsey was super friendly and made my friend and I feel very welcome last week. The espresso drinks have been a bit on the weak side but good nonetheless. ", neutral 
Fat Cats Organic Coffee And Dessert , 10/9/2015 Stopped by here  while on a work trip and got a hot chocolate. I don't do regular dairy and they were really accommodating - offered multiple alternatives. The result was delicious! It was just enough sweet and just enough rich. The ice cream selection looked fantastic  and I wish I could have indulged in it! The atmosphere was conducive for conversations with friends or to just do work. Wish there was a place like this near where I live! , pos

Your patience is rewarded with home-baked scones and muffins, home-made ice cream toppings and home-made waffle cones.  All of it is organic.  All of it served by friendly staff with a smile.  They have loyalty cards; get one because you will need it.  They have plenty of ice cream flavours and give out free samples if you ask.  Some flavours are vegan-friendly.  The music isn't too loud and they have some fantastic decor.  Attention to detail in this regard is spectacular.  By using Third Coast Coffee Roaster's beans Fat Cats is supporting a local business.  They have free wifi; use it to write a Yelp review.  I wish this local business the best for the future. ", pos

Can't wait to try the waffles next time. ", pos 
Fat Cats Organic Coffee And Dessert ," 12/9/2015 I love this place! The baked vegan donuts are delicious and have a great texture. The coffee is the best that I've had in this city to date. My favorite part, however, is the tea menu. They have a wide selection of teas that can be ordered by the cup or pot. I've been to plenty of coffee shops where they simply put a tea bag in hot water which is so wrong! Not here! They take the time to make a proper pot of tea with the correct temperatures and time for the type of tea. Finally! An affordable pot of tea made properly. I'm in heaven. The place is clean, bright, and quiet. If I lived closer I would visit daily, but I am happy that I can go in the weekends. I plan to try the waffles and ice cream next. Happy to see more delicious vegan options in this city. ", pos

This is the adult version of the Baskin Robbins that was so popular as a kid.  The only reason why I didn't give it more stars was the limited seating and lack of outlets.  This could be due to the fact that the free parking is limited to two hours, however the quality of the food/drink offerings would attract customers willing to stay here and consume things all afternoon.  I'll definitely be coming back to get work done and have another cherry pie a la mode. ", pos

Not only did they have non dairy options (soy,almond AND coconut), the owner who took my order also recommended the one that would taste the best.  I am a little bit of a chai snob and can't handle the powders or concentrated mixes that you find at most places around town.  This is the real deal.  I can't wait to go back for some dessert!

Epoch Coffee ," 10/24/2016 1 check-in Listed in 2016 Yelp 100, The Sweet Spots!, Coffee Shops with Latte Art 24/7 coffee shop that offers great coffee, spacious and plenty of seating option, along with yummy snack bites!!! Why can't we have something like this in DFW already??? Maybe they're not ready for people like me who would definitely ""camp"" out over night at their coffee shop if there was one in Dallas :(  After our late dinner, I wanted something sweet, surprise, not. Checking out at least couple new coffee shops while in Austin was also on my to do list. Epoch was only about 10mins from where we were at, and stays open 24/7 made it the perfect pick.  It took us a few minutes looking for a parking spot in their small lot. We gave up and decided to park on the street, ur best option. The coffee shop was packed at almost 11pm on a Thursday night, not too big of a surprise since it's not far from UT, swamped with night owls was completely understandable.  We each got a hazelnut latte. I was a lil disappointed to see somewhat of crappy latte art on both, but the delicious, smooth latte made up for it, along with their delicious strawberry rhubarb pie, making my first experience with rhubarb pie a great one.  We would have stayed here longer if the mosquitoes didn't like me too much and started munching on me. First coffee shop on my list for this Austin trip was a win and a success in my book, regardless of the disappointing latte art, I'm definitely looking forward to the next time coming back here! Strawberry rhubarb pie. So good! Hazelnut latte. No real latte art :( Hazelnut latte with almond milk. Great coffee! ", pos 
Epoch Coffee ," 11/22/2016 This is a great coffee shop to post up for a marathon work session - it's got lots of tables, outlets, and other people who are also working who are willing to share those tables and outlets with you. It's busy pretty much constantly, but I've never not been able to find a spot to sit down! The coffee is decent, the latte art is pretty, and it's got a cool atmosphere.  I do have some qualms with this place, though, namely the staff. I get that not everyone is into the whole ""service with a smile"" thing, and that's totally okay with me! But I shouldn't feel like I'm inconveniencing you every time I order something. Generally, I get an annoyed look while I order and have been treated like I'm dumb every time I ask a question. Not really what I'm looking for in a coffee shop, and I've stopped coming here as much because of the service. (Especially when Brentwood Social House just opened up down the road and the service and seating are excellent.)  I also really dislike that the ""smoking"" and ""non-smoking"" sections of their side patio. Because we all know smoke travels with air, unless they put a wall between the two sections it really does nothing to prevent being bombarded with cigarette smoke. Smokers, I've got nothing against you personally, but you smell bad and I want to be able to sit outside without increasing my risk of lung cancer. Just sayin'. ", neutral

The service is very quick.  Best of all they are open 24 hours so you never have to worry that they might be closed which is one of my pet peeves about other coffee shops in town.

SH$%. How hard guys? That's all- I recommend going at 3-4am, there may be one or two seats available...  ***UPDATE end***  Reason #1: They are open 24/7 Reason #2: They have GREAT coffee.  It's not like they have a ton of options or make world changing coffee, but it is really really good and consistent. Mojo is strong but tasty and the Mexican Mocha is my go to... Reason #3: They have a good sized patio Reason #4: There is this attractive creepy feeling about the place that makes you just wanna go get coffee there like every day...it may be the State Mental hospital cemetery across the parking lot...maybe not...maybe it's their shrine tip candles...  Interlude: I just read Sean C's review and almost spit out my drink laughing...it's true though, it does seem like there's people that look like they've been there for seven days and seven nights and have used the dingy bathroom for a bird bath session.  And I have seen the boxes and boxes of pizza they stack in their fridge's to sell to people, but I don't eat at Epoch, I go for coffee...but I see it as a courtesy...they're like, yeah some people may get hungry sitting here we can provide some noms for the hungry etc.  I don't use the internet here, I use my own hotspot so I don't know if it's good for working...I assume that the internet is good considering 95% of the people there sipping on coffee are on their laptops.

Epoch is perfect for those in need of caffeination. I kept things simple with a 16oz coffee with half and half, but that coffee was definitely expertly brewed. Every drop was definitely worth savoring. My coffee's companion of a blueberry muffin was excellent as well.  The staff were kind and quick with good service.

Epoch Coffee ," 6/26/2016 2 check-ins I enjoy this little coffee shop. It's located in a little unassuming strip mall with a records store and vintage clothing boutique. The coffee shop itself is fairly large on the inside (for a coffee shop), with a few board games for patrons to play and a random assortment of chairs and couches for people to sit on. There's free wifi and a patio in case you'd like to bring your dog. The patio is separated into a smoking and non-smoking section, so you get to enjoy being outdoors without being bombarded with smoke if you wish. I've only ever gotten the iced coffee, which comes in a large glass that can be refilled for $2. Service has always been quick. There are a variety of other coffee/espresso options on the menu as well as different milks (dairy and non-dairy) that can be added. ", pos 
Epoch Coffee ," 3/18/2016 2 check-ins Pretty clutch 24 hour coffee/pizza place in north Austin, I got the olivia slice one night, and the moon walker slice the other, and a chocolate chip cookie, all were really good, im glad they had the moon walker which was white sauce as you don't see that all the time, I'd have loved to try the coffee but it was 2am each time and might not have been the best idea :p hopefully i can try it next time i'm back!

Epoch Coffee ," 8/20/2016 Chill atmosphere, and a great place to go if you happen to be up late. Love that it's open 24/7!  The drink selection isn't my favorite in Austin, but I still think it's pretty good. Great place to study! ", pos 
Epoch Coffee ," 1/17/2016 7 check-ins I love being in walking distance of Epoch. I'm not the biggest coffee drinker, so you may wonder why I bother coming here. I am a huge fan of green tea and the peppermint iced green tea is definitely awesome.  I have had the mojo and found it delicious as well.  I love the atmosphere. Inside is cozy and typically has some good music playing (sometimes a little too loudly, but oh well) and outside is a great spot to people watch and enjoy good weather. The staff is friendly and quick. Overall one of my favorite spots on North Loop ", pos

Epoch Coffee ," 10/12/2015 1 check-in 4.5 stars but rounding up since they are open 24/7!! MOJO = DELICIOUS COFFEE. We came in on a Sunday morning for a coffee, and encountered this gigantic coffee shop with plenty of indoor and outdoor seating (you can bring your dogs!). Since the mojo is pre-sweetened, and made with dairy, I decided to play it safe by ordering a 1/2 Iced Mojo, 1/2 Iced Coffee ($4, yelp.com/user_local_phot…), which was perfect- it wasn't too sweet, and my occasional lactose intolerance didn't kick in. This is highly recommended since it had a great smooth/creamy texture. I would definitely come back just for this. The parking lot is big so parking in the larger back lot shouldn't be an issue- however, the front parking spots that are closer to the entrance fill up quickly. 1/2 Iced Mojo, 1/2 Iced Coffee ($4) ", pos 
Epoch Coffee ," 4/13/2016 4 check-ins I was craving a Mexican mocha from Epoch so had to stop by before work. I bought a coffee to go and a bagel for about $6. Not Bad. This place is open 24/7 so I never have to worry if I'm too early. It smells so good once you enter. There's nothing like walking into an aroma of coffee and sweets, just a bunch of healthy goodness.

Epoch Coffee ," 11/18/2015 10 check-ins My roommate loves to study at coffee shops, so I tend to tag along when she invites me. Epoch is conveniently located near where we live, so when it's possible, we walk there. The parking lot gets pretty crowded (typical Austin), and nothing is more of a deterrent from studying than when parking becomes frustrating.  I've never been to Epoch in the day time just because I tend to study better in the evening. It's always a gamble whether I'll find a table or not when I get there because Epoch is always busy at night (yay 24 hour coffee shop!). Pounce on a table when you spy someone packing up to leave.  The wifi here is pretty dependable. Though I have a sneaky suspicion that they'll turn off the wifi (and crank the AC up) to get rid of customers around midnight. I've made it past the point of no wifi and freezing temperatures (around 1AM), and I can affirm that they do turn the wifi back on.  The coffee is decent and will tide you through studying, but nothing really stands out to me. I'd highly recommend the chocolate cake though. They give you a large slice, and it's rich and moist.  Service is alright. It meets my standard of hipster coffee shop service. ", neutral 
Epoch Coffee ," 4/4/2016 This is succccchhh a cool coffee shop. Outside seating, indoor vintage interior and furniture. I love it. I grabbed an ice coffee and chilled outside. It was lovely.

Epoch Coffee ," 6/4/2016 1 check-in Listed in Austin, TX Great place to study. An abundant amount of tables inside and out. Wifi was pretty fast given the amount of people there. Plenty of outlet space. This place is really unique in that aspect. However I can see it getting filled up pretty quick. I was there before 8 and already more than half of the inside was full.  Espreesso and food were not...great. I felt the espresso tasted really burnt. The breakfast wrap was ok. There are not a lot of food options nor variety. Would not come here for eating or drinking.

Epoch Coffee ," 9/17/2016 By far my favorite coffee house in Hyde Park and the surrounding area. Open 24/7 and inhabited by easygoing, down to earth people (customers and staff alike), Epoch provides ample seating (indoor and out-), places to plug-in, and free, strong-signal wifi. However, it can get quite busy, at times, making finding a seat a challenge sometimes. The food and goodie selection is better than average, and includes various yummy vegan offerings. The coffee snob in me gives their coffee products a 7/10--which is good, just not great--and I wish their coffee menu were a little more extensive. However, those are just minor gripes. Epoch is definitely a quality establishment worth patronizing. ", pos

Epoch Coffee ," 1/26/2016 When I moved to Austin in 2011, I set out to find a good coffee shop. A good coffee place is like a solid base of operations. You can use it to do your taxes, meet someone new, play chess, drink coffee, design a scale model Smurfs village, read a book.  But a truly outstanding coffee shop has a consistently friendly and genuinely kind staff that seems like family. That's really what I get every time I go to Epoch.  Being the introvert-extrovert, I know the staff all recognize my face and none probably know me by name (that's my fault). And those people make the place shine. They of course represent the eclectic and interesting tastes of the Austin community and I would expect nothing less.  Fantastic music plays in the background at all hours. Local artists get display space on the walls. The same guys come in and play four-way chess every Sunday. There's a guy named John who's always there. It's like Cheers but with ACC students and a table in the back that seems to attract Tinder first dates.  There's plenty of indoor and outdoor seating: sofas, large cushioned chairs, wooden chairs, stools. There are pull-down electrical outlets for the tables away from the walls. There's indoor wifi. There's also a little mini deli by the cash register with sandwiches, wraps, muffins, cookies. They serve coffee, kombucha, tea, and you can even order a pizza. No one will go hungry here.  There's a strange air about the place. It feels a bit vulnerable, like home. When I walk in on any given day, whether it's after I've rowed on the lake or had a long day at work, I always feel like I could meet someone new (and I often do) and form an instant real connection.  It's just a good place. Check it out. ", pos 
Epoch Coffee ," 9/2/2016 1 check-in I have nothing bad to say about this place. The coffee and teas are great. The customers are a mix of students, hipsters, locals, and poets that are left of center. Very relaxed place. Steady stream of customers, but I have never experienced an unreasonably long wait. Great stop during the day. ", pos 
Epoch Coffee ," 8/1/2015 1 check-in I was visiting a friend in Austin and Epoch was right across the street so I thought I'd check it out and get some work in for a couple hours. I'm not a big coffee drinker so you should be asking yourself why is he here but I was happy to see they have smoothies. I went with the Pineapple Paradise and yes it was paradise in my mouth. I'm not really sure what was in it other than pineapple but I'm not complaining! They also have pizza by the slice and I went with the white pizza (it has a crazy name which I can't remember). Solid and thin crust but a little pricey at $3.25 or $3.75 a slice...my memory is escaping me.  Maybe because the sightseeing at Epoch is spectacular. Hipsters galore in all assortments of ridiculous outfits. Even a girl with armpit hair, hooray! You will not be disappointed trust me. This is better than sightseeing at the airport or your local Walmart. ", pos

Okay let me write this review which needs to be written. My God, I haven't been here before. It was raining in Austin and instead of staying home, I developed a case of cabin fever which you might think is the worst time to get it. Usually when it rains, it's unsafe to drive in this weather. I decided to brave the elements and decide to go out. I'm glad I did. Parking can be a nuisance but I was fortunate to find parking in their parking lot. When I enter where every table is full of people studying and working on their laptops. Service was great and I had some of their iced coffee. There was plenty of outside seating which I didn't mind sitting because I love watching the rain. A big plus was when they were playing Jesus and the Mary Chain. It doesn't get any perfect. ", pos 
Epoch Coffee ," 2/19/2016 6 check-ins The vibe of epoch, the furniture, the lighting - all very cool. I'm just not a big fan of their espresso.

Epoch Coffee ," 12/5/2014 14 check-ins Epoch is my FAVORITE spot to hang out in Austin. It is an artsy, eclectic, WEIRD art gallery, coffee shop, wireless mecca. You can post up all day and get some work done, hang out with a friend, enjoy a date, read a good book, or just chill out on the lovely outdoor deck. The beverage selection is SUPERB.  The hubby and I have claimed two well-broken in chairs as our own and are thrilled when they are both available, as it gets quite busy over at Epoch what with all of the students frequent this haunt.  The people watching at Epoch is a hobby in its own right!  It's a perfect microcosm for the city, attracting people of all ages and creeds. As I'm not a coffee person, I usually enjoy a Caramel Italian Cream Soda or a delicious Mexican Hot Chocolate with whipped cream while my husband sips on a double espresso.    My favorite thing about Epoch is the Peewee Herman doll sitting high above all of us minions looking down upon us with benevolence.  One really interesting fact about is that Epoch as a Geocache hidden on its premises!  If you are new to geocaching, this is a cool one to start with.

Epoch Coffee ," 3/15/2015 1 check-in First time here and I'm not overly impressed. I came with two other people and they seem to have the same sentiment. Atmosphere is nice, even though the music can be way too loud. Coffee and drinks are ok; we liked the Mexican Hot Chocolate. The staff did not care one bit that we were there. They're pretty sub par actually, and gave us an attitude.  Seems like an ok place to study, but it's more of a hipster cliche than anything. Meh.  Shoutout to the barista with tape on his glasses: you're a barista, you make coffee. You're not a distinguished artist or playwright so please smile, take yourself less seriously, and remove the obstruction from your bowels that's affecting your service. ", neutral 
Epoch Coffee ," 4/14/2016 While not being a coffee drinker, I have extremely high praise for this coffee house. Nestled into a quiet North Loop neighborhood, their copious amount of seating (and power outlets), speedy wifi, and incredibly friendly staff makes this place a hidden gem. I ordered their Moon Tower pizza slice (since I forgo coffee) and it was very tasty - hand prepared after I ordered - not some pre-packaged cold alternative. Overall, a very big fan and will be returning! ", pos 
Epoch Coffee ," 6/25/2016 My wife and I are regulars here. We almost always order the Mexican Mocha, although we've tried the teas, mojo, and iced coffee and all were good. 4/5 times the coffee is perfect and definitely a favorite. Unfortunately, every now and then the milk is not hot enough which completely kills the mocha for me.  In the mornings, they also sell tacos, the Princess Leia is my favorite. Even though they are not made there, they are always warm.  This location in particular is often full, so we normally take it to go. However, we love to sit in when they are not as packed.  Definitely recommend it! ", pos 
Epoch Coffee ," 2/6/2015 3 check-ins Listed in a latte love There's pretty much only two main twenty-four seven coffee houses in Austin for students to pull those dreaded all-nighters: Bennu and Epoch. Each has their own little charm although the one thing they have in common is the dark and [slightly] cozy atmosphere (...sometimes) and the overcrowded parking lots and even more overcrowded unavailable seats.  I go to Epoch a lot. In memory of all those late-night study moments and even later nights catching up with old friends, Epoch has become an honorary friend. How could a friend rank any lower than four stars? Epoch has kept me going far too often for me to actually think it's any less.  But let's go with the truth on this review:  I do like Epoch. I wouldn't go if I didn't like it at least a little. Their coffee is aight, and I stay awake for the most part. Personally, I've gone far past immune on caffeine alone and only stay alive with the help of loads of sugar, so the only thing that really helps me is their sweet mochas.  But to be honest--their coffee, as I've said only a moment ago, is simply... simply aight. From their black coffee to their lattes to their mochas and even their special (the Iced Mojo), if I were thinking of coffee alone, I wouldn't actually say Epoch serves the best or my favorite.  I don't really like the Iced Mojo--not even the half. I think it tastes like watered down coffee and sweetener. Their regular coffee isn't bad. I think it's better than Bennu's--at least their late night servings, anyway. It's a little on the sour side of coffee, if anyone knows what I mean by that. Their flavored lattes are super sweet. It's kind of ridiculous how sweet they are. I like their mochas--they're sweet but on the richer side with a deeper undertone. I prefer the Mexican Mocha over the Dutch because it has a sweeter flavor to it.  Their music taste is quite a variety. Sometimes, it works while I study. Other times, it overpowers my music in the weirdest ways possible. I don't really need metal at 3 AM, thanks...  Service is a mix, depending on the day. I've had friendly baristas (usually the older ones), and I've had unfriendly baristas (usually the younger ones). Weird how that works, I guess.  Do I think Epoch is great? Not really. But I prefer it a lot more than Bennu's, and I can't give it any less of a rating because it has been so kind to all those terrible nights of studying...  So to 24/7 coffee houses. There only need be more of them. ", pos 
Epoch Coffee ," 7/28/2015 1 check-in I came here on the way to a canoeing trip and it was so early that I was dying for coffee to function.  I just ordered a regular coffee and whatever beans they use are amazing!  It had the flavor, the kick you need and I didn't feel bad parting with my money after the cup was empty.  I also loved the interior; not too fancy and inviting!  Also, super convenient to I-35 and more than enough parking!  They also have breakfast tacos that are really delicious and made to order!  You can't beat this for the price, quality and quick service on food and beverage items! ", pos

I never stuck around to enjoy the ambiance, but that's not Epoch's fault. It seems like a good place to crack open your laptop and get some work done, or catch up with an old friend.

Epoch Coffee ," 2/9/2015 1 check-in Expectations of a 24 hour Austin coffee shop: 1). Super hipster barista--met by enthusiastic bearded fellow with long hair and a ""bike shop"" (based on overheard convo with other customers) and stray dogs he feeds 2) Tons of people writing next 50 Shades or developing next Pay Pal--met by tons of people plugged into the nifty overhead reel cords (like you'd have in your garage or shop) 3) eclectic decor--met by bathroom (see my photo) 4) Smokers consuming many types of product--met by numerous outdoor patrons (note to guy probably smoking weed--pay attention to wind direction--you must not be a hunter--sitting ""up front"" would have been more undercover!!) 5) And, oh by the way, coffee!--met by lovely drink I had. 6) snacks--the reason I'm only giving 4 stars--they had nothing gluten free except maybe breakfast tacos which were already pretty much sold out by my time of arrival. I did not ask about these--if they were corn tortilla, then they would qualify. But would it be too much trouble to toss a macaroon into the pastry case?   Great place to hang out and get something done. Huge indoor and outdoor seating--right near a little stream. Classy restroom graffiti. Mocha art ", pos

Epoch Coffee ," 2/17/2016 As a college student and avid coffee drinker (go figure), I've been trying to find some new coffee shops for a good study sesh. After reading some of the reviews here, I had high hopes for this place. I read such good things about the Mojo and, not being too crazy about super sweet drinks, I went with 1/2 Mojo, 1/2 Iced Coffee. I was hoping for something along the lines of a Summer Moon or a strong coffee flavor with smooth cream. Maybe it's because I got half, but I was pretty let down. First, it tasted watered down, like adding nonfat milk to weak coffee. Second, it tasted artificially sweetened. If you're a Starbucks person who gets iced coffee with nonfat milk, no classic, and a couple Splendas (I have credible Starbucks knowledge, trust), then the 1/2 Mojo is your cup of tea, rather, coffee. I'm not sure I want to spend about $4 to try a normal Mojo. ALSO..the guy at the register seemed like the type of guy who would often rub people the wrong way (no, not literally, you nasty. JK). At first, they forgot to add our bagel dog (tastes alriiiight) to our order, an honest mistake. Then, after waiting probably a good 20 minutes, turns out no one put it in the oven. Understandable if they were super busy, but there were maybe 2 other customers waiting.  Now, the study experience. Wi-Fi is great. I have yet to experience any internet failure. They even have separate wifis for inside and outside. They have a number of tables and comfy looking couches and chairs. Unfortunately, the spot my friend and I chose had loose outlets so our plugs wouldn't stay connected. It's fine though, nothing a rubberband couldn't fix. Points for that Asian ingenuity! Okay, so it's 73 degrees outside and I'm kind of freezing in here. If you plan on staying for a while and you don't know how the study-at-a-coffee-shop thing goes, a jacket is a necessity. (I left mine in the car, stupid me) Which brings me to the parking lot, which actually isn't too bad. I was fortunate enough to find an open spot in the filled lot right when I turned in. But the lot is pretty big, so I wouldn't worry TOO much.  All in all, this place isn't bad, but probably won't be my go-to study spot. This is my first review, so don't totally take my word for it, but I've had my fair share of coffee shop experiences. You kind of have to get a feel of this place yourself. ", neutral 
Epoch Coffee ," 2/14/2016 I love the atmosphere of Epoch -- very hipster and cozy. The main reason I drive so far to study at Epoch is because they're open 24/7. Their Mexican mocha is also superb. The only thing that bothers me is their rude staff. I've had multiple occurrences where the staff is not only unfriendly, but also very apathetic and borderline rude towards customers. It almost feels like they're put out to have you there or service you. Not every single employee has been rude, but the general vibe of the staff is completely disinterested and bothered by the needs of their customers. ", neutral 
Epoch Coffee ," 1/8/2015 Listed in My Fix, Second Home Epoch is one of the quintessential 24-hour Austin coffee shops, so you can imagine plenty of late nights that I've spent here. The indoor space actually isn't particularly large, but there's way more outside seating than Bennu - a blessing when the weather is cooperating; a curse at most times of the year.  I'm not the biggest fan of Epoch's drinks, but I have to give it up for the Mexican chocolate mocha - that hint of spiciness really makes a memorable drink that outclasses plenty of other coffee shops' drinks.  The atmosphere at Epoch is actually quite conducive to studying; in the multiple times that I've been, the music wasn't too overbearing, but there have been occasions that it gets a little too rowdy - no worries, pop your headphones on/in, and you'll be good to go. Parking is ok; when the lot is full, it's a sign that inside will be crammed, too.  Of course, since Epoch is 24/7, the shop will get pretty packed, and the wifi is periodically not-so-good, which could probably contribute to productivity. I still prefer Bennu, but I've spent some great nights at Epoch, and that Mexican chocolate mocha - let me tell you, it puts up a fight. ", pos

Epoch Coffee ," 11/23/2014 51 check-ins I love coffee. All coffee. Cheap coffee, fancy coffee. French press and 7 Eleven. Epoch is not about the coffee. It is about the coffee house. Their coffee is fine, I usually get a black eye, but don't go for the coffee. Don't go for the food -- excluding the bageldogs, I often kick my morning off with them. But really you go for more than acceptable coffee and over-salted snacks.  Go for the Austin. Epoch is often what Austin is. Youngish, energetic/caffeinated, high speed internet, listening to music that you haven't heard of and reading books that seem deep, or are required by UT courses.  Epoch has flaws -- but go get some caffeine, take a book that makes you look interesting and people watch your afternoon away. Graffiti at epoch. Epoch set up, red eye, bagel dog and code. ", pos 
Epoch Coffee ," 8/7/2015 3 check-ins This is a fun place to sit back, have a beverage, browse the net and hipster watch. I really enjoy the collection of people that congregate here, it makes the place vibrant and unique. It's not at all like a sterile coffee shop trying to be cool (rhymes with Barstucks)  This place is the real deal. It's next to a great vintage clothing and record shop too, so plan on spending some time in the area. The parking can get a little hectic at busy times, but that's just part of the charm. ", pos 
Epoch Coffee ," 4/17/2016 My husband and I have started coming here every weekend. Their coffee is amazing. I love iced coffee, but I like to sweeten it myself; they have simple syrup out for use so I get it PERFECT EVERY TIME!  Free wifi and plugs hang from the ceiling--this place rocks. ", pos 
Epoch Coffee ," 7/16/2015 1 check-in Listed in Austin Cafes Epoch is an ideal place to take out-of-towners for a taste of Austin's coffee culture. The patio is vibrant, the crowd is super interesting and friendly, and the drinks are tasty. I will say that even though it has tons of seating/outlets and is open late night, I wouldn't recommend it for getting work done. Especially if you're like me and can't focus when the table next to you is playing Cards Against Humanity and/or AC/DC is playing in the background. (This exact scenario happened to me last winter when I made the mistake of trying to study for a final here on a Friday night. Lolz.)  So for after hours study sesh, Bennu is definitely a better bet. But if you want to hang out with friends on a Friday night like a normal person, this is about as good as it gets. ", pos 
Epoch Coffee ," 10/6/2013 1 check-in Epoch is a great place to study, read, or just have coffee. The atmosphere is very relaxed. I came here with a friend to study and stayed here for plenty of hours.  Pros: Great atmosphere, good location (close to campus), has plugs located through out the cafe, great selection of coffees and pastries (better than bennu in my opinion).  On my first trip here I asked the cashier if she would recommend for a drink for me, I was looking for something cold and sweet, she suggested the Mojo (only available at Epoch) and even gave me a sample. It was the perfect blend between something coffee/mocha/sweet, I loved it and it is go to drink every time. The ice they use in the drinks is the perfect, it has a texture between shaved and crushed ice.  They have a very nice selection of pastries, and I would have to recommend the cinnamon roll. It is the BEST cinnamon roll I have ever had, imagine a croissant with cinnamon sugar in-between its layers then rolled up, baked to perfection, topped with just the right amount of icing and then some. If you get the cinnamon roll be sure to ask them to heat it up or your experience will just not be the same.  They also allow you to keep an open tab at the cashier as long as you give them your card to hold on as collateral, just make sure you close your tab before 24 hours or else they will charge a 10% tip on top of your tab.  Cons: They keep their air condition on and running, this place is COLD, make sure you bring a jacket or your will end up freezing your pants off. (I love the cold, this place is even cold in my standards, but I like the cold, still bring a jacket). There is a smell in the restrooms that personally I have a hard time getting over. It smells, used and dirty, not to mention there is graffiti all over the walls, and not very stylish graffiti if I might add. Parking kinda sucks, but then again it sucks at almost every 24 hour place, on the upside I was able to find parking here a lot easier than at Bennu.  Overall, this is my new goto study spot around UT and will be coming very often. Best cinnamon roll ever! Make sure you ask to have it warmed up! ", pos 
Epoch Coffee , 8/3/2015 Relaxing atmosphere to hand with friends or do some studying. pastries and pizza are very good. There cinnamon bus are great as well.

Epoch Coffee ," 3/6/2016 This was one of the first coffee shops I experienced when I decided to attend school at UT Austin. A friend invited me out to check out the place while he was working on his dissertation. It was within walking distance. It didn't feel like any other coffee establishment I ever visited. Not only are there friendly baristas preparing drinks and food, it had such good vibes to the point where I immediately felt comfortable enough to take a short power nap on the couch next to my friend. I never recalled ever doing that in a public place in my life, and yet I felt so much at home. I was initially surprised by the variety of people you run into at this place. People were taking part in lively discussions and ideas while live music was playing in the background. There were several people playing chess outside. It was very enjoyable. ", pos

Epoch Coffee ," 1/18/2016 Overall, this place is awesome. Great coffee, great lattes, plenty of indoor and outdoor seating. The reason I am giving them four stars is because smoking is allowed outdoors on the deck. People can sit only two feet away from the entrance and smoke. There is another outdoor section just around the corner that doesn't allow smoking, BUT I personally think they should ban cigarettes on the property altogether. It is not healthy and of course not pleasant to be breathing in secondhand smoke while trying to enjoy your coffee. I hope they will take this in consideration. ", pos 
Epoch Coffee ," 12/13/2014 1 check-in I went to this place before it was cool, just like pretty much everyone else. I also tried the coffee before it was cool, and burned my mouth.

I went inside to get a quick bite to eat, and noticed this shop is very new (I've been to the one in North Austin at The Domain). This is a very nice coffee shop with ample seating and I noticed some working there as well. I wanted to share a review and encourage those visiting downtown for #ACLFest, #SXSW or Austin Convention Center conferences to stop by.

In addition to the 2-top tables that are great for getting work done, there are also three large, family-style tables and a long bar-top, so Apanas is also ideal for groups or dates. The staff are friendly, knowledgable, and attentive. The coffee itself is sourced directly from Nicaragua, where the owner himself traveled and hand-picked the beans. They also offer a selection of cold-pressed juices, craft beers, pastries, and meal items.  The food and drink are top notch quality. The staff are wonderful. If you're looking for a quiet and open coffeeshop to study, a small meeting place, or an unassuming beer, this is your place! ", pos 
Apanas Coffee & Beer ," 9/26/2016 The food for lunch is okay but far from great. To my knowledge they just bring in sandwiches from another Austin eatery and reheat it. The beer selection is craft only and starts at $5-6 per beer. I also tried an iced coffee and it was okay, but very expensive. It was $1.50 more than the same iced coffee at Dominican Jos down the block but half the size. Working nearby, I'm happy that I went to try it out, but now that I've been there twice to get an idea of what it's about, I won't be returning. ", neutral

There are plenty of seats and the bathrooms are CLEAN!!!  The only complaint I have is that the seats aren't cushy like the OG Epoch, they're kinda hard. And it doesn't have nearly as much character as Epoch 1.

Epoch Coffee ," 12/4/2016 1 check-in Perfectly fine coffee shop. The coffee is good, but nothing outstanding. Their Drip of the Day was a bit too watery for me. Had to add a lot of sugar to it. Their mocha was very good though, nice and full-flavored.  The interior was pretty neat. Understated with plenty of seating. Perfect place to be on a chilly, rainy day. ", neutral 
Epoch Coffee ," 10/25/2016 1 check-in I'd be wanting to try this spot for a long time and when the opportunity finally presented itself, I eagerly jumped!  After circling the lot a few times for a parking spot, I contemplated if this was worth a to-go latte, but I was determined. The coffee shop is tucked away in The Village shopping center with the hellish aforementioned parking lot of customers of all the various business competing for a spot.  Already a little defeated by the time I entered Epoch, I was welcomed by a relaxing atmosphere with a ton of seating options. I immediately realized it was a coffee shop really designed for people looking to plug-in and get some serious work done. They even have a nice patio in the back to take your work outside. If I have a long work day in the future, I'll know to go here to get in the zone, however for a casual meet-up, this might not be your place.  While there's definitely not a sense of urgency with the wait staff, it was more the lack of customer service that left a little more to be desired for me. In addition, compared to the standard sizes seen elsewhere in coffee shops, the large was more like a small. ", neutral 
Epoch Coffee ," 11/20/2016 1 check-in Cute place. Try the Mojo iced coffee... bomb.com. Plenty of indoor space: tables, bar seating and sofas. There's a quaint little outdoor seating area out back-- a portion of the outdoor space is covered. As far as the service, eh... it's not the best; friendly, but a bit slow to acknowledge their customers, which was a bit awkward to experience and to watch. All in all, Epoch is a pretty good coffee spot. I'd return for the Mojo. Chai Chai and mojo ", pos 
Epoch Coffee ," 8/3/2016 I'm not sure what it is about this place, but I feel like every time I step foot in it I am being silently judged by the baristas, like they don't think I'm jiggy-enough-with-it to be in their presence. I also think it's strange they only have 2 or so latte flavors... the first time I visited I desperately scanned their tiny menu for even a hint of options, but alas, vanilla it was.  I can't quite explain it, just something about the vibe here makes me wanna whip my phone out and Google Map other coffee shops. ", neutral

Epoch Coffee ," 2/4/2016 8 check-ins Listed in Austin Espresso Essentials Epoch has a wonderful hipster vibe to it - great ambience and really chill, friendly workers. They also have a wide menu - pour over, drip, cold brew, and espresso coffee drinks as well as a number of teas. The staff is also very helpful, answering questions any customers may have, and are easy to converse with.  I ordered a simple latte, and sat at the bar, but there is a wide range of seating from couches to small tables. Their espresso has a wonderful bitter coffee taste - super satisfying. I will warn that if you prefer sweeter drinks, you may want to order something with an added flavor of some kind. I've also heard their french press is great, but haven't tried it yet.  It's the perfect spot to catch up with friends or work. I'll come here again if I'm ever in North Austin! Latte + Vanilla Latte ", pos 
Epoch Coffee ," 7/29/2016 3 check-ins This location is on par with it's OG location (North Loop) it terms of drinks and the atmosphere is pretty good. I really love that they serve hot tea pots here. But I have a few issues:  1. The food. They have a decent kitchen just sitting there. When they first opened they used to make snacks and this was awesome! Now, the food and selection is sub par and unappetizing -- everything is prepackaged and brought in. The OG location does this too but they have way better vendors.  2. The hours. They used to be open until midnight but now close at 10pm. I hate this especially since the other location is 24 hours. While I don't think this location should be open 24 hours, I'm not sure why they're closing so early when the place is still really busy at 10pm. Bring back later hours... 12pm Thursday, Friday, Sat? Makes sense being next to Alamo Draft House.  3. The music. It's way too loud most of the time. I just heard a lady say ""it's too loud in here I can't hear you let's go outside"". The baristas often have the music BLASTING to where you will have a hard time hearing the person in front of you. I can't think. Don't even try talking a call inside... They also play weird shit. Play something your general customer population will enjoy, I'm not into your 80s metal. *** As I am writing this! A second group of moved out side ""is it quite out there?"" *** ", neutral

Epoch Coffee ," 7/31/2016 The coffee at this place is tricky, because once you come here, you might compare the taste of coffee at other shops and it wont do it for you.  The first time you try their iced latte with a shot of vanilla and sweetened to perfection, you will never feel the same euphoric feeling again, and its kind of a bummer.    But its better to have had this just once in your life then never again.  Oh and every time I go there, the baristas are very nice.  You never get the coffee snob vibe, which personally turns me off to some coffee shops. ", pos 
Epoch Coffee ," 7/16/2016 This place has great coffee and pastries.  However, it's hit or miss with the baristas.  Some are lovely and friendly, others are typical hipster with an attitude.

I heard the modem times when trying to connect (older folks know what I'm talking about). Anyway, there's no problem with connectivity at Epoch. Plus, the bartenders are super friendly.

Epoch Coffee ," 9/1/2015 1 check-in I really liked the original Epoch location near airport blvd. I have good memories there, drinking coffee with my friends and eating good pasteries. I saw this new location when I was going to Madam mam's for lunch and instrantly I kenw that that is the place that I would like to go for a cup of coffee after the lunch.  I like this place, the atmosphere, and nice people working there. Everyhing should be above four strats. Except, the taste of coffee. I am not a coffee expert so my taste toward coffee may be very particular. I like dark french roast but when I tried the ""regular"" drip coffee. It was very sour. I know some coffee beans (or the type of roasting) have sour flavor but that's not the style of coffee that I prefer. So this review may be very skewed.

Epoch Coffee ," 3/21/2016 Another good coffee shop in Austin... I'm really amazed at how many places in this city are on point with their espresso. This location is tidy and comfortable. A good balance between shops that are so minimalistic you feel like you are in a museum art piece, and the places that feel like they haven't been cleaned in a dozen years. Like most places, I try an Americano the first time I stop in and unlike many places the Americano was perfect. I could imagine this place is slammed on the weekends given the location but I came in on a Monday afternoon. Plenty of seats taken by people with laptops and tablets, but still more than adequate seating.  Barista's seemed chill and friendly enough for me. ", pos

Epoch Coffee ," 6/15/2015 1 check-in I agree with the general star rating for this location... Call me picky! and I am when it comes to my coffee... :D especially if they set my expectations for good coffee, and especially if they have some good tools to make it... Also I expect that hip vibe from the place, stylish cups and warm welcome environment. Epoch disappointed on a few of those parameters... The space is large, but lacks style and atmosphere, feels like an old sandwich shop that was rented for, what I expected to be, a great coffee shop.  Now, my cappuccino... It's espresso and foam, people! A lot of foam (not macchiato) and not much milk (not a latte). It looked pretty, but was all milk inside... Sight... May be their sandwiches are great... And the Internet is pretty fast. So, may be I will be back, just make sure to have lower expectations... They still have better coffee than Starbucks, don't get me wrong :) ", neutral 
Epoch Coffee ," 7/6/2016 I ordered the vanilla almond milk latte and fell in love. It's everything a latte should be . Light fluffy and (for me) perfectly sweet. They make their own syrups in house. The vanilla doesn't overwhelm coffee instead complementing it with every sip. The environment is perfect if you want to come study in a cool , laid back atmosphere.

Epoch Coffee ," 7/20/2014 4 check-ins I have held off on reviewing this place as I am very torn between three or four stars.  I have landed on three as I have come here several times, and have always taken my coffee away, as I am never compelled to stay here.  The coffee and staff are great, but cleanliness and ambiance are lacking.  My favorite is the cold brew coffee (sourced from Texas coffee roasters).  Their espresso is also tasty (sourced by Cuvee).  By the afternoon the pastries are limited and look stale, there is a small kitchen that serves up East End pies, and some interesting sounding food bowls and sandwiches.  Not really any fast take away gluten free options. The comfortable couch section off to the side looks dank and dirty sometimes, and just a hint too dark.  The rest of the seating area is cleaner, and they do have a nice small outside patio when the weather is right.  What is up with the ladies bathroom?  The door is still missing, and the useable stall looks like it was cleaned several weeks ago.    I also like that this place is open till 12 am, which makes a quick take away coffee before heading to a late night Alamo movie convenient See all photos from Mindy H. for Epoch Coffee ", neutral 
Epoch Coffee ," 3/14/2015 1 check-in On convenience, really good wireless connectivity. friendliness ...they are really really good, but if rating them on coffee...it is definitely meh.  But then not everyone is obsessed about that kind of stuff like me.  And when I say coffee ...I don't mean a latte, but a pour over or do a espresso. They guys have a pretty expensive machine to pull espressos, let they are always a let down with a very thin watery to non-existent crema, pour overs are done so hurriedly that once does not really get the full extraction of flavor for what otherwise should be a great cup of coffee coming from Cuvee.  On the other side of coin is easy accessibility, really good connection speeds, reasonable service and fairly helpful staff then ends up with this place being A-OK. A fairly pedestrian espresso. ..no discernable crema ", neutral 
Epoch Coffee ," 5/7/2016 Since all of my other reviews on Yelp tend to be complaints (sorrynotsorry) I thought I'd give a shout out to one of my favorite spots to quaff caffeine and work. The staff is friendly, kind, and  quick, the atmosphere is chill and has the paradoxical feel of an industrial space that is also and inviting. The coffee is strong and ethically sound, they have a small but decent selection of GF snacks, and even though sometimes it gets so crowded I've walked in and turned right back around to leave, mostly there is room at the inn. Their pretty authentic, homemade chai is the perfect combination of flavorful and potent but not too sweet. If you're used to a super sugary chai you might look elsewhere. I only wish they stayed open later here, like their rougher-around-the-edges sibling on North Loop. ", pos 
Epoch Coffee ," 10/27/2015 I love this place. I've been going for around a year and a half now and it is my go-to spot. The atmosphere is awesome and great for getting work done. It's also very chill, so showing up in the evening to chat with friends or work on group projects is fun, but the best part about Epoch is the baristas. They make an effort to know your name and have conversations with you and all are very friendly and offer suggestions if you're looking for something new to drink. The music selection kind of goes everywhere, but I kind of like it. It's never the same thing. They even offer a place to display art and don't take a cut if you sell anything. The coffee is also very good after they changed to a new brand a few months ago.  I think the only reason I have to not give 5 stars is that the internet is finicky at best and doesn't work at all at worst. It seems to work best in the mornings when very few people are in, but you start jumping between their two routers around noon and into the evening. I wouldn't say much about it except it is kinda of a 'working' coffee-shop, and if I KNOW I need internet that day for a client, I have to pass and go somewhere I know I won't get dropped or work from home.  All that being said, this is still my #1 place to go in Austin. Great atmosphere, very relaxing and not too loud so I can concentrate on what I'm doing or hear a conversation I am having with a friend. Keep up the good work guys! ", pos 
Epoch Coffee ," 10/11/2015 I've been a regular at Epoch for a little over a year now. I keep coming back because the atmosphere is chill, the house-made chai is good, and the baristas are friendly and knowledgeable.  Yes, the music selection is quirky-sometimes they play a little too much Kate Bush or have an odd mix going on in the background-but it's rarely too distracting for getting work done.  They're working on being more personable by asking names and having more conversations with customers, and most of their baristas are coming from other coffee shops around town.  I haven't yet had a reason not to return. The plentiful parking and convenient north location are also big wins. ", pos 
Epoch Coffee , 1/15/2016 1 check-in Great place to come off of Anderson Lane. I live in the neighborhood so I come here all the time. Great place to drink coffee and hang out with friends. Small and intimate area but nice courtyard in the back to move around. , pos 
Epoch Coffee ," 3/20/2014 Updated review 6 check-ins This was my favorite new discovery, but sadly it did not last. Parking had always been awful, but there has not been any seating the last two times I've gone in and prices were just increased $0.50 for all drinks (except the cortado, I think). I know $0.50 isn't a lot, but the original prices were already higher than Starbucks and I don't feel like Epoch deserves any slack for mispricing when they have had another store open for years to experiment with. Also, my usual cappuccino had always been served in their bigger cups (about 12 oz) and they just recently downsized all drinks (except mochas, as far as I can tell) to their small cups (about 8 oz).  Updated prices, for reference:  Cappuccino: $3.25 to $3.75 (Starbucks Tall = $2.75) Latte: $3.50 to $4.00 (Starbucks Tall = $2.75) Mocha: $3.75 to $4.25 (Starbucks Tall = $3.25) Drip: $2.00 to $2.50 (Starbucks Tall = $1.65)  If you're rich and willing to pay a buck more for less coffee, of course Epoch tastes better. But if you're a poor student like me, back across the street to Starbucks it is... New menu as of 05/06/14, but careful because it'll probably be completely different tomorrow ", neutral

Epoch Coffee ," 10/15/2015 BIG THANKS to Britt @ Epoch Coffee for introducing San Francisco's most delicious coffee roaster, Ritual Coffee Roasters, to The Great State of Texas!!  This coffee is so delish it doesn't need cream and it sure as heck doesn't need sugar. It's delicious all until itself and Britt made sure Epoch Coffee serves it daily. They also sell it by the package to enjoy at home.  Ritual was started in the heart of the Mission district in San Francisco by Eileen Hassi in 2005. I remember when I worked at Flora Grubb Gardens Eileen teaching me about coffee flavors and roasting while she hand stamped her paper cups with a rubber stamp.

Epoch Coffee ," 12/18/2013 118 check-ins Listed in ""Nuptial Coffee Bliss!"", Anderson Lane is the new Black This new Anderson Epoch bears the same resemblance with its North Loop sibling as I have with my own sister - absolutely none. I should probably disclose I don't actually have a sister.  And since we're in disclosing mode, let me mention my coffee consumption has gone from two quarts a day to less than two cups, because it's my worst trigger for smoking ever. The point being nothing pisses me off quicker these days than tepid swill posing as coffee. That puts me in a really really, dark place.     I'm happy to report this new Epoch is all sunshine and rainbows. Their $2 house pour using my cup was wonderful. They have Russell's pastries, a real kitchen from 10am-2pm, and WiFi blazing at 10m-down. A laid-back & friendly staff who appear to enjoy working there. And granted this place is brand-spanking new, but it's so clean and sterile here that you can literally do coffee bean surgery right off the floor. If you want to feel personality, head over to the North Loop Epoch, you'll have to give this Anderson Epoch a little more time to develop.    The bottom line is let's see how they fare, with Starbie's around the corner and Genuine Joe's up the street. Maybe they're shooting for the post-Alamo crowd, or the Anderson Lane lunch-hoppers. Maybe if you build it, they will come. I do know this new Epoch has good coffee and it's a pleasant respite. In this particular hip & cool gentrified section of town, it's almost quietly epic. No particular reason why I like this pic, I just do. Okay, I like playing with contrasts & angles. They make a pretty cortado here for $3. Awww, coffee art.

Epoch Coffee ," 1/24/2016 This is one of the better executed coffee shops that we have visited in Austin. There is plenty of seating, different types of seating, spread out, outdoor even. The music is loud enough to blend the noises but not enough to take over your brain. We can't speak to the coffee. For us, coffee is either drinkable or not: it was fine. We didn't try the wifi which is normally important to us but other reviewers said it is fine. The only suggestion is to integrate some textile into the decor to absorb some of the background noise given all of the hard surfaces. ", pos

Freakin baby cup gave me the shakes at 11:30pm and now I can't wait to go back. It also didn't help that I chased that down with their tea. Ben was such a sweetheart and told us he would do a second steeping on our tea. I loved everything about this place and can't wait to visit again.

Answered all our questions and treated each customer before us, to include us, like we were friends.  Small conversation and just being genuinely nice.    Cappuccino was apparently the best one my g/f had ever experienced.  I had a blood orange tea that was unique and delicious.  I really like that they fill their own tea bags.  The set up is made for studying, so if you want to have a conversation, it's a bit awkward, but not that bad.  They have some table games and couch/lounge areas to be a bit more secluded and play games. ", pos 
Epoch Coffee ," 7/9/2014 Updated review I like Epoch coffee still. Clean lines, fast wifi, great A/C, new outside seating. I haven't resampled food and I'm not going to buy those pastries sitting there since 8am.  Here's the gig though. It's been 7 months and that bathroom is still a broken down mess. The door to the second stall is still off. The towel dispenser is hanging open like a gaping maw with sodden roll of towel on top. The one bathroom that does function has grimy floors and the TP is off the roll sitting on the handicap bar.  There are 30 people in here and one lonely barista trying to do it all which makes wait times long and her life miserable (I'm sure.) I expect some of these things at the old location which is arguably less put together but I thought they'd fix some of these things in the half year they've been open. ", neutral

Then you have to fend for yourself. I didn't want to go to Starbucks either. It's a nice area with old school furniture and there are board games.  Their coffee hits the spot.

I have to say their iced coffee is good, albeit a little on the acidic side (which is somewhat typical in cold brews anyway).   They make amaaaaazing espresso -- very smooth and drinkable.  People who work here seem decent and knowledgable.  I haven't ever had an issue I needed resolved, so I'm not entirely sure how they handle that sort of thing.  Prices are a couple quarters more than I would expect on most drinks.  Nice chill vibe in the shop, and lots of seating.  Girl's bathroom is really spacious and clean.

There's lots of comfortable seating: several couches, lots of tables for working, and a patio out back.

Epoch Coffee ," 5/10/2015 The drinks here are pretty top notch, especially if you consider your options in the area. Usually they only have one person working up front, which for me is fine, never the impatient one.  Russell's pastry's are offered from the front counter which I've never been a fan of, but this review is based solely on the coffee & the service I've received. Not sure why people are annoyed that they sit out all day. I've worked at many places that sell pastries (including whole foods) if you think they are being rotated out in an hourly basis, you're not very food smart..  I usually order a cortado & it never really disappoints. Texas coffee traders is served for ice coffee instead of the cuvée that is used for espresso. I love TCT & wish they would be able to shine a bit more in Austin. The tea selection here is pretty good, I get the white blueberry iced sometimes, haven't been to very many places that offer fancy teas, cooled.  The only thing that bugs me is the barista will often ignore me when I'm next in line & loudly chat to a friend that has walked in behind me. Usually the friends order is taken first & then I'm left with a smug, ""what can I get you?"" I know this isn't the owner, who is kinda quiet, which doesn't bother me. Just something that irks me.. I'm a regular, but not a stay too long chatty kind of person. This of course doesn't deter me from coming back, just an excuse for a soul eye roll.  All in all I really like the vibe of this place, it's always really clean, the music is perfect in the AM, the coffee is delicious & they have a good patio in the back. ", pos

Epoch Coffee ," 2/19/2014 3 check-ins Listed in 2014 Yelp 100 Challenge, West Anderson? Best Anderson., The best part of waking up is Cuvée in your cup! Let me tell you a thing - this place is just the cutest. Everybody already knows that I have a favorite coffee shop in Austin, but I decided that I could have a south Austin favorite and a north Austin favorite, but the south Austin favorite is still number one. Wait, maybe they can be tied for first because I don't want either of them to feel second best.  It doesn't matter what time of day I come here - the staff members are just straight up adorable. They ask you about your day and they care about your answer; heck, they'll even have a full on conversation with you! The standard, ""Hi, how are you?"" is not just an automated response here; it's a genuine question backed by real curiosity. Call me a sucker for human warmth, but, well... okay, I'm just a sucker for that kind of thing. (When I worked in retail, I tried to do the exact same thing because seeing someone's face light up when they see that you are actually engaging them as a person instead of treating them as yet another customer is positively wonderful. It's the little things that matter most, you know?)  They serve Cuvée coffee here, which is my favorite type of coffee and pretty much the only coffee I will drink. I went from never drinking coffee to only drinking one specific brand of coffee. My brain is so silly sometimes. The one time I ordered a hot chocolate, I asked if they could sprinkle cinnamon on the top because that is my favorite way to drink hot chocolate, and they informed me that they use a Mexican chocolate that already has cinnamon in it. They did not lie and that hot chocolate just might be my favorite hot chocolate in Austin.  Then there's the story of how I went on one of the cutest first dates ever - I suggested Epoch because it was centrally located to my office and his apartment. As we were ordering, I mentioned that this was our first date and the barista said, ""No way. You're kidding, right?"" I laughed and told him, no, I was not kidding. ""I never would have guessed. It seems like you two have known each other for forever."" I took this as a good sign since I had literally met this guy not one minute before that exchange.  The date went very well and we stayed there chatting for some time. At some point, maybe two hours in, the same barista walks to our table with a slice of cheesecake and says, ""Because it seems like your first date is going well."" My heart melted right then and there. How thoughtful is that? He brought us a slice of cheesecake because our date was going well. I just can't get over how sweet that gesture was.  I just can't even with how cute this place is and how warm and fuzzy it makes me feel inside. Everyone here is so thoughtful and kind and genuine and there's something about that that I just love. I live for those connections, however small, because it's those connections that keep us all going at the end of the day, and any place that makes my inner social worker sing has found a forever fan in me.

I still don't know what it is, so don't ask me.  This is another version of the ever so popular, open 24 hour coffee shop on North Loop. This one is not open 24/7, they have human hours.  I like this new location. Its in the Village Shopping Center (near the Alamo DH). The inside needs help. It doesn't feel like a coffee shop. It needs some pizzazz! Something to set it apart. But there is plenty of seating which the other location will never have due to its proximity to campus. They also have a small kitchen, therefore a lot more options for food here. An outside patio is available for smokers and nice weather observers.  On a strange and sadder note: To add to Kelly S's review, the women's restroom is the saddest restroom I've ever seen. There is one stall, and the 2nd one has no door on it. The bathroom reminds me of a bare, sad hospital bathroom. They don't even have good hand soap. They've got that 99cent shit from HEB in there.

The drip coffee is cheap, and refills are only $1. The mocha here is still good, but you can only go Mexican mocha. The beloved mojo is still here as well. They've got solid food menu (from what it seems), but  it's only available until 3pm.  Big space. Most tables are only for two people, so it's not great for big groups.

I love a reasonably quiet place to work and chat. This Epoch new location hits all of those on the nose.  My soy latte was so delicious- really really good espresso, creamy milk- that I didnt even need sugar ( and that's saying a lot for me.)  The only downside. It's already way too popular. The line to get coffee stretched around the bar and halfway to the door. We waited about 45 mins before daring to get in line. Also ( and I am sure its because they are new) they were out of almost everything- mocha syrup, decaf beans ( mine was the last.) Being popular can have its downsides sometimes, but I am sure that it will work out the kinks for the future. ", pos

Epoch Coffee ," 12/20/2013 21 check-ins ROTD 4/28/2014 This review isn't really fair.   I feel like Epoch Coffee moved into this W. Anderson location because I WILLED it to happen.  The cosmos knew I wanted an excellent cafe in the empty space next to our office, and they made it happen.    I couldn't be happier.  First, I appreciate the design/layout.  They leased a long, narrow, weird-shaped, old space and made it BEAUTIFUL.   This is not an easy feat.  I know, I tried to do the same with our office location.  You can tell that the design was very well thought out.  Lots of warm woods, excellent lighting, art on the walls, and seating that satisfies the hard-working lone-wolf and the socialite.    I really love the ordering area.  The minimal aesthetic brings the focus to what they do best: coffee.   They have pour-overs, several selections of beans and grinds, and (the pièce de résistance) the incredible Strada espresso machine.   If you are a coffee connoisseur, you won't be disappointed.    As for the food, I am thrilled.  I like to eat healthy.  Our office is surrounded by some of the best food in Austin (Bartletts, Phonatic, Hopdoddy, Verts etc) but we don't have a lot of healthy alternatives.  Last time I ate at Epoch, I had an incredible Vegan Club sandwich.  It is very cool that a place that specializes in coffee can make food this good.  Most importantly, the people there are awesome.  Everyone on our team loves going to Epoch and talking to their team.   They like great music, they know coffee, and they are extremely friendly.   I am big fan, and I will be in Epoch often.

Epoch Coffee ," 3/17/2014 I live right by the original Epoch on North Loop. It's typically packed - as is Monkey Nest - so it's good to see another coffee shop open up in the area. I hope that this will provide some much needed relief.  It's a fairly small place, but the space is well utilized. Couches at the front provide lots of seating for socialization. Along the side wall is a row of two-seater tables good for those on a date or (as most people were) working on laptops. There are about three 4-seater tables in the back. It also seemed that they had a back patio.  Small selection of pastries from Russell's bakery. They also have a kitchen that makes sandwiches and salads from 10-2.  Service was good, coffee is what you expect. Overall, I'm very happy this place opened up here. ", pos

Epoch Coffee ," 1/16/2014 1 check-in I did a happy dance when the permit went up for Epoch many months ago because we could really use a non-chain coffee purveyor with good hangout space on Anderson Lane. (Yes, I know Genuine Joe's is just down the road, but it has heating/cooling issues and you roll the dice on surly service each and every time.)  I finally paid Epoch a visit and am pleased. It's the brighter, cleaner cousin to the original outpost on North Loop. You'll still have a smattering of hipsters and quite a few gamers, but they peaceably coexist alongside solo students with their noses in books and chatty friends catching up on their week. There are tables, benches, sofas, comfy chairs, plentiful outlets...something for everyone.  Unlike a previous reviewer who found the service abrasive, I was struck by how friendly the barista and the fellow who gave me the wi-fi password were. I enjoyed my piping hot, cinnamon-y mocha so much that I also sipped away on my husband's when he declared his too strong. The only hiccup was the temperature of the building. Um, was that my breath I just saw? It was really freakin' cold. (And that says a lot, coming from someone who typically runs hot). Oh, and as others have mentioned, it's not a great spot for a snack unless you happen to roll in between 10am and 2pm. Huh? I hope they expand their food hours over time.  Despite my quibbles, I'm so glad to have Epoch (aka Circa 13) in the 'hood. ", pos 
Epoch Coffee ," 2/21/2015 11 check-ins My go-to spot for a latte. They really know what they're doing (coffee-wise.) Lattes usually include a beautiful latte-art design for your (brief) viewing pleasure before you happily drink it down. When the weather is warm, get an iced mojo. Creamy and sweet iced coffee that's gotten me through quite a few study sessions. If super sweet is not your thing, order a half iced mojo. Food- they usually have a fairly good selection of pastries, although they're in this weird, very low-to-the-ground glass case that's built into the counter (can anyone explain to me what's up with that? You're selling scones, not diamond earrings) I digress.. If you need something more substantial to snack on, they sell pizza by the slice from Eastside Pies (try the circa! Feta. Broccoli. Sweet potato. Strange yet oh-so delicious.)  My ONLY reason for not giving these guys five stars is the customer service. It's like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get. ", pos

The Factory - Cafe With a Soul ," 11/30/2016 1 check-in Listed in Brunch Spots I loved the eclectic and homey plush decor and who doesn't want to swing and drink their coffee?  I would categorize this as a pricier coffee place but, to me it was worth it.  After Thanksgiving nobody wants to make brunch so we headed out in search of chicken and waffles.  There is ample parking in the private lot and  ordering is done through I-Pads.  Pick a seat and they will call your name when your items are ready.  Be patient because some of the coffee drinks take longer than others.  I had the cold brew coffee, chicken and waffles and we shared a pop+art!  The po+art was strawberry; light and fluffy on the outside and gooey sweet filling on the inside.  The chicken and waffles wasn't the standard so expect different, complex and interesting flavors from the accompanying slaw and sauce.  I thoroughly enjoyed it but, the waffle was a bit bland and maybe could have used a bit of honey to spruce it up.  The coffee here is spot on and I hear that their hot chocolate is the bomb but, I will have to wait for the weather to cool off to try that.  A great place to be cozy and chat with your friends, a date or read a book. Chicken and waffles Pop tart Coffee See all photos from Carmela S. for The Factory - Cafe With a Soul ", pos

The Factory - Cafe With a Soul ," 11/20/2016 1 check-in Very cute cafe! I think from the moment I stepped in, there really wasn't anything I didn't find cute at The Factory. From their decor to their cups, everything was really cute. It's really the perfect place for a catching up with friends or a coffee date.  When you go order, there's really the least amount of interaction ever with the workers. You just pick your order on an iPad and they'll call your order out after for you to pick up at the counter. The whole thing's pretty novel honestly. I got the Viva Matcha Latte and it was so good! Perfect amount of sweetness and perfect temperature. I went on a cold night and this cafe is just so cozy, it was such a great combination. They have these swings as well which were pretty fun to sit on honestly.  Prices are what I would expect for a cafe like this, not super cheap, but not too pricey. There's no wifi here, so if you want to study, maybe this isn't the right place.

The Factory - Cafe With a Soul ," 10/27/2016 2 check-ins Listed in ""Nuptial Coffee Bliss!"", Anderson Lane is the new Black Oh hey, the pro vs con format. I've never used that before. Let's try it:  Pros: 1. This place is cooler than I thought. 2. It's open until 2am. No, really. 3. They have beer & wine. I didn't know that until I saw the beer taps. They offered me a sample.  Cons: 1. If you have to describe The Factory with one word, it probably won't be ""inexpensive.""  I don't think they're shooting for the ""Sixth Coffeehouse on Anderson Lane but with Flash"" title here, I think they really want to be the official bistro in the neighborhood - far more casual than Bartlett or Hopdoddy, but with a lot more flair than Tea Haus or Starbuck Evenings. Staying open until 2am is a good start, and let's see if they add more to the menu. Remember, no one thought that gentrified Walmart would do well either.  In the meantime, have fun with those chicken & waffles, and their colorful matcha-infused coffees. I'm only interested in straight black, and their pourover Stumptown is great stuff. Try the $5 pop tart at least once, mainly because you can. And then let's meet back here in a couple of weeks, just to see what's been tweaked. This place defines hipster man-cave. I liked the long table with 1/2 bar chairs & stools, & the cool plates & cups. There's a $5 pop tart. ", pos

I finally found a coffee shop I can study at without sacrificing comfort (Starbucks' uncomfortable chairs). The coffee shop endorses social connection, hence, wifi  isn't available. It makes me really happy that a lot of students hang out here with their book bags and laptops and we can all just study in peace and somehow quiet (the background music can get pretty loud). Unfortunately, there will always be that kid who's obnoxiously loud and would like the whole world to know her business. Seriously, unless it's something intriguing or educational, no one cares. In addition, as much ""fun"" as this place looks, it's not child friendly. So parents, make sure your children do not hit the table in front of it and knock out the chess set. Lastly, the sex images in the bathrooms are definitely not appropriate for children.  The ambiance is very much like Austin-- very eccentric and hip! Food and drink presentations are on par. Drink prices are reasonable and similar to good ole Starbucks. But unlike you're typical coffee shop, they have real food such as chicken and waffles.  My favorite about this place is the cleanliness. The employees do a good job maintaining the place. Also, as I watch them make coffees, they do it with fines as if they're creating some type of art, it's pretty cool (in my opinion).  In conclusion, Cafe w/ a Soul is probably the best coffee shop I've ever been to. It's like studying in my own home but away from distractions. I'm awake!

The Factory - Cafe With a Soul ," 10/25/2016 1 check-in Ok, let's try this approach...  Pros: Music Seating Decor General ambiance Service  Cons: iPad ordering (I'm a crotchety old man, kids) Limited coffee menu, or menu in general Relatively expensive Food is pretty but lackluster  I'm still sitting here as I type this and I'm less than overjoyed with the experience, sadly. The space and vibe are great but not quite familiar or intimate enough to beat out a place like Genuine Joe down the street. It seems like they bank on the vibe, and fall short the rest of the way. (This would be a great hangout for the artsy/design crowd having a collaborative meeting.)  The staff is great but the iPad ordering system limits your required interaction with them. They take pride in no wifi to increase interaction but then use iPads instead of people?  Seating is ample, if cramped in a surprisingly large space.  But the food, kids. So pretty, but again lackluster. I tried the Pop+art ($5) and the Nutella Waffle ($4.75) and they both sit on their respective tiny awkward plates half eaten. (Yes the plate liners are cute) The waffle is a great idea but the waffle itself  has no flavor and there's no delight. The tart is similar - the pastry crust is much too thick compared to the Smuckers jam tasting filling and it is essentially just pure sugar. The pastry itself doesn't even taste buttery or crisp. Meh. There appears to be no soul in this confectionary.  Coffee- passable. But at $4 for a cortado and a $1.50 up-charge for almond milk- I'll pick another place.  I get why the reviews are so good here, but there are much better places nearby for that ""cafe with a soul"" feel. This feels like an ACL pop-up. Going for that?  Great, come here.

The Factory - Cafe With a Soul ," 11/17/2016 1 check-in Listed in 2016 - The Third Time is a Charm! The Factory has A+ decor and a very innovative interactionless (tablet) ordering system. This allows you to look up what to get without feeling pressured by a barista staring at you waiting for you to order. The eclectic selection of tables, couches, and swings (?!) inside with a small kiddy corner appeal to many different types of tastes. This is seriously a cool place to hang out.  However, when it comes to the coffee and food, it's rather not cheap. The waffles range from $4-$8, and coffee is between $3.50 and $5. The quality of the coffee is not yet up to par with other coffee mainstays in Austin, so I would probably not choose to come here just for coffee.

I didn't want to tell anyone how awesome The Factory - Cafe With a Soul is because I don't want it overrun and super busy with no place to sit like so many other decent coffee shops in Austin. I happened to come in here with a friend mid-week and we sat here for several hours, enjoying the peace and quiet, the atmosphere, and the awesome coffee.  This place is a little eclectic - lots of peculiar art, books, games, knick-knacks, and an almost head-scratching drink and food menu. Waffles and pop tarts...and beer? And... coffee mojitos? Well, it works. Whatever is going on here, it works fabulously. They serve Stumptown Coffee, which as someone from the Northwest, I totally appreciate. They also brew coffee correctly. There is not a hint of bitterness or overcooked milk going on here. The iPad ordering screens are mostly cool, (although they need more options for customization) and the million different types of seating, (couches, pillows, swings, big chairs, little chairs, bar seating, regular tables) is both delightful and refreshing. The baristas make foam art - something that I have only seen at Houndstooth here in Austin.

The Factory - Cafe With a Soul ," 10/12/2016 1 check-in Checked out The Factory this past Sunday with my husband. We wanted to try their delicious looking waffles and were definitely not disappointed.  Husband ordered an iced coffee drink that was delicious, but it wasn't as good as my Golden Age of Milk Tea, well worth the 10 minute wait for the tea to steep.  We both ordered the Nutella Waffle and it was perfect. From the wood plate with the AMAZING paper liner printed with a famous person and an inspirational quote from them. I wanted just the paper because it was so cute and well done. The waffle is basically half a waffle, spread with Nutella and a layer of bananas, then folded in half. While small, it was a perfect amount, the bananas balancing out the sweetness of the Nutella. The waffle itself was crisp perfection, providing a crunch to the meal. The menu is very limited: there was the nutella waffle and a fried chicken waffle. I'm hoping they'll eventually serve other waffles, but totally respect their decision to start small.  The space is gorgeous. From the swings to the mural above the bar, everything looks meticulously planned out. And here is where my biggest advice comes: this place is really not for kids. The way the seating is set up is really for larger people and there is definitely no place for high chairs. While there is giant magnetic poetry on one of the columns, a crazy chair outside and a couple of table games, the giant chess set looks risky for grabby kids. If you have a well-behaved child who can handle it, I would think its fine. However, I watched several families come in and either leave or order to go, commenting it wasn't the best space for them. While this doesn't bother me (I love kidless spaces), it might be jarring to someone expecting to have brunch with the family.  I am so excited to become a regular here! Great new spot! ", pos

It's super cute and trendy, to the point where it feels kind of out of place in a strip mall. Although I loved the interior design and general ambiance of the place, I was a little disappointed with the menu. This is more of a coffee shop than a cafe - their food options are pretty limited. My friend ordered the chicken and waffles and I ordered Nutella waffles with strawberries and bananas. For the price I paid, the portions were definitely on the smaller side.

The Factory - Cafe With a Soul ," 11/2/2016 I was so pleasantly surprised by this place! I only went because I had time to kill and they were the only coffee shop nearby open until 2 am. But I'm so glad I tried it out. It's not your typical Austin coffee shop. The quality of the drinks here was top notch, and they offer unique food and drinks. I had the macha latte (I think that's what it was called) and it was fantastic! The people were so friendly, the decor was beautiful, with plenty of comfortable seating (including swings from the ceiling!), and it was just the perfect place to chill with friends. I'll definitely be coming back! ", pos

Houndstooth Coffee ," 10/18/2016 1 check-in Cool, smooth, hipster coffee in Austin.  As customary to any vacation we go on, I try to find a hipster coffee place to go to- mostly because, well, I like my coffee (I think someday, it may give me an ulcer, but until then, I'll continue to drink it.)  After spending a few hours in the Texan sun (which definitely drained me), a nice cup of refreshing coffee sounded good.  We stopped by Houndstooth- a modern hipster place. I got the Japanese style iced coffee- I've had it before, and was pleased that it was offered here.  It was smooth and refreshing- and to my standards, I did not have to add milk/cream of any sort, - meaning the aftertaste was light and worth drinking black.  I'm sure they have even better hot coffees, but it was still a great stop while being in Austin. ", pos 
Houndstooth Coffee ," 10/17/2016 1 check-in I absolutely LOVE coffee and I love real coffee. None of that artificial pumpkin spice frap for me. If you enjoy really good coffee and drink lattes or cold brew, then this is the place for you. I ordered a latte and my boyfriend got an iced caffe Americano. Both were amazing!  If you're looking for the location, it is attached to the Frost Bank in Downtown Austin, but there is plenty of room inside to grab a seat, sip on coffee, and browse your computer. The cashier was super friendly and they did have a nice, clean bathroom inside that required a key. Iced latte & Iced caffe Americano. ", pos 
Houndstooth Coffee ," 10/14/2016 Houndstooth serves not only amazing coffee, but some tasty breakfast burritos from Tacodeli too. The coffee here is awesome. The Japanese style iced where they brew a single cup over ice may be a bit pricey, but the flavor is just so good. The staff is great as well and super friendly and knows their way around a tasty cup of coffee. The space is pretty open and has good light, so it's a perfect place for doing some work with your coffee. ", pos

The cafe has plenty of room and seating, great vibe and friendly baristas. A cool setting outside the houndstooth to sit and enjoy your coffee.  They have a pretty interesting variety of coffee. We had Cortado and brewed Coffee. Our drinks were well balanced, smooth and delicious . It is  definitely the place for you if you're a coffee snob!  Some of the speciality drinks are pricier.

Houndstooth Coffee ," 9/29/2016 Love their highly curated tea selection. The hibiscus rooibos is a favorite. Bright, tart, and a little funky.  Also, the baristas are very knowledge and quite friendly.  An extra plus for good wifi, and a very slight minus for a small pastry selection. ", pos 
Houndstooth Coffee ," 11/15/2016 It's everything you want in a serious coffee bar. They weigh their shots, they use great quality beans and they've got a selection of pastries or tacos. If you want a real espresso/coffee experience, look no further. ", pos 
Houndstooth Coffee ," 8/15/2016 As avid coffee drinkers we always appreciate milk steamed to perfection and some smooth, potent espresso. We visited Houndstooth coffee twice on our trip to Austin, and I am very glad we did. We were offered the choice between two different espresso beans when we ordered, and the baristas were always spot on when interpreting and explaining the flavors. We also got the blueberry muffin and the blueberry scone, and they were good! Would highly recommend this coffee place. ", pos

Houndstooth Coffee , 9/25/2016 Great coffee - had a couple of well needed quality Macchiatos after several bad brews elsewhere.  Wifi was a little sketchy today but they more than made up for it with a cracking 80/90s playlist that oozed good vibes all afternoon. , pos 
Houndstooth Coffee ," 9/6/2015 1 check-in I really want to have liked this place but the coffee just didn't fit my taste.  It's a beautiful and unique cafe nestled under a bank and office building. You can tell that they take their coffee making seriously because I have never seen anyone weight out the exact amount of coffee, time the exact amount of time the coffee should brew, and then serve it to you. Everything was done with so much detail and precision that I thought I would get the best tasting coffee in the world. What I got was definitely rich but it was also really weird. I ordered the Japanese iced coffee and it was like a mix of green tea with coffee. The taste is definitely deep and multi-dimensional but there was a weird after taste. I wish they would develop this into some type of iced latte that is sweeter because I think it was taste a lot better. This is definitely a place for those who appreciate their black and dark, rich coffee. I guess for me, it just didn't hit the spot. Japanese ice coffee ", neutral

We found Houndstooth and well, fate had our cards played right as our Barista's name was... Austin!!! C'mon now, that's pretty amazing! As Austin noticed Roland L's GGET cap, he nervously extracted our espressos expertly. Our Java was quite amazing, smooth and delicious. Why only 4 stars, well, our second trip by a different barista scored a lot lower, more like a 3.5.

Houndstooth Coffee , 1/20/2016 1 check-in This is a nice spot right in downtown Austin.  We were looking for a place to grab a quick cup and relax a bit while we planned out our day.  This hit the spot.  I grabbed a nicely executed pour-over and spent a few minutes chatting with the barista.  He was incredibly friendly and well informed.  I always enjoy talking coffee with other coffee geeks.  I feel like I always learn something.  Prices were right in line with what you'd expect for high end coffee and I would certainly stop back here the next time I am in town. , pos 
Houndstooth Coffee , 7/17/2016 3 check-ins Round 1: The cold brew doesn't really compare in strength or flavor to the one at Ruckus but it was okay.  Round 2: The almond milk latte (while overpriced for 12oz) is superior. , pos 
Houndstooth Coffee ," 11/8/2015 1 check-in Listed in Keep Austin Delicious Houndstooth is a bit hard to find due to the address, but once you get there, it's worth it for the well-made coffee as well as to see hipster Austin in action. The entrance is actually on the corner of 4th and Congress. Once you walk in, you see a bunch of artist types on laptops, a large and clean interior, and indie music playing on a countertop speaker. They have all sorts of coffee options as well as breakfast food items. They even do Japanese cold brew, though I went with the regular. They also have a bunch of tea options, if you're into that.

Houndstooth Coffee ," 1/11/2016 The baristas here are super knowledgeable about coffee.  If I had time to drink-in I would have tried the interesting sounding ginger espresso drink of the day with decaf espresso, but that was a drink-in exclusive and I needed to go to a meeting.  I also asked about their teas but they're mostly high caffeine.  So I went with a decaf latte.  I can respect that some coffee houses want to have only natural sweeteners.  All that they had out was raw sugar.  But, I really need to avoid adding sugar for health reasons, so I would have preferred to have my sweeteners of choice available (Splenda or Stevia).  Since I had no choice I used the sugar and it took a whole lot of raw sugar to sweeten the latte to even a fraction of the sweetness I usually enjoy.  I try not to think of how much sugar that was.  But, it tasted good.  If I lived nearby and could keep a box of splenda on my desk, I'd be happy to get coffee from here again and sweeten it myself.  Unfortunately since I'm only here on business, I'm better off sticking to the generally inferior Starbucks so I can have coffee w/o tons of sugar and have it be at the sweetness that I like. ", pos

My friend's coffee was delightful and I was able to watch my bicycle from the window. (I forgot the key to my bike lock, so that was imperative).

Houndstooth Coffee ," 1/21/2016 1 check-in Very friendly baristas. I had the cold brew, and it was a little weaker than my usual taste, but still greater. The self service station for sugar or milk was very small and only served 1 person at a time. There was not even room to put my coffee down. The station also only has raw sugar, which is great to add to coffee, but does not dissolve at all for colder mixes. Nevertheless, the baristas were very great and refilled the half and half container as soon as they spotted me. She even went looking for me after she refilled it since I returned to my table. I was lucky enough to come before the rush, but the line can be 10-15 people long as quite the wait it seems.

Houndstooth Coffee ," 2/10/2016 I really like their coffee, so 4 stars there. Delicious. No question at all.  Baristas are nice if you know them. I don't and they are still polite, so we are good there too! In fact we are moving along just fine...  But then, I have a conundrum. Let me set the mood: 9am on a weekday, very few people in line (2 ahead of me, to be exact). The two in front are extremely curious about the menu, the different flavors and options. There is a barista listening to the two chat about the coffee options for the day, and another barista at the register. Today I just wanted tacos. Just a couple of tacos, and I will be on my way. Nothing more. Please PLEASE don't make me wait out these two coffee-curious patrons ahead of me. Please...? So I wander over to the barista at the register thinking I could sneak in a taco-only order. Barista #1 wouldn't allow it. ""Back in line, sir."" Even if the two people in front of you haven't even decided what to get yet, you need to wait. Please, just wait. So I waited. But do I really need to wait? Can we rethink this? Bend the rules a little? Have some compassion and creative thinking beyond the prescribed establishment rules? Maybe...create a taco-only line!? (Go to Black Star Co-op and see how they do it. Brilliant.) At any rate, no notch on the stars for that. It is what it is. Just think there could be improvements there.  It's very expensive. Really good, just very expensive. And no taco line. UGH! I said it again. Sorry. Maybe I am dinging them for that. I am a jerk. And a line cutter. ", neutral

Houndstooth Coffee ," 1/31/2015 I found this place pretty late in my week-long trip to Austin, and I ended up visiting several times. I tried the iced coffee, espresso, and pour-over, and all three were the best I had in Austin.  I'm not sure what brewing method they used for the iced coffee, but it tasted like cold brew -- low in acidity. I liked it significantly better than the one I had at Dominican Joe (which is also a competent coffee shop).  The espresso shot was sweet, and a little tart without getting into the silly levels of sourness that so many 'cool' coffee shops seem so fond of.  The pour-over was a delicious Burundi, roasted by North Carolina's Counter Culture Coffee, and brewed on a Kalita Wave. (The Aeropress madness seems to have mostly bypassed Austin.) This was my favorite of the three drinks.  I did not try the milk drinks, but I did see them make a latte, and the milk appeared to be correctly steamed and poured.  Houndstooth is a multi-roaster cafe; in addition to Counter Culture, I saw beans from PT's Coffee (Kansas), and some Texan roaster whose name escapes me.  In addition to coffee, they have Taco Deli breakfast tacos, the usual coffee shop pastries, and I think I saw loose leaf teas. Prices were maybe a shade higher than similar shops in Seattle, with the espresso shot running closer to $3 than $2.  Note: this place is nearly invisible if you're walking down Congress, unless you're specifically looking for it (which you should be). It's in the southwest corner of the Frost Tower, with the main entrance on Congress, and a side door on 4th. ", pos 
Houndstooth Coffee ," 3/16/2015 First time in this coffee place while visiting Austin during SxSW. I ordered an iced coffee, which was a cold brew. The coffee was not too strong with still a slight hint of acidity. Since it was cold brew coffee, it tasted very different from iced coffee prepared in the traditional way with hot water. Give it a try if you want a different experience from regular ice coffee. You may like it.  The barista at the counter was extremely nice and patient when I asked about how the coffee was prepared, etc.  The atmosphere is quite pleasant and relaxing. The place looks spacious with large windows facing the street. You can get a pretty good outside view from the inside. There is also an outside sitting area where you can buy drinks directly. It is a good place to take a break after a nice walk in downtown Austin. ", pos 
Houndstooth Coffee ," 1/24/2016 We had a great breakfast here of lattes and breakfast tacos (a la carte from Tacodeli).

Houndstooth Coffee , 4/5/2016 1 check-in So I just started working around the corner from this place and this is my first stop in. When I walked in the place was completely dead two customers at tables. Then I realized that I was walking in to the shop two minutes before they closed. To most establishments this would be an absolute nightmare of a situation. The barista greeted me warmly and very excepting and was more than happy to dirty some of the equipment that was already clean for a customer who was still coming in during business hours.

Houndstooth Coffee ," 12/27/2015 It was ok. Taste was different and a little nutty for my flavor. The atmosphere was a little stale and needs to be broken in a bit. But overall it was pretty good. Better than average, but not 4.5-5 star place just yet. In due time. Definitely better local places to go to. ", neutral 
Houndstooth Coffee ," 4/10/2016 Not as much of a fan as the one on North Lamar. The espresso incredibly acidic, following the unfortunate trend that has arisen third wave coffee shops of late. The Congress location lacks a lot of the soul and character the other location had. ", neutral 
Houndstooth Coffee ," 9/21/2013 3 check-ins Easy to find once you know it's there, tucked back along the side to the entrance of Frost Bank.  Was excited to see Houndstooth has another location.  I suppose I am a bit of a coffee geek, and Houndstooth knows what they are doing.  They have an extensive training they put their baristas through, and they are very well versed in the beans they have on ""tap"".  True baristas are artists, they really can make a great coffee taste bad if they aren't familiar with the bean and conditions.  I was lucky to be able to join the Coffee Geekery event via Yelp that occurred here.  It was my first coffee cupping in the US.  Great way to try a variety of quality coffees and meet the people behind what makes Houndstooth unique.  You will never taste the same thing twice, as the coffee here changes, as it should.  It was nice to come out of the class learning a couple of things.  I liked their new sister label Tweed.  If you like a quality cup, and want to know more about what you are drinking, this is the place to come. See all photos from Mindy H. for Houndstooth Coffee ", pos

Houndstooth Coffee ," 6/20/2014 2 check-ins Nice coffee shop on Lamar next to Uchiko and now one downtown.  Pretty well made coffees with the perfect touch of crema on the espresso shots and baristas who know what they are doing.   They carry stuff from Counter culture and Madcap and it is always interesting to taste an espresso there and then rush over to other places (literally with all that caffeine..) and try it again there.    The nice thing is that they also offer a small variety of non-dairy alternatives for the vegetarians among us.  I particularly like the coffee with mint and a splash of selzer (I think that's their eponymous specialty) which is quite refreshing in the summer.  All in all, a pretty good place to swing by for caffeine or downers in form of beer and wine. ", pos

Houndstooth Coffee ," 5/8/2015 While there are several locations, the location I tried was on the first floor of the Frost office building on Congress Ave, on a corner. It is small and sophisticated, and reminds me a lot of my favorite coffee shop in Ann Arbor, Michigan called Sweetwater Coffee. I don't drink coffee so I had the hot chocolate, which was made with real cocoa. When I complimented the wood bar, the barista told me that the bar, tables, and floor were all made from one pecan tree. ", pos

The coffee shop is in the lobby of the iconic Frost tower, but is quite comfortable and not too corporate. There is even a nice outdoor sitting area.  The baristas are friendly and know what they are doing. The coffee is always exceptional. Their espresso machine is beautiful. This is clearly a shop run by people who know and love good coffee.  As always, I like to try a cortado or a macciato. It was so good that i had to ask for a second one. There are many good coffee shops in downtown Austin, Houndstooth is clearly one of the best.

Houndstooth Coffee ," 3/9/2015 Houndstooth is well lit, good coffee, and plays 90s and 2000s hip hop & rap classics by artists like DMX, Tupac, Nelly, etc.  Sound like your jam?  This came well recommended by a friend so went here twice during my short stint in ATX. They serve Counter Culture coffee, so it's as local as you can get.  Location is odd/tucked in, but this is 2015 and y'all have Google Maps, so I'm not worried about that.  My only hesitation here is no almond milk offerings, little snacks/pastries, and price ($4.60 for a latte). ", pos 
Houndstooth Coffee ," 6/10/2015 I went to have breakfast today but found out is a coffee shop. The coffee made up for not getting what I was looking for.

Houndstooth Coffee ," 2/17/2015 1 check-in I'm a huge coffee fan.  Austin has a bunch of coffee shops so you can imagine my excitement and list of coffee shops for this trip. My love for coffee is not always the coffee alone. I actually love going to coffee shops, especially ones with lots of uniqueness and characters to it. Ones that don't try to hard and have down to earth baristas that can teach you a thing or two about coffee, like this Houndstooth location.  Hidden behind a bookstore, Houndstooth is a very tiny shop. We couldn't locate it from the main street. We were greeted by the most awesome girl. She had blonde hair, a great style, and super friendly. She moved from Oakland to Austin a couple years ago (hi girl!).  She was very helpful and helped add to our list of things to see/do. The coffee itself was great. The aroma was wonderful and taste great.  I recommend grabbing your cup of joe from this shop if you are in the area! ", pos

I was working at a venue for SXSW across the street and the 18 hour work days were long. When there was anywhere between 5 -20 minutes of a break, you bet your bottom dollar I was here.  It's really quite simple if you ask me why!  Well, the clean lines of the coffee shop made my wannaknowmore about interior design heart skip a beat. The company around seemed to be all young professionals working comfortable on laptops or reading.  The coffee was full and rich - oh my gosh. There are plenty of options no matter what kind of coffee drinker you are.  Best part? The baristas. They were consistently kind - like genuinely kind and truly cared you got the right drink for you.  This is my new favorite coffee spot in Austin. What what! ", pos 
Houndstooth Coffee , 3/5/2015 Delicious coffee in my honest opinion. The espresso really carries a smooth flavor. I paid $4.50 (plus $2 tip) for an 8 oz cortado...  ...That wasn't even made with Beyoncé's breast milk so $4.50 for 8 ounces of milk and espresso can't be justified. , neutral

Houndstooth Coffee ," 2/22/2014 1 check-in Listed in Caffeine Boost Huge fan of this Houndstooth location. The space is much larger, and the colors are warmer than its counterpart on N. Lamar, but you get the same, excellent coffee.  You can choose between the aeropress and the clever dripper as your method of choice, and you can still pick between two different beans. Gregory, the barista working at the time, was really friendly, and I also saw him patiently (and excitedly) explain the different coffee choices to others who came in. Kudos to you!  What I did love about this location is the atmosphere. It's very bright and open with plenty of seating. I came on a Saturday, which is typically less busy than the rest of the week since the usual business crowd aren't working.  There are only two cons to this location for me: 1) It's downtown, so you're gonna have to pay for parking. 2) They have keys for the bathrooms here - I hate it when coffee shops do this, it's like begging for germs to be spread since people don't always wash their hands. The baristas will touch these keys as well..I hope they get cleaned. This is me being a germaphobe.  As a stand alone shop, for sure one of the best in Austin. Prices are higher than other places in Austin, but you get quality. ", pos

Houndstooth Coffee ," 3/5/2014 1 check-in $3.90 is really pricy for green tea, but I do have to admit that this place excels in being trendy and comfortable. Their tea is also served in a minipot, so it is larger than your typical Starbucks serving. Gunpowder green tea ", neutral 
Houndstooth Coffee ," 5/23/2014 Some of the friendliest baristas you'll find around here! Espresso is fantastic and they offer two different single origin coffees at a time. I got a cortado with their Tweed beans (Colombia) and the chocolatey notes became more distinct the longer I drank it. They sell Askinosie chocolate, a small bean-to-bar single origin chocolate, which is great for pairing. The coffee shop offers indoor and outdoor seating and readily accessible.  Also the bathroom keys use frothing pitchers for key chains which is pretty hilarious. Cappuccino and cortado ", pos 
Houndstooth Coffee ," 2/19/2014 1 check-in First of all, the barista is not the most friendly person in the world. I would even go as far as to say she was downright rude.  If you've never been there before it's extremely confusing and even if you're standing right in front of her she wont acknowledge you until you just tell her what you want. As you can imagine, if you dont even KNOW what you want this can be frustrating. She didn't even look up at us when we quite obviously walked up to the counter right in front of her. The weird part about it is there wasnt a menu even posted so when I walked up to her I actually needed help. She didnt say one word and I just looked around until I found something that looked like a menu. That is definitely not how I want to start any day. Obviously, I havent HAD coffee yet (since I'm there to receive my java fix), please dont piss me off this early...  The coffee was good which gives this place one star and the atmosphere was nice which gives me the other 2 stars. They need to work on, I dunno, smiling for starters and maybe basic communication can be next on the list. Customer service would give this place a firm 4 star rating and having a menu to make this whole proc ess quick and smooth would land this place a 5 star easily but...they definitely did not do that this time.  I may give this place one more shot, or just stick to Jo's off of SoCo since they're awesome all the time and know how to say ""hi"" when customers walk up. ", neutral 
Houndstooth Coffee ," 10/13/2013 1 check-in Wanted to check out some of Austin's finest in regards to coffee and houndstooth came up on quite a few lists.  The space was nice and there was an outdoor front area we enjoyed thoroughly. On Sunday around noon there were plenty of seats and no wait. The coffee was good and what you'd expect from a business serious about coffee, but nothing to blow me away and warrant a return trip.  We ordered a morning bun, Mexican chocolate donut, and a couple of lattes. The barista wasn't that helpful in helping me to figure out what to order, but it seemed like he tried by asking if I had any questions and describing some of their selection.  The place, service, and cost, is good, not great. It was pricey and I walked away regretting the extra 15% tip. I wouldn't return, because I just wasn't that impressed. What I liked most was the space.  Coffee: good; pastries: good; space: good; service: ok. Overall: good.  I'm hoping others walk away with a better impression. ", neutral 
Houndstooth Coffee ," 9/5/2013 1 check-in Listed in Yelp 100 Challenge in 365 days I actually came to Houndstooth after the Hot Lava Obstacle Course event. I was curious about being a coffee geek. The event was called Coffee Geekery and I had to go. All I know about coffee was Folgers was crap and I bought anything was not Folgers or the cheap coffee for that matter. Yes I was aware there different types of coffee from different countries. But I didn't realize there was more to coffee than expected such as the aftertaste, the feeling, the balance, etc. Coffee sampling or cuppery is maybe what wine tasting is about.

Houndstooth Coffee ," 7/3/2014 2 check-ins First things first, I've been here for coffee nearly everyday I've worked in Austin. I love the environment, the location and the workers here. Coffee variety is pretty interesting, they have many unique drinks a place like Starbucks would lack.  My one complaint is that with so many unique drinks they also fall kinda short on some typical coffee flavored like hazelnut. On top of that, some of the specialty drinks can be a little pricier...  But it is at the base of the frost bank tower, one of the nicest buildings in Austin and near a lot of financial corporate organizations. My point is, people are willing to spend a little more money.  Overall I'd recommend this place. It's pretty great just not perfect for me Very nice setting right outside of houndstooth to sit and enjoy a coffee with a friend ", pos 
Houndstooth Coffee ," 10/12/2014 To me, this Houndstooth location sums up Austin perfectly. Having lived in and around Dallas/Fort Worth for the past five years, I had just started taking it as a given that a bank tower's ground floor coffee shop is a Starbucks. It's so refreshing to finally see an amazing local coffee shop in a great location.  Having only been to this location once and on a Friday, I don't know if my experience was typical. Given my experience with their location on Lamar, I have a feeling that this one stays really busy all day. If you want your pick of Tacodeli breakfast taco, get here early. When I was here just after 8, they had already sold out of most of them.  I tried the Japanese Iced Coffee which was the first time I have seen this type of iced coffee on a menu here in Texas. Houndstooth knocked it out of the park. I'm not a huge iced/cold brew coffee fan, but when it's 90+ outside, this will definitely be added to my coffee rotation. ", pos

I decided to try the Mexican Mocha which is always one of my favorite coffees and they did a great job with it.  There is parking in front of the store.  Hopefully when the remodeling and construction is done there will be seats inside and somewhere to sit down and enjoy a cup of coffee and possibly check out the bikes.  Right now there is a lot of dust so it is more of a grab and go.

Across cesar chavez (on the south side.. the south side) you walk in this tiny store attached to a book(?)shop or something and you initially question whether you're in the right place.  Yes you are.  They serve espresso based drinks only, so if you're expecting some 47 flavors of cappafrappa sugar crap with ten million options of coffee flavored sugar, don't come here. If you genuinely like the taste of a perfect espresso pour and a cappuccino with the little heart design with it's cuteness only to be exceeded by it's taste, don't miss out.

But I took off stars because this place was really hard to find, had no place to park, and no place to sit!!!! It's a teeny little hipster shop and catered more for the grab-n-go customers, affirmed by their simple menu.

Flat Track Coffee ," 3/12/2016 Love this place! We are new to Austin and have been working on exploring the city and trying out locally owned businesses. The entry is cute and quaint and the inside is perfect.  It is right in the middle of an up and coming neighborhood. We were able to park on the street right by the entrance but there is also a large parking lot right by the entrance if street parking is full. There is a small coffee bar inside that 1 or 2 people can sit at. Other than that, it is just a small espresso machine, am extremely friendly coffee maker and an iPad to check people out on. I love how simple it is.  This is definitely a place for coffee enthusiasts who don't need a bunch of syrup and flavoring put in there coffee. We had we both a Mexican mocha which was amazing. The flavoring was just right but it did not overpower the flavor of the actually espresso. The gentlemen working was so nice and was kind enough to discuss places we should make sure to go to and how to handle SXSW.  All in all we had a great experience. Sometimes these small local places can feel awkward and uncomfortable to anyone who isn't a regular, but this was the exact opposite.

Flat Track Coffee ," 6/28/2015 Let me start by saying this place is THE FREAKING MECCA OF HIPSTER COFFEE SHOPS! I mean that in the best way possible. Every morning you can see hipsters making their pilgrimage to Flat Track. Bearded men and tattooed women alike bicycle, scooter, and hike by the droves to flat track for their daily dosage of caffeine; you can set your watch by it.  Their popularity is no coincidence neither. Flat Track has incredible attention to detail. They roast their own beans and the proof is in the pudding - they serve some of the best coffee in town. I typically order a cappuccino - their espresso is done well and their latte art is always on point.  My only complaint is that this place can sometimes feel a little too ""scene-y"". Its a tiny little shop and everyone seems to know one another. My suggestion is where a jean or leather jacket and strike up conversation with the barista real quick, before they realize you're not part of the club ;) .  But in all seriousness, the coffee is great. The people there are nice. I only wish it was a little bit larger space and felt more inviting. ", pos 
Flat Track Coffee ," 6/29/2015 This isn't the type of place you would go to do homework or read a book (although you can), but rather a place to go sit, drink a coffee, and make conversation with anyone that walks through the door or the baristas of this intimate coffee shop. Small and hard to find, but once you do find it, you will be happy you did. Great almond milk lattes, and mini GF, vegan donuts to dunk! Not to mention, very pet-friendly, and there is usually a cute dog hanging out somewhere in the midst. ", pos

Flat Track Coffee ," 3/22/2015 Adorable teeny place, perfectly cute inside for everything you need in a coffee joint.  Cute inside, perfect decor, a little motorcycle attitude, really cute outside mural with bar seating and stools.  Lovely, warm service even though I was a tourist.  I had slightly better (and bigger) lattes elsewhere, but this was such a solid place, I do recommend if you're a coffee addict like I am, in Austin, and want to get out of the grind. ", pos

Flat Track Coffee ," 5/2/2013 First to Review Flattrack Coffee continues on the track (pun #1, done) of microroasting in gentrified parts of town within the confines of simplicity, rustic branding, and a little bit of technology mixed in via social media.  They currently crank out two beans for patrons to drink, and the storefront is as low maintenance as it gets. Tucked on a side street right off of Cesar Chavez and I-35, no sign draws you in. You gotta be ""in the know"", which makes me feel all the more hip; unfortunately, I do not ride my bike into the Eastside. The storefront has a couple of stools and a brewing station, and that's about it--it does not need more. It provides enough space to have a great conversation.  The two bags in stock, for your home-brewing purposes: Colombia Finca Miranda and Rwanda Dukunde Kawa. The former lends itself to a vibrant, clean taste, not unlike citrus. The latter affords the drinker a more full-bodied cup, with more distinguished fruit nuances.  At less than $20 a bag, these beans will definitely get you going for all of the fantastic pricing, good service, and heartfelt roasting that comes along with purchasing a bag.  Oh, and I felt super hip buying one of their $5 hankies/bar towels. I don't know if I actually have a use for it in my household, but why the heck not? It is branded with their logo. Homebrewing. Thanks, Flattrack! ", pos

That's gotta be some good coffee.    Nestled in the back of a book and misc. wares store, Flat Track's no frills appearance is a testament unto themselves.  All you can do is order coffee.  And the coffee is great!    I'm not a coffee expert, and I do cringe a bit at paying over 3 bucks for a wee cup of joe, but this coffee is amazing stuff.  It's light in body, flavor and really smooth.  It's also pure rocket fuel.  3 sips and I feel like I could punch through a wall.  So it's my new post-boozy brunch spot.    They also sell their really awesome coffee beans, but I may lack the skills, equipment, and patience to brew it like they do. ", pos

Flat Track Coffee ," 12/13/2014 Great espresso.  It compares favorably to Cafe Medici and Houndstooth, which to my palate are the best in town.  Flat Track roasts its own beans at a location in south Austin and it shows.  I believe the person in charge of roasting used to be a general manager at Ritual Coffee Roasters in San Francisco.  You can also buy beans from them; you can't beat fresh roasted without any shipping delay.  They favor a medium roast, which I strongly prefer because it tends to better balance and present a wide range of flavors in the roast.  Some people prefer the flavors of a dark roast in their espresso, but do yourself a favor and give medium roasted beans a try at least once. ", pos 
Flat Track Coffee ," 10/21/2013 This is the most velvety-smooth-down-your-throat latte with that satisfying, full, bold and true espresso flavor that I've ever had here in the States.  One of my coffee barista/connoisseur friends brought me here and introduced me to what New Wave coffee SHOULD and CAN taste like.  No bitter/burnt after taste at all - good brew shouldn't need sugar.  Genuine and personable staff who invest in the art of coffee - good people!  It's a very small shop - a few bar chairs and the rest is standing room.  Not your typical coffee shop where you go and bring your laptop and books, but I think that's part of the charm since the focus is primarily on making you that good coffee.    Whole milk is used for the hot steamed milk and do expect a cute little latte heart art:)  If you are new, there is no menu when you walk in.  Generally, I leave about $5 and a tip for a cup - talk to the barista to make sure.  I love taking my friends here because it's unique and one-of-a-kind, and not to mention right next door to Las Cruzes and Farewell Books.  I'll be back over and over again. ", pos

Flat Track Coffee ," 8/2/2014 Best Coffee in Town? Check Babes? Double Check Babe-alicious owner with awesome hair and a great dog? Triple Check    Flat Track has it all. Tucked away in a strange, curated bookstore, this exceptional caffeination station serves up hands-down the best latte you can get on any block in Austin (the block has a few coffees places on it, with another having just sprouted up down the street, all of which pale in comparison to the energizing elixir the brewin' betches at the fabulous Flat Track perfectly produce). To brew their beans, they employ a nuclear physicist/mad scientist named Amanda who rides a motorcycle and has a pet alligator.    The bookstore--who's name I don't even know, so I like to pretend it is nameless for edginess' sake--will provide all the intellectual stimulation your brain can possibly absorb while you sip away at the best $%@&ing coffee this side of the Mason-Dixon. For all you boys out there: if you want to take your tinder date to a great spot pre day-bone, look no further than this locally-owned Austin classic.    Some people say it is hard to find, so let me make it easy for you: On the easterly-facing wall of the no-name bookstore mentioned erstwhile, there is a huge mural of a boy who has frozen to death reading David Foster Wallace's Infinite Jest. Flat Track is conveniently located to the left of this boys ear and immediately under his sombrero/derby cap.  See you there! ", pos

Just kept coming back every morning to perfect pulls of espresso and great times with the locals.

Flat Track Coffee ," 4/25/2014 This review is for the Flat Track inside of No Comply on 12th street.  The coffee is SO GOOD. I love the spare, minimalist, pared down menu. I've had espressos, americanos, and lattes here and it really is the best coffee I've had in Austin. The coffee never tastes burnt or harsh like it does other places. The baristas are always super nice to me and I love talking to them almost as much as I love the coffee. The baked goods look good, but I haven't sampled any. I have sampled the caramels, which are super good. A small latte will run you about $4. Not cheap, but way better than the cheap stuff. Also I have to confess that I love the aesthetic of their cups.  Almost no seating inside. This is not a place to come whittle away hours on the innernet. It is a great place to stop by, grab a cup, and go. The location inside of No Comply is really interesting, too, and if you were to linger by the window seats for a while I'm sure you'd see some interesting things. ", pos

There espresso is extremely dark, rich, and woody without tasting the slightest bit burnt or bitter.  Serious espresso fans will love this place; all others, probably not so much.  This is exclusively an espresso bar, and their espresso is not just the main attraction, but the only attraction.  The space is very nice, but tiny.  It's also (perhaps intentionally?) very difficult to find.  They have no signs.  The mural on the side of the building is what pointed me in the right direction.  The nondescript entrance definitely makes it feel that much more special, like you're in on a fantastic little secret to which the rest of this too-hip-to-function neighborhood is oblivious. ", pos

Pros: Cute little space, decent food, and friendly staff.  Cons: Vanilla and Chai latte = mehhhhh. The Vanilla latte tasted like it had wayyyyyy too much syrup and it was super milky with no coffee in it. Dirty Chai latte was probably the worst I've ever had in Austin. It didn't even taste like it had an extra shot of espresso in it. I was not a fan of this drink. Breakfast sandwich = were pretty basic and didn't impress. I see why they only charge $5 for their breakfast sandwiches. Really though? The breakfast sandwich was superrrrr basic and not worth paying $5, maybe $2-3 dollars.

They can make stuffed waffles with it and just makes life good.  We also got the big ass breakfast wrap, which stayed together like a champ until the last bite and was fantastic. We also got the smashed chickpea sandwich. Out of control good. I think my boyfriend at it about 10 seconds because he couldn't put it down.

Mary’s Cafe ," 2/24/2016 1 check-in Was looking for a place to have a ""healthy"" breakfast after eating tons of junk during a girl's weekend tip to Austin.  I found Mary's on Yelp and we headed over there - it's near UT so we were a little worried it might be crazy crowded with students but we were there at 9am on a Sunday so it wasn't bad.  It was getting sort'of busy by the time we left at around 9:45 but we walked right up and ordered.  I went with a banana peanut butter smoothie and ordered the red velvet waffle.  My friend ordered their sweet toast which consisted of wheat toast with cream cheese, sliced strawberries and honey.  My smoothie was good but had too much peanut butter for my taste.  The warm red velvet waffle was delicious with a dollop of sweet cream cheese and drizzle of chocolate and raspberry.  YUM.  It took a good 10-15 mins or so to get our food but it wasn't a terribly long wait.  I can see how they back up during busy times because there were about 10 people waiting when we left and if it took 10+ mins for each of their orders that can create a back-up!  I used the bathroom before we left and found a cute unisex bathroom down the hall that was neat and tidy.  Good location in a small shopping strip with some parking right in front.  They had some yummy sandwiches and other breakfast options that I'm sure are pretty good. Cute and tidy bathroom down the hall. Red velvet waffle. That's sweet cream cheese with chocolate and raspberry drizzle. Yep. Yum. ", pos

We didn't get to try the gelato pops, which look fantastic so hopefully we'll come back to try those soon.  We did a pecan and chocolate chip waffle, which we highly recommend! It was hot, crunchy and full of flavor. I'd avoid the sausage breakfast sandwich, and although the Ernie (mozarella, peppers, tomato) was large and a good value, it just didn't have a lot of flavor.

Mary’s Cafe ," 12/6/2015 1 check-in Brunch time!  Although being walking distance from UT campus, I never knew this place existed until a friend brought us here.  Driving or walking by, you can't miss their sign out front and their interior decor is just as interesting.  It's a small place with booths at the window, several small tables, and a couch.  What a place appropriate for Austin!  Their menu covers waffles, coffee, smoothies, sandwiches, tacos, and salads.  Seriously, all breakfast places should have a sampler dish available!  Their waffles looked pretty good so I ordered an Original Leige Waffle with chocolate chips mixed in and topped with bananas and strawberries.  Their online menu has a list of different waffles, but you really just make your own.  First impression when it came out was that it looks kind of small.  Don't worry, it isn't.  I definitely had to work my way through to the end and the fruit tasted fresh.  The waffle was a bit dense for me, so I might consider having the bananas mixed in or topped with a sauce the next time I get it.  The sandwiches also looked pretty good too, and you also get $2 off a breakfast sandwich when you check in!  Missed out on their Gelato Pops too, so another excuse to come back.  There's only one or two cooks, so the food will take a while to come out.  Make sure you're not in a rush.  I was the last of a group of 8 to order, and my waffle took about 30 minutes.  Nevertheless, service was great and so was the food.  If you find yourself on their website, take the time to read their heartwarming story!

Mary’s Cafe ," 8/1/2016 1 check-in Nice little spot (and I do mean little). Great breakfast sandwiches. I eat here about once a month, so I would consider myself a semi-regular, but not a regular-regular.  What would make this place 5 stars?  Better staffing/scheduling. Often only 1 person working during lunch rush, sometimes 2 people = slooowww service... I've learned to call in my order 15 min before I come, but for those of you who don't: there could be a long wait (15-30 min for a breakfast sandwich). The nice thing is that everything is made to order, which makes it delish... but that wait can kill someone's lunch break really quick.  Also, this seems petty (and it is), but I don't like that they are categorized as ""Miscellaneous Food Stores-Conv. Stores, Markets, Specialty Stores, and Vending"" under their Square/card processing services. It messes with my bonus points. Where I might normally get 2% or 5% back for using my card at a restaurant/dining establishment, I only get 1% here because they've categorized themselves as a food store/market. Boo to that.  Anyway... love the breakfast sandwiches, wish I could make it here once a week! ", pos

Mary’s Cafe , 11/14/2016 The big ass breakfast wrap is quite possibly the best breakfast burrito/taco I have EVER had. The flavors of every ingredient mix so well together and their salsa is just perfect for it. It is very filling and I highly advise adding the chicken to it. The liege waffles are also amazing and taste so fresh and are just the right combination of sugar and flour to make them not too grainy or too dry. One of the only places I have seen with this many combinations of waffles you can make as well at any given time and the price for quality of food and freshness is a steal! , pos 
Mary’s Cafe ," 10/17/2016 I woke up with an intense craving for a bagel, and after having my request denied at Republic of Sandwich because they do not serve breakfast past 11am (I contend that bagels are an all-day kind of food, but I digress), I decided to check out Mary's Cafe. It was cozy and quiet inside and had delightful Halloween decorations - the space alone made me want to come back to sit with some coffee and reading sometime when I feel overwhelmed with the hustle and bustle of other campus food options. I ordered a cream cheese, honey, and strawberry breakfast sandwich (on a bagel, of course) to go. I thought $7 seemed a bit steep, but I was delighted to unwrap a hefty sandwich practically overflowing with cream cheese and delicious, ripe strawberries that certainly recharged me for the rest of the day.

Mary’s Cafe ," 4/6/2015 1 check-in Decided to check this place out based on some other Yelp reviews and the fact that it was really close to campus. It's a small little hole in the wall. The day I stopped by there were a handful of people at the little tables and a single, very nice woman running the show.  I ordered a salad to go (Old City?) and was really impressed by how fast she was able to put it together for me. When I got home I opened the to-go box to find a lovely salad of mixed greens with slices of apples, pecans, dried cranberries and some bits of cheese. The dressing was tasty and a good addition to the salad. I love a good salad, like ""love it so much I want to marry it"" love. This was a good salad. Not the best I've had, but worth coming back.  The treats they have on offer were really hard to pass up. Seriously, saying no to a sweet waffle was the worst thing I did that day. Gelato pops! ", pos 
Mary’s Cafe ," 9/11/2015 3 check-ins Listed in Austin Eats on a College Budget, Just A Spoonful of Sugar I just really like breakfast. And finding breakfast close to the UT campus is kinda hard...you got Torchy's, Chick Fil A, Kerbey, but I wanted something MORE.  Enter Mary's Pop Shop. It's a small, cute cafe located on the way other side of campus (drive if you can), and they're neighbors with Cornucopia. They offer those standard cafe drinks, breakfast sandwiches, waffles, and gelato!!  I had the Avocado, Queso Fresco, Fried Egg breakfast sandwich, which is exactly what the name says. For those of you who don't know what queso fresco is (me), it's a creamy, soft cheese that looks like egg whites with a light cheese flavor. This is excellent for me because I'm not a fan of sharp cheeses. It's a pretty decent and dare I say healthy (?) breakfast (also comes with two orange slices!) for the price (around $5). But wait! If you Yelp check-in you can have this delicious breakfast sandwich for only like $3 something. Look at you being all thrifty.  Now what to do with the $2 you saved? BUY A GELATO POP ($3). Hello, this place is Mary's POP shop, and who turns down gelato for breakfast? Their flavors rotate and they usually have one vegan option (they had passion fruit last time). I tried their Oatmeal Cookie gelato pop and my oh my, that pop was DELICIOUS. It tasted exactly like the name and no it's not healthy even it says oatmeal!! But who cares! It tasted like a cookie in gelato form.  I will definitely be returning. If I can find someone to drive me again. :) ", pos 
Mary’s Cafe ," 8/20/2015 1 check-in Listed in But first, coffee. Mission find gelato pops in Austin: success!  Mary's is a super cute & hip cafe located about a 5 minute drive out from campus. Their menu consists of everything - from breakfast tacos, to waffles, to coffees, and don't forget the gelato pops.  What I've tried: - Salted Caramel Iced Coffee (2/5): I always order salted caramel at every coffee shop if they have the option, but this was mainly syrup, not so much coffee. I probably wouldn't order coffee here again. - Peanut Butter Pig (4/5): Yum! Banana stuffed waffle topped with peanut butter, sliced bacon (!!), and sliced bananas - Berry Mary (5/5): I was told that people order this the most and I can definitely see why! This is blueberry stuffed waffle topped with sweetened cream cheese and sliced strawberries  They make everything in-house and the waffles on the spot which is a-awesome! I'm definitely going back to try the gelato pops because what's a better dessert in this hot Texas weather?  There's a private lot out in front so you won't have to worry about parking and plenty of seating inside (plus wifi!)  Also, if you care enough to check out the story behind the name of the cafe on the website -- truly touching!  See you often, Mary! Berry Mary Belgian Waffle ", pos 
Mary’s Cafe ," 6/20/2016 Easily one of my favorite breakfast places in Austin. They have an array of healthy and not-so-healthy options. Avo/Queso sandwich is super tasty, fresh and simple. Lately, I've been getting the 'make your own breakfast sandwich' option. Super good as well -- especially the ciabatta bread! One of my friends I dragged along not too long ago had a salad and she said it was also tasty. Highly recommend their waffles if you have a sweet tooth. They have a lot of options and usually have some featured waffle special. Last time I went it was a churro waffle!  As far as price, I think it's super reasonable. A lot of the time people don't realize that small businesses don't have all the luxuries of larger restaurant chains. So don't except super cheap prices but instead expect reasonable prices that reflect the quality of their food. You can easily have a meal here for $10 - $12 max. Probably, less if you don't get extra stuff.  Wait times are on the long side. Again, a product of being a small business. It can especially get lengthy if they have more than a few people being served. It's a tiny place, and they usually only have two people working. They don't have a true kitchen so this also adds to the wait time. However, I think the food is completely worth the wait!  I only have two/three gripes with this place....  For one, I noticed that my order is made differently (and I'm not talking about taste) depending on who makes it. Sometimes my bread is toasted and some times the eggs are actually cooked over easy. Sometimes I get chips, sometimes I don't. Not a big deal. Just being nit picky.  Two, one of the guys working here is a bit stand offish and comes across a rude at times. Not a big deal as I'm not coming in for a social experience, but a little kindness goes a long way. And I'm not social by any means, so it's not like I'm trying to carry a conversation.... think I read in one of the reviews that this problem has been fixed.  Third, the hours can be VERY inconsistent. This probably one of the only major flaws with the place (it's not even that major). About 50% of time I've been here, it has been closed despite the displayed hours. Again, I do understand that it is a small business, but there needs to be some more consistency. It seems to happen often around lunchtime (which is when I usually come). I know that they sell out of stuff sometimes and they don't have a lot of employees. I highly recommend you call ahead to see if they're open (during non traditional breakfast hours).  All in all, exceptional food, plenty of options, quaint atmosphere, and reasonable prices. ", pos 
Mary’s Cafe ," 2/18/2015 1 check-in Listed in frozen! This is a pretty cute place, and sort of in a very random location near campus - I never would have noticed it if my friend hadn't told me about it. It is sort of a random restaurant with sort of a 1960s diner feel. There is an entire wall covered with pictures of ""Mary's"", which I found to be a cute twist on the restaurant's name. I heard the story of who Mary is from my friend, and it's super touching - ask the owner next time you're in!  I tried the gelato here, and it was pretty good - they handmake all of their gelato in the store. The chocolate chocolate chip is rich and delicious. The mint chocolate chip and cappucino flavors are a little bit lacking in flavor. The gelato has a really ""sticky"", pull-apart texture, almost like eating cake batter, which I find to be interesting!  I'll be sure to be back to try the gelato pops & waffles and the various breakfast sandwiches (there is one involving cream cheese and strawberries, and it is definitely on my radar).  I'll be sure to stop by again some day. (: chocolate chocolate chip ", pos 
Mary’s Cafe ," 9/11/2015 We've had this catered several times at my workplace and it always arrives promptly and they set up everything for you.  The breakfast tacos are my favorite, actually they look like cute mini burritos. They offer several options including a few with avocado in them, which is my favorite! Also, the salsa is super yummy as well.  The waffles (not sure exactly what they are called) are mini waffles with some sort of syrup baked into it. They are heaven!  I've also had their sandwiches and ice cream and everything has always been fresh and tasty! Check them out for sure! Egg, avocado, and cheese breakfast taco with their salsa ", pos

Mary’s Cafe ," 1/13/2015 3 check-ins We came here after eating at an Italian place with no gelato on the dessert menu.  Seriously?  Yelp to the rescue.  I think there were 8 or 10 different flavors of gelato.  And granted, this wasn't just your plain old raspberry, vanilla, chocolate, whatever.  This had character.  The raspberry was mixed with homemade ladyfingers.  Yum!  And the vanilla was mixed with their homemade chocolate chips.  There was even popcorn with the yummy stuff from Cornucopia next door.  I can't remember all of them, but they were delicious.  I decided on the Fruit Loop (raspberry with ladyfingers). It was delicious.    My date had the vanilla chocolate chip gelato (can't remember the fancy name) & one of their homemade chocolate banana waffles.  OMG was it good.    This place is still pretty new (open a couple of months) & their selection is growing. I think I'd like to try one of their breakfast options next time.  I'll be back!

Mary’s Cafe ," 7/2/2015 8 check-ins Listen, fellow yelpers, there is not one ""bad"" thing about this spot - WAIT!  They are closed on Sundays through July... that breaks my food lovin heart - but they're beyond awesome, other than that. Ken, the owner has got to be one of the hardest working, food love giving, awesome music playing, gelato pop making folks out there!   The menu is simple, but oh so tasty and really does have endless possibilities with just basic, fresh and tasty options to mix, match and combine.   The waffles are fresh made and oh so damn good.  They're Liège waffles and, until you have Liège waffles, you haven't had the best.  You can fill them or top them or BOTH with everything from nutella to blueberries to chocolate to pecans... and so much more! There's lovely espresso drinks, even one with Ken's made from scratch gelato in it... DECADENT! Breakfast sandwiches can be created to your liking, or simply chose one of the great concoctions they have assembled. Breakfast tacos are a plenty, as well. Lunch?  Oh, Mary's has got that covered, honey... there are grilled wraps that are mouth watering delish, as well as lovely salads. Oh, and that gelato I told you about that Ken makes?  Yeah... that is the stuff my kids fight over.  The gelato pops are just too srumdiddlyumptious to even think about not having... and having every flavor over time.   All in all, Mary's is my go to spot for any meal of they day and I know it'll be fresh, made from scratch and made with so much foodie love that the foodie angels sing praises from the parted clouds above.

Mary’s Cafe ," 11/3/2014 3 check-ins Listed in ""Oh Mama, You So Sweet!"", ""I Have Ethos, Have Some Pathos..."", The ""I Scream for Ice Cream"" list... So when I was a fat kid, I learned to do three things really well:  1. Make people laugh. 2. Field strip, clean, and reassemble a Colt Government M-1911 .45 ACP. 3. Sit & shoot a pencil out of my stomach, with unerring accuracy, up to seven feet.  The point is I'm deadly serious now about desserts & sweets, because I'm acutely aware of what I consume these days and how often I consume it. And also, fat kids may be all smiley and laughing around you, but what they really want to do is blow your brains out. This may be TMI.  But it does segue nicely to Mary's Pop Shop. Unfortunately when I was there, the actual ""gelato pop"" portion of the menu wasn't quite ready yet, although it should be in place by the time you read this. But there were four types of gelato available, with three kinds of giant gelato/cookie concoctions, which all looked good but exceeded my calorie calculations. So I went with a tarragon chicken salad sandwich. And it was a really good tarragon chicken salad sandwich. Huge breast chunks, grapes & pecans? Subtle mayo spicing & celery? Yeah, that works for me.    It also appears to be a one-man operation, with him doing everything, and his website story is touching. The shop itself is cool. The coffee smells great. I'm curious now about the morning ""Breakfast toast"" specials, and how slammed he'll be during peak hours. But what impressed me the most was when he took my money, gave me change, but then washed his hands, put on gloves, and made my tarragon chicken salad sandwich. You know stuff we take for granted? Don't.  So right now, I'm a fan of Mary's Pop Shop, and I haven't even tasted the gelato yet. My instinct here is to let the newness diffuse a bit, let the tweaks settle in, and give this place a chance to catch its breath. And then pop in for a gelato update. I'm calculating the moments. New Belgian Waffle, and a signature gelato pop, strawberry shortcake style... Chicken salad sandwich. Unexpectedly great! ", pos 
Mary’s Cafe ," 11/7/2015 2 check-ins Mary's is a sweet little gem in North Campus. It's a pretty small establishment but definitely very homey and cute. I came on a Thursday with two friends for brunch and all three of us ordered the sliced avocado quest fresco with egg breakfast sandwich. We redeemed the Yelp offer of $2 off breakfast sandwiches and one friend and I added bacon and the second friend added sausage for $1. We all enjoyed the sandwiches, they were very fresh (in fact we could see the guy making it from start to finish behind the register). We originally came thinking we'd get one of their famous gelato pops for dessert, but alas we were informed that the freezer had broken the day before and many of their pops had melted. There were two flavors available but they didn't entice us enough to buy so we left without. We'll come again to try a pop next time! ", pos

I tried a bacon, avocado,  egg taco and their basic leige waffle (apparently what they are known for). The taco was made fresh, you could taste the egg being recently cooked as it came off the pan. The waffle was amazing. I am not too much of a fan of waffles but it's chewy goodness sent me back to the days when I was a little child experiencing my mothers  warm and soothing hot chocolate when I came back from primary school.

I ordered the breakfast sandwich with sliced avocado, queso fresco, and a fried egg with a coffee.  My mom ordered the turkey bacon wrap with iced tea and my dad ordered the peanut butter pig waffles and coffee.  We figured we covered a little something of everything.  When the food came out we quickly took tasting turns and everything was so yummy!    It's amazing that bacon would taste so good with bananas and peanut butter cream cheese on the waffles.  The bacon turkey wrap was full of flavor and the tortilla wrap wasn't rubbery or heavy tasting.  The breakfast sandwich had a perfectly cook egg, not too soft and runny and not to hard and crumbly, but just right.  The avocado and queso gave it a buttery type taste especially on the lightly toasted multi grain bread.  The coffee was delicious, I didn't even have to dress it up because of the flavor.  The iced tea was excellent and had a minty taste.  The servings are perfectly sized to make sure you leave room for gelato by the cup or a pop.  The peanut butter and jelly pop was very delicious.

Mary’s Cafe ," 5/11/2016 I'll start off by saying my avocado and fried egg sandwich was delicious. However, my experience there, not so much. I walk in and place my order, he says it's $6.48 so I pay and leave a tip. While I'm waiting for my order, I notice a display that says ""Build your own breakfast sandwich"" $3.50 (plus $1 for avocado). So, If i would have picked that, my sandwich would have been $4.50 instead of $5.99. I tell the guy that helped me (Ross), hmm that's interesting and he says, what is?

The guys that work the counter are always so chill and nice, and the space to wait or eat is quaint, cute, and clean.

Mary’s Cafe ," 1/17/2015 Mary's is one of those hidden gems that everyone in Austin should be talking about.  It only opened a few months ago, but the staff has already tapped into something special and our taste buds and arteries are smiling for it.  What is it exactly?  Well, a little bit of everything.  This is one of those joints that seems to do everything right.  I have never had gelato this good anywhere before.  The chocolate is my favorite of the regular flavors.  The owner offers seasonal options as well which rotates on a fairly regular basis.  The pumpkin in the Fall was out of this world.  In addition, there are a great number of toppings that you can add to your gelato.  The coffee and espresso is as good as anywhere else in the city and compliment the gelato very nicely.  The wraps are tremendous.  The vegetables are extremely fresh, the eggs cooked to perfection and the use of correct sauces with each wrap make every option a correct one.  It really makes you wonder how Jimmy Johns next door could even stay in business.  Once everyone working in the area learns about Mary's, I bet ole' Jimmy moves to another side of town because right now Mary is kicking his ass.  Lastly are the pops themselves.  I had no idea what to expect since my experience has only been with store bought pops.  Comparing what Mary's sells to what you can pick up at HEB is like comparing fine dining to fast-food.  The pops are like a work of art with different layers of culinary pleasure to satisfy,  I've had the peanut butter and the strawberry.  I think they both made me moan in public like I was Meg Ryan.  The owner is a great guy who is very cordial and helpful when trying to make your selections.  He always puts on gloves when making your food and throws them away as soon as he's done.  How often do you get to see that?  Finally, the story behind Mary's is pretty amazing.  I won't ruin it for you here, so I enourage you to stop by, order a wrap, grab one of the pamphlets that tells the story, kick back, read and then top it off with a pop/gelato and cup of coffee.  Your taste buds will be happy that you did. ", pos

Mary’s Cafe ," 11/24/2014 Updated review 5 check-ins Fantastic...again! I finally found my way over on that side of town. Well, actually I drove 20 minutes out of my way to go to Mary's Pop Shop. I had a hankering for some true gelato. When I got there, I conveniently remembered that I had not had breakfast yet. So I decided to have the breakfast sandwich with fresh sliced avocado, tomato, crumbled feta cheese, fried egg on toast. I love how everything Ken, the owner and chef, makes is so fresh. Gosh, that sandwich was so good. Remembering that I had come in for some gelato, (of course after I ate the entire sandwich) I decided to get the gingersnap cookie with cappuccino gelato sandwich. I ate it as I drove away, happily,with the Rittenhouse salad, sitting next to me, that I was going to have for dinner. So, Yep, I pretty much ate breakfast lunch and dinner with Mary's pop shop. The cookie was amazing, The cappuccino gelato in the cookie sandwich was smooth and delicious. Eating while driving, was not the smartest thing I've done. But, dang, it was so good. When I got home I put the Rittenhouse salad in the refrigerator and went to a couple of appointments. Later that evening, I had my Rittenhouse salad. The homemade balsamic vinaigrette is fresh and perfect. The nice fresh mescaline greens with the candied nuts and cranberries mixed with the homemade balsamic vinaigrette was the perfect ending to my Sunday. I think I'm going to try to figure out a way to be on that side of town this week for a gelato pop. I can't get enough of this place. There's just something about fresh, homemade, inspiring food that beckons me to return. Sliced avocado queso fresco and a fried egg--amazing!!!! ", pos

Sadly the freezer was just being replaced, so I was not able to try the acclaimed gelato pops, which was a shame seeing as I made this off-path excursion for this very reason. If a local or staying near the campus, definitely try it, but if from out of town aka: visiting from out of state, would probably give it a miss if staying in the city center without a car. ", pos

Mary’s Cafe ," 2/5/2015 I tried Mary's for lunch today on a whim instead of Jimmy Johns a couple doors down. Sadly, I was pretty disappointed and won't be back again.  I ordered the Honey Mustard Chicken grilled wrap, which came with tortilla chips as a side (but no salsa... Wtf? Might as well serve it with potato chips). When I got the wrap home literally 5 minutes after the guy handed it to me (I took it to go because the restaurant is too awkwardly small to dine in), I opened the foil to find that it was barely even warm. The wheat wrap was faintly golden from the sandwich press but the contents were COLD and the provolone cheese wasn't melted at all. Additionally, the wrap was dripping with honey mustard -- WAYYY overkill.  I think this place could be better with some minor improvements (salsa with the chips, less honey mustard, more time on the grill), but it certainly wasn't worth my money and I won't be going back.

Anderson’s Coffee Company ," 7/4/2016 Listed in Austin Essentials, Can They Kick It?, Austin Time Warp/Freak Show Anderson's Coffee is one of those little places, growing steadily more rare, that represents not only someone's livelihood but his passion as well. Step into this place, with its soft and creaky wood-plank floor, and be welcomed into Mr. Anderson's heart and spiritual home.  Anything you bring home from Anderson's will be permeated with the aroma of the fine coffee they've been roasting there for the last 20 years at least. Besides coffee and loose-leaf tea by the pound, Anderson's carries temptations in many other guises as well. So what if you've never used or needed a teapot in your life. How can you pass up the one shaped like a hunting octopus? Or the bars of best Belgian chocolate, the twelve flavors of marmalade, the cookies from another land, the fire-engine red French press?  I hit Anderson's right after payday and stock up on coffee for the month. The trip takes up more than my lunch hour, and many other more convenient places now have similarly excellent fresh-roasted coffee for a little cheaper.  But none of those places is Anderson's. Always for me the trip is worth the time. ", pos

I came here to get some coffee by the lb and absolutely fell in love. This is the cutest little coffee place. First, when you walk in you are greeted by the delicious smell of fresh coffee and the smiling faces of the employees. The employees were very helpful and knowledgable about the different coffees offered. They have lots of chocolate available, the cutest mugs and espresso cups, and lots of other things to look at/buy on your stop in. Not to mention they are born and raised in Austin!:)via love buying local.  If I could change one thing-the only thing, it would be that they had a cute little area to sit outside and enjoy the a cup of coffee. Still gets 5 stars though!

Anderson’s Coffee Company ," 11/23/2015 This is such an interesting place, I'm honestly completely split down the middle on my review. The short of it is that their coffee was really good, the shop was super interesting but the counter service was complete disorganized anarchy, and they didn't have anything available to taste.  So, the long of this starts with my friend and I coming in on a Thursday afternoon. We enter this small unassuming coffee roaster - which of course, I looked up on Yelp. We try to find little artisan shops to go to and look at and support, and this one seemed perfect. As soon as we entered, we were enchanted by the lovely smell of freshly roasted beans, the thousands of coffee cups and coffee accessories lining with walls of the dark wood paneled shop, as well as the dazzling displays of candies and cookies from what appeared to be Europe. Really, up front it was impressive. So, we took the time to wander the store from front to back - and as we did so, we started to sort of notice that there were a lot of people hovering around the main counter in this really disorganized fashion. They were ordering coffee, it appeared.  We hadn't been greeted by anyone yet, having been walking around the shop for a good 5-10 minutes, so we stood sort of in the middle of the shop, waiting our  turn for up at the counter. I had decided that I would ask a bunch of questions about their roasts and I was hoping that they would have tastings. Well, people were walking in all around us, we were super in the way - but there was nowhere else to be while we waited our turn. Several people pushed past us and went to the each side of us and stood there waiting for their turn - it was really chaotic.  After a few minutes, it appeared we were next. We stepped up to the bar-like counter and told the guy that this was our first time and I asked if they had tastings or what coffees he recommended, etc. He said that there were two coffees available for tasting, that were to the far right of the counter in large carafes, but otherwise they just sold beans. Ok... so he did ask me what types of coffee I usually like, (dark) and did have two recommendations - but they were out of the one he would generally recommend. So, I bit the bullet and I bought a half pound of whole bean of the Viennese Blend. By that time there was a lady standing next to us with cash in hand and people behind us as well. So, I felt rushed and took my coffee and stepped off to the side to try a quick sip of their coffees available to taste. They weren't labelled as far as I could see, so I picked one. It was unfortunately massively bitter - I'm not sure if it had been sitting there all day or not. Based upon that sip, this would be a two star review.  I did get home, and grind my whole beans and I am currently making my way through the half pound of the Viennese Blend and I actually very much like it. It isn't bitter or acidic and has nice balance. They definitely seem to have a lot of regulars and quite the following which is great. I'm awarding three stars - I'd really love to see more tasting options here, and better service for those who come in and it is their first visit. Otherwise, the coffee is solid and I'll probably be back to buy more. ", neutral

Anderson’s Coffee Company ," 1/21/2016 Where has this place been my whole ATX life?! Oh, wait...it's been right here, where it's been since 1972 (I believe that's what they told me.) Yet another gem of central Austin tucked away in a corner just waiting to be discovered and henceforth treasured as one of the best parts of this city. I'm currently a little hopped up on their Flores roast - which is delicious - so I'm going to try not to ramble. Let me just bullet point this bad boy...  - Great location! A little out of the way so you're not on a busy street, but in a really cute little shopping center with its own parking lot so it's easy to park & walk around the other stores.  - The store itself is adorable. So many coffee cups, y'all. French presses, fancy coffee goodies, biscotti, you get the idea. They also have tea & accoutrements like tea pots, but I'm a coffee girl and I don't know much about all that.  - $1 cup of coffee. Let that sink in a second. They brew one regular and one decaf roast each day and sell it for a buck a cup. This alone makes it worth stopping by.  - Excellent selection of fresh roasted coffee. I'm told they roast on Mondays and Thursdays so no matter when you go in you're getting the freshy-fresh. So. Many. Choices. Their menu board is well-organized & labeled. If you know what you like you can easily find it including fair trade & organic. Also...  - Awesome staff! Everyone was so nice & very helpful as well as extremely knowledgable. They can help you choose the best coffee for a given application (like, ""I want to be kickstarted in the morning and I use a French press."") They can also grind your coffee the ideal way for your brewing method of choice.  I kind of already can't wait to go back! I was on a mission today & needed to get my loot and get back to work, but I will be back because this is now my coffee purveyor of choice! ", pos 
Anderson’s Coffee Company ," 10/5/2015 This is where I buy my coffee in Austin. The staff are knowledgeable and fantastically friendly. They have a varied and seasonal selection of the worlds best coffee beans roasted to perfection. Fair-trade and organic easily labeled, if that's your thing. A massive selection of candy from all over the world and drip coffee sold by the cup -- you get a cup free if you buy a pound of coffee.  They're super competitively priced. I can't stress that enough. You cannot find better single origin whole beans in Austin for cheaper. However they do it, keep doing it. You've got a customer for life. In a town inundated with $2 shots of espresso. Anderson's is a blue-collar breath of fresh air.  Which leads me to my favorite part -- there's no espresso machine in sight. None. They don't have one.

Anderson’s Coffee Company ," 11/6/2015 First visit here walking in and was blasted, in the best way possible, by the aroma of decades of fresh roasted coffee. Everyone was very friendly and helpful.

Anderson’s Coffee Company ," 10/14/2015 1 check-in Listed in Shop Till You Drop!, A Trip to Texas I love Anderson's! They have a great selection and when you walk in the whole store just smells wonderful, it is the smell of years of roasted coffee permeating the old wood. The worst thing about Anderson's is the small parking lot, but you can usually find something. Since moving away from Texas whenever I visit Austin I make sure to swing by and get a few pounds of coffee to take home, a little taste of home. They also have a wide selection of teas and various brewing paraphernalia (cups, travel mugs, brewing systems, etc.). ", pos

I looooooove coffee and on those slow days, a walk to get a cup of joe is exactly what I need. So I decided to go give their coffee a shot since I was almost out of my home stash and needed an afternoon pick me up. The shop is adorable with a large selection of coffee to buy by the pound and some available to buy a cup. I bought both and they were both awesome. Couple days later I came in for another cup and didn't have a dollar (yeah, for once, a cup of coffee at an appropriate price) so they let me have the coffee and I promised to pay next time.

And the customers. It's always kind of quiet when I'm in line. Sort of a ""respect the coffee"" atmosphere. And where else can you go where they know how to grind beans for an AeroPress, no questions asked? In sum, Anderson's is on the top of my list when I'm asked ""what do you like about Austin?""

The employees are friendly and will take the time to answer your coffee questions. They usually have one drip coffee of the day for purchase and about 8-10 variety of beans to choose from. You can purchase the beans in 1/2lb. increments. They also have a variety of teas, biscuits and chocolates to choose from. I'm totally addicted to the salty  caramel chocolate balls.  Anderson's also has the best selection of manual and automatic coffee makers in the area, including French presses, drip funnels, and everything in between. My current coffee obsession is a light roast washed Ethiopian brewed using a Chemex and Anderson's has these filters!  Anderson's is a good roaster for you if you prefer darker roasts.

They have great gifts for coffee and tea drinkers, amazing little sets and mugs and you can even sample their daily brews which they always have a few out. Parking is not the best, it's next to a few restaurants and it's mostly sidewalk/parallel parking but worth the wait and visit. Will be back. ", pos

It is privately owned. They roast their beans on premise. The House Blend is always a grand choice--but my new favorite is Organic Flores. Truly an excellent cup of coffee.  BTW, if you want to pop in for a cup of coffee, you serve yourself--and it is $1.00. Yes one dollar!  They are also are wonderful in recommending different appliances for coffee brewing at home & are able to give you all the pros and cons.

You can pick up a wide array of coffee makers, from chemex to french press to drip coffee makers. It's a very charming shop, with wafts of coffee aromas drifting out of the front doors.

Anderson’s Coffee Company ," 2/22/2016 We used to live in PDX, (Portland OR!) and now in ATX, very different places, actually. But a common thread, along with the obsessive love of clubs, pubs, and music is the coffee.  The best coffee available in PDX is Stumptown Coffee, also an old name for Portland.  When we were there Stumptown could only be found in a little hole-in-the-wall coffee mill on Division Street. People would line up out the door to get a bag of fresh roasted java.  Austin's equivalent, far as we are concerned, is Anderson Coffee on W. 38th.  Yep, Mozart's is darn good, but hasn't the variety and range of Anderson's fresh milled and roasted beans.  The quality is top-flight, with numerous varieties represented from most continents that grow coffee, particularly shade-grown Central and South American.  Price ranges between 11.99/lb and $14.99 for top premium.  The small shop, with its old, rough wood-grained floors, stained dark (coffee stains?) is not a place to hang out and dawdle over a mug, but to pick out confections of chocolate, imported candies and other treats, and nice little gifts for special occasions.  And to sample some great coffee and take a pound or two home! My only wish is that Anderson's, or somebody nearby, would open a hot chocolate bar to complement the fresh roasted aroma eminating from the roastery! ", pos 
Anderson’s Coffee Company ," 3/23/2014 I remember shopping at Anderson's for fresh coffee from all over the world in the late 1970s when I first came to study at The University of Texas at Austin. Since returning to Austin in late summer, 2013 I have enjoyed Anderson's yet again. The quality and variety of the coffee is amazing (and inspiring!). This company is perhaps one of the earliest to take coffee truly seriously. Other treats in the shop are English and Scottish biscuits and similar treats, specialty candies, mugs, and a wide range of delicious teas. NOTE: if you don't live in Austin you can still have goods from Anderson's shipped - contact the store (I've done this for birthday and other presents in years past). ", pos 
Anderson’s Coffee Company ," 6/12/2014 This is a gem of a place.  The coffee beans are prime.  They aren't like the nasty stale Central Market coffee beans that just sit in those bulk dispensers for who knows how long.    When you walk into the store, it's like entering what I would imagine would be coffee heaven.  The aromas just wafting into your nostrils are so tantalizing.  Yes, I'm breaking out the big words for this review.  They have all sorts of coffee beans and tea leaves, plus an assortment of candy and chocolate.  Personally, I like the caramel sea salt chocolates they sell in small bags at the counter.    I usually order a pound of house blend, which you can't go wrong with, plus a pound of their special coffee bean of my choosing.  I like to ask the bean aficionados about the different coffee beans just to listen to them talk passionately about their beans and the different notes of flavor they have.  It's really impressive to me how much they know their coffees and are quite serious about them.  They are always so friendly and helpful, even when they are busy busy on Saturdays.  I usually go early Saturdays to miss the crowd and the crazy parking.  All in all, I can't say enough good things about this little hole-in-the-wall coffee place.

It took me a while to find it, but will never leave now that I'm here. Honestly, I bring my own coffee everywhere I go now. Only 2 restaurants in Austin serve coffee good enough for my taste, so I bring my Anderson's roasts with me everywhere.  I personally stick to decafs, and have tried 3 different varieties. The French roast is a staple favorite. The Sumoan was really good as well. The House blend I didn't find as dark roasted as I like my coffee.  But honestly, other than personal preference, there isn't a single coffee not worth it's weight. The parking lot can get hectic at times, but I can always find a space on the street or in the lot eventually.  The people here are fantastic. Very laid back and helpful. Just try one of the two coffees they have brewed on the counter, or ask about one on the board. Specify how much, and what type of filter you use. And if you need it ground or not. Takes no more than 10 min, even when it's busy.   Oh and I hate sharing which treats are my favorite, but I promise you can't go wrong for a snack or gift for a chocolate and coffee lover.

Years ago, I remember getting a cup of coffee at Anderson's but it did not impress me for some odd reason. I guess that was before I had grown up taste buds. Today, I stopped in to find Hubby a ""unique"" coffee scoop for his stocking since he is the brew master at our house.  After a thorough search for weeks, I found it here. On my way to pay for the only unique coffee scoop in the city of Austin, I sampled their coffee of the day.  It was a rich and mellow Mocha Java.  Wow.  Where is the bitterness?  Like I taste at Starbucks, God love 'em.  (And apparently She does since billions of people buy their coffee and goodies every day.)    Anderson's is a fantasyland for the coffee and tea lover.  My head spun around the neat and colorful shop taking in the mugs, cups, boxes of wonderful teas, fresh roasted coffees, packages and tins of cookies and candy, t-shirts, and coffee and tea accessories.  Simply put, it's a head shop for the caffeine addict. ", pos

It's a place where you go to buy coffee by the pound or the half pound. They sell coffee by the cup, for a quite reasonable price of a dollar a cup! Score! I got the Guatemalan roast, which is earthy and crisp. The store has all kinds of accessories for your coffee and tea drinking needs- things like wild French presses, tea pots, chocolates to serve with your tea, finger foods, you name it. The coffee selection is out of this world! They must have had 20 different blends of coffees from lands that I've only heard of. They break down their menu by geographic region, which is pretty cool! The prices are quite reasonable, considering the quality of the beans and the roast. The store is clean, and the staff is quite friendly and helpful! Parking was a breeze, as they have their own private lot, and there's a restaurant next door where they proudly serve Anderson's coffee, so if you wanna lounge around and sip your joe, you can do it next door.

I was in a warm and fuzzy meeting recently and the facilitator was going around the room prompting us for concerns. After several despondent financial and relationship stories it came to me, and my only issue and truthful response was I needed to get to Anderson's because I was low on coffee. Since I don't spend more than I make and actively work on my relationships, I just don't have a lot of angst to share.  Anderson's is one of those places that make Austin Austin. Staff seem to come and go, but their quality of beans, blends, and roasts have been consistent for me and their prices are remarkably modest.  I'm not a connoisseur, I can't discourse on the legacy of Peet, but I can brew some freshly ground Alfred's Blend that's just superb. I always keep their premium low-caffeine blend on hand.  Incidentally, I have nothing against caps and latts at Starbucks, I just get my personal unfettered coffee at Anderson's. In my office building's community kitchen, where there are always pots of normal coffee, I'll brew some Anderson blends occasionally just to see the quizzical RCA dog-like expressions from the unsuspecting Folgerites.

Anderson’s Coffee Company ," 4/8/2010 Listed in Yelp=Therapy Let me be upfront about something: I don't drink coffee.    But I have a very close relationship with two of the world's biggest coffee snobs.  These normally laid back, down-to-earth folks noses go straight into the air in regards to coffee.  They have been known to shriek things such as, ""No, no you can't do that!!!!  You will bruise the beans!!!""  Or ""Ooooh noooo, we don't DO flavored coffee,"" with a look of disdain.  They cringe at the thought of buying pre-ground beans and they lament the fact that their car's cup holders don't accommodate the carafe (yes carafe) of freshly brewed coffee that travels with them everywhere they go.  Pretentious much?  I'd say so.    Something else they are adamant about is buying their coffee from Anderson's.  As a kid, weekend activities such as softball games, birthday parties, and Girl Scout campouts were scheduled around trips to Anderson's (they are closed on Sundays so we had to make it on a Saturday, even if it was a very busy Saturday).  You would think growing up in this environment, some coffee knowledge would have seeped through to me, but nope, I don't even know how to brew a cup.  In fact, I'm quite intimidated by coffee and shy away from coffee shops.  I get nervous trying to order, afraid that I'll make some mistake.    One day I realized I needed to buy some coffee because I had house guests coming.  I went straight to Anderson's, and though I had some anxiety about ordering the wrong thing, the staff was friendly and knowledgeable and best of all, not the least bit pretentious (ahem, mom & dad!).  Walking in the door, it smells absolutely divine and there are all sorts of little knick-knacks.    Quite simply, the best coffee in Austin.

The somewhat rustic ambiance and the smell of coffee always delighted me.  But the best thing was the delightful freshly roasted coffees.    I moved from Austin (we all make mistakes) and coffee just wasn't the same any more.  A year ago, I returned for a visit.  Walking into Anderson's was a pure delight!  I suddenly realized that the reason I hadn't enjoyed coffee in years was because I hadn't had Anderson's coffee in years.  Now when I visit Austin, there are two experiences I seek out - dinner at La Fonda San Miguel, and shopping at Anderson's.  Together, they let me know that I'm REALLY back in Austin.  Since that visit, I've been ordering from them on-line.  This week, I ordered on Monday, and my order was delivered to me in Dallas on Tuesday - and that wasn't with overnight delivery!

I don't know if it is the quality of beans or Anderson's roasting process, but the coffee I brew with these beans is the most full flavored coffee I've ever had.  They consistently produce a product worth buying.  I recommend branching out to try many of their beans, b/c they always deliver an excellent cup.  The other huge plus: their coffee is reasonably priced.  I like to try local roasters when I travel.  I've seen beans up to $16 per pound.  Around Austin, the going rate seems to be $12 a pound.  But at Anderson's, you'll find most beans for a couple of dollars cheaper, although they have started carrying a featured bean that is usually $12 per pound.  I make it a point NOT to buy the feature because one of the things I value so much about Anderson's is their lower price for a higher quality product.  The staff are also very helpful and friendly.  I was recently considering giving a gift of a ChemEx.  I got a thorough explanation of how it produces a better cup of coffee and all my questions were answered patiently.

I started buying coffee from them several years ago and have been impressed by the consistency and quality of their product.  It is a place where you want to go when you are buying fresh beans.  Do not judge them by the brewed coffee they have in the store.  It is often too strong and not well brewed.  It doesn't do justice to the quality of their beans.    Over the years I have pointed coffee loving friends to this store and everyone who has tried it loves their coffee.  Once when we were out of coffee and didn't want to make the drive to Anderson's (about 15-20 minutes from my house) we picked up some of the higher quality coffee from HEB that was about the same price as what we bought at Anderson's.  We brought it home and brewed it up.  I couldn't believe how bad it was in comparison to what we were used to drinking.  We poured it out, threw it in the trash and made a trip.  Stop by, support a local Austin business and enjoy some great coffee.  Note that they will also ship to customers out of town.  Here is a bonus:  Try brewing your coffee in an Aeropress.  You can pick one up at Anderson's or on-line at Amazon.  It is the best way we have found to make their great coffee taste even better. ", pos

I really don't care, though, since this place has the best value in to-go coffee that I've seen in the city.  A 12 oz cup of Starbucks costs $1.50, I believe; Whole Foods and Central Market costs closer to $2.  At Anderson's, a to-go cup of coffee costs $1 even, and it's better than most of the coffee at the above-mentioned places.  Supposedly, their in-house roasted coffee is an even better value, but I have yet to buy it because my piece-of-crap coffeemaker couldn't really do it justice.  Someday...  The quaint but attractive shop is located near the original Kerbey Lane, which sometimes makes it challenging to find parking.  But I promise the effort is worth it.

Anderson’s Coffee Company ," 3/9/2010 My very first coffee came from Anderson's in 1978 and I've never looked back! They were ""doing"" coffee before coffee was cool...or, should it be, before coffee was hot?  Jamie Anderson learned his roasting skills from the paterfamilias of the American coffee  movement, that is, Alfred Peet, way back in the early '70s. For those who don't know, Mr. Peet taught lots of people the roasting art, and a few of his disciples migrated to Seattle after some time in Berkeley, to sell Peet's coffee in that town under the name Starbucks.  Anderson's doesn't dive too deeply into the wacky world of single origin/estate beans, sticking to a proven variety of classic classics, and they just do those better than just about anyone...with 40 years experience in this deep, rich cup, they were doing it before most of today's coffee hot rods were even born. The best part is, well, the second best part after the quality, is the price...shop around. I live in Portland where the ultra hip Stumptown runs 12-20 per pound...and up. And it's never, ever as good as Anderson's where the top coffees go for maybe 8.95 or 9.95 max. I think you can still get some varieties for 7.95! Stumptown, y'all need to go back to school, take a big slice of humble pie, and start over!  Austin, if you like great coffee, get to Anderson's. It's just that simple.

Anderson’s Coffee Company ," 4/12/2012 I do not like to think of myself as a SNOB.  Or maybe I do?  I have been asking myself that lately?  All I know is that I am very careful about trying things I love.  Because once I tasted the ""Premo"", I have a REAL hard time settling for anything less.  For example, a few years ago I went in to Andersons, bought an AEROPRESS (Awesome!) and a pound of beans.    Went home and experimented with my new coffee pump and I had cup after cup of the best coffee of my life.  I called my wife, tweaking out on caffeine, ""OH MY GOODNESS THIS COFFEE IS SO FREAKING GOOD!!!   AHHHWWW I CAN NOT BELIEVE HOW GOOD THIS COFFEE IS  BAWWWAAAHHH!!!""  Now 3 years have passed by and I have this to say.  The Aeropress is mind blowing.  I always order an Americano when I am buying a cup of coffee from a local establishment, and I have had maybe three cups that are in the same dimension as what I can get out of that AEROPRESS.  Absolutely amazing!    While I used to think that it was the AEROPRESS that made any coffee amazing, I have learned that the AEROPRESS can only bring coffee to its full potential.  I have tried coffee beans from many places and NO BODY has coffee like Andersons.  It is so good that I will be at the grocery store, standing in front of the Coffee, completely out at home and my eyes will be swelling up with tears  looking at the sorry ass beans.  Looking and looking at all of the sorry bags of coffee. I used to really like some of the more expensive bags, but they all fall way short of Andersons.    So I tell myself ""SELF, if you buy coffee here, you wont make a point to stop by andersons, and every time you make a cup with theses crappy beans you will disappointed.  Go with out, and get to Andersons ASAP.""  So that is what I do.  I love Andersons coffee so much that I will go without coffee for several days until I can get the good stuff.  I love coffee, but now that I can have the best, that is what I want.  The best or bust.  If there is better coffee out there, I will try it.  Trust me I am looking!  But as of the last three years Andersons is the winner.  Java Panture and Italian Expresso is what i get the most often, but it is all good.  Also, the decaf is so good!  I used to think of decaf coffee as dirty brown water, or a pointless waste of time, but this Decaf is a delicious treat.  Okay so I am a snob about what I am passionate about. ", pos

I'm rather partial to the Red Sea Blend and Alfred's Blend.  The price is right, too, if you're used to buying bulk beans and not Folger's or Sanka. His coffee runs $9-$11 a pound. That's by and by cheaper than most of Central Market's stuff just down the road.  I've never had the customer service problems that have been described by others on this board. I can believe that they occasionally exist as it's a small business and not all small businesses subscribe to a doormat customer service policy.  But I usually have Mr. Anderson in his apron and bowtie serving me. Or some cute young guy serving up my beans. It's not unusual, even on a busy Saturday morning, for me to be asked three or four times if I've been helped while I'm in the middle of getting my order filled already.

Take your florists, salons, or restaurants... it's even better than tanning skin at Barton Creek... fine olfactory experiences all... take every one of them, and well you'd have a major stink if you put them all together. SINGULARLY, though, Anderson Coffee is The Incredible Austin Smell. Give me a candle, a spray, something. I want to be wrapped in the scent. (And now that the nose part of myself has expressed itself, perhaps inappropriately...)  Here goes: - Really top-notch, so-fresh-it-bubbles, roasted coffee. - I am addicted to the Fancy Jasmine green tea they carry. - Their collection of chocolates is hard to beat. - Head on over if you're looking for cool tea pots and coffee accessories.  One of the reviewers mentioned they're not the nicest staff. Customer service is a big deal, but I've never had them be rude to me. Are they sunshiney-give-me-a-big-hug? No. But I don't get the ""hipper-than-thou"" attitude too many of this town's establishments dish out. (That's right, Thundercloud. I'm looking at you.) These people know their stuff. They what they do well. I can't fault them.  I've been going to Anderson's for years. They've never let me down. They were doing the roasted beans thing way before the mermaid moved in. It is the sort of business that makes this city great.  If you like coffee, you owe it to yourself to pick up some of theirs and take it home with you. You won't be sorry. ", pos 
Anderson’s Coffee Company , 11/1/2009 1 check-in I've been going to Anderson's since I was a toddler with my mom.  It is one of my absolute favorite places in Austin. The rich coffee smell is AWESOME.  I don't buy my coffee anywhere else. The Dark Sumatra is the best.  I recently discovered you can call in your order and then pick it up - saves me 10 minutes.  I've never found a reason to complain about the staff - they've always been incredibly nice people.  I really cannot say enough good things about Anderson's Coffee. , pos

The prices are great, and the selection of coffees & teas (my wife & I drink both) are fantastic. The staff are knowledgable and passionate about their excellent product, as well as attentive and good humored; we joked & laughed the entire time we were in there. Add to that the wide collection of brewing accessories, jams, jellies, biscuits, and candies... and Anderson's is now on my monthly shopping calendar. We walked out of there with some candies I haven't seen since my childhood, a pound of organic Sumatran coffee (which is excellent, by the way) and some English shortbread biscuits my parents used to serve for high tea.

Anderson’s Coffee Company ," 1/30/2009 Great place that has been an Austin tradition for years.  The place that taught me that all coffee was not Folgers.  Yes, one or two of the staff have been crabby a time or two, but they have been generally knowledgeable and friendly over the 20-odd years I've been going there.  Actually, sorry, I must comment further on this issue.  Folks, this is what you get sometimes when you deal with small businesses staffed by real people who are not trained into absolute subservience.  If you don't like the way you are treated and it bothers you sooooo much, then tell the management.  Mr. Anderson has been there almost every time I've been, he's your guy.  Or, just ignore it.  The Kenya AA is my favorite, Arabian Mocha is also darn tasty.  I've mucked around with a few of their loose leaf teas, no complaints.

He helped me pick a few coffees based upon what I had liked before.  I even had my three year old son with me and if you have never been here before this place is a regular china shop filled with hundreds of tea and coffee mugs and sets.  Even though I brought the equivalent of a bull into their china shop, they were very friendly.  I will definitely be back again!

Anderson’s Coffee Company ," 11/26/2008 I just recently started brewing my own coffee during the last few months.  I never really made my own coffee in the past but making coffee has become a part of my morning ritual.  After reading the positive yelp reviews, I decided to try the coffee from here.  My first visit here was very pleasant and I was pleased to see that they had so many different types of coffee to choose from.  I got the mocha java blend and it was divine-very smooth and tasty.    My second visit to this place was about a month ago and it was a completely different experience.  The woman who 'helped' me was so rude and completely disengaged.  She didn't seem like she wanted to bother with helping me or answer any questions.  I wanted to get some recommendations and asked her about how a couple of the different coffees tasted.  She wasn't forthcoming and just didn't really care to share her thoughts or provide any useful input on the 2 or 3 coffees I was asking about.  She also didn't seem to appreciate my patronage either.  Just that experience alone makes me not want to go back here, even though there were a few other coffees I wanted to try. ", neutral 
Anderson’s Coffee Company ," 8/24/2008 I really love Anderson's! Their coffee is fantastic & I love shopping there. The past 2 years i was out of Austin and tried out a wide range of good coffees-Portland's Stumptown, Chicago's Intelligentsia, and NC's Counterculture. All are good well-regarded brews. In fact, i truly wondered, after some time without it,  how Anderson's would measure up. Fortunately, the answer is that Anderson's continues to meet and exceed my expectations, with great taste and quality. yum!  Anderson's coffee has several roasts rated highly as a ""cup of excellence"". Moreover, compared to the other coffees out there, Anderson's is  far more economical. Counterculture, Stumptown and Intelligentsia all sell 12oz bags of beans for over $12 whereas at Anderson's, a full 16oz is still less than $10. For a couple who goes through a large amount of coffee each month, this is important, and appreciated.  Anderson's sells many Fair Trade and Organic coffees.  A few years ago, Anderson's started offering coffee by the cup. When i was there today, i was happy to see they still offer it. A real treat, the coffee costs just $1 and is delicious, putting Pike's place to shame!  My favorite is the Red Sea Blend, but i really love trying all the different types. Recently, i've been enjoying the Nicaraguan. The staff at Anderson's is friendly, the store is inviting and intriguing. You can buy coffee filters, cool mugs, tshirts, grinders, specialty candies, and all types of coffee makers and paraphernalia.  oh yeah, Anderson's stocks a nice variety of teas and tea paraphernalia  mmm, coffee!  ps: the Holiday Blend is da bomb!  pps: i've now tried the decaf, and the 40/60 blend. Also good, and i can't tell it's decaf ", pos

Anderson’s Coffee Company ," 7/12/2011 I've been a coffee drinker since I was 15. Before that I would occasionally have a small cup from the pot my mom brewed with Anderson's coffee beans (loaded with sugar of course). I can't remember drinking any other coffee in my life. I'm 22 years old now and have always started my day with Anderson's coffee. I've been to coffee shops all around town and there is no substitute. My favorite's the colombian, so I always get a pound of that plus another pound of a random roast I feel like trying.

Well, I've moved on since then and now that I work right by this place, this is where I go to get my caffeine.    It's $1 for a cup of good tasting coffee.  The first time that I went in there, it was explained to me that the drinks that they sell there are coffee and decaf.  That's it.  There's one size.  If you want a creamer, they have half and half.

Caffé Medici serves espresso from Spyhouse Coffee Roasters (from Minneapolis) and their house coffee is Wild Gift Coffee, a local coffee roaster in Austin. They do French pressed coffee, cafe au lait, iced coffee, toddy, and the usual espresso drinks. In addition, they also serve iced tea, hot tea, and hot chocolate. And if that wasn't enough, they have beer on tap.  I love the interior. It's lofty and there's lots of seating. My favorite has to be the coffee bar, where the baristas work their magic while you sit around the bar and relax. I love all the wood everywhere, from the floors to the walls to the tables and chairs. It's gives off a very warm and cozy atmosphere.  I ordered a latte and a walnut scone. Both were really good and the perfect pick-me-up for a long work day. If you're in downtown Austin and need some a good cup of Joe, stop by Caffé Medici. ", pos 
Caffé Medici ," 9/6/2016 Definitely was not expecting to like this spot as much as I did and I'm glad my fellow Texas CM pal, Luci ,recommended this spot to me!  Situated in the heart of downtown, you can find plenty of cheap parking nearby so you won't have to dread walking a few blocks to get here. In all seriousness... walking in ATX is never a bad thing and I love the views of downtown.  This double decker coffee house not only has seating downstairs but a few community and small tables upstairs. The drinks were good and was very happy about the availability of Hibiscus Iced Tea and their coffee variations.  The ordering of your coffee at this spot is a little different than most but it's very easy to catch on for us newbies that visit.  You'll want to walk towards the very back, past the first coffee bar you see. Once you order your drinks, your name will be called at the front coffee bar and then voila! A drink with your name on it (not literally, it's not starbucks) will be ready for you.  If you need wifi they have it and yes it's free.  Drinks were very reasonable and the environment was superrrr chill. I honestly was impressed with their music and got caught away when they started playing 80s music. Points for playing Eurythmics btw.  Austin's coffee scene has always been superb and I'm glad to have another spot on my rotation.

We stopped by Caffe Medici for some much needed caffeine and to while away a half hour or so before heading to see the famous bats.  I liked the space and the iced coffee I ordered was delicious. The wait can be a bit long since they clearly try to perfect your order and perfection sometimes should not be rushed. If you were in a hurry, this could be very frustrating. However, as mentioned, we were trying to kill as much time as possible. Therefore, the friendly barista's pace was not something that made us impatient.  We sat upstairs and tried to watch the traffic on Congress. It was not overly interesting, but this afforded us an opportunity to relax and not rush (which was what we mostly did during our Austin visit).  Caffe Medici gave us a chance to slow down, reenergize with amazing coffee and that was much appreciated. Until next time! Looking down Congress ", pos

We just got a standard French Press Coffee (Large, $3.10, yelp.com/user_local_phot…) which was good, but not the best coffee I've ever had. I think I would have had a better experience if we ordered an espresso based drink and/or breakfast taco, and/or were hanging out here since it's quite spacious inside and very modern.

We stumbled upon Medici while exploring the downtown area and, being in need of a caffeine fix, decided to stop in. The space itself is great. I loved the open feel and adequate seating space. There are few things worse than a good coffee shop that doesn't have anywhere to sit! The setup was a little unique, with orders being taken at one counter towards the back, while drinks are prepared at a larger central bar. I actually think this is a good idea as it probably reduces congestion during peak times as people wait for their drinks.  I was craving iced coffee so I kept it pretty simple. I was not at all disappointed. I usually drink hot coffee black, but iced coffee with cream and sugar due to its inherent bitterness. This iced coffee was barely bitter at all, and did not require much of anything to be added. Because of this I am assuming it is cold-brewed, which makes a huge difference.  My friend ordered a mocha, which I tasted and also found to be delicious. It was made to be just barely sweet, which is perfect.  On top of the great coffee, the service was also quick and everyone we encountered was friendly. ", pos

I ordered a cappuccino, and I was impressed with the velvety milk and delicious espresso. Not bitter at all! Not to mention, the barista made some beautiful latte art. I didn't get a chance to try any of the snacks, pastries, or breakfast tacos, but it all looked great! Definitely a good spot for coffee and a quick snack or breakfast.  The location of this cafe was very accessible and a great spot in downtown. Unfortunately, you have to rely on street parking to get there. A view from the upstairs lounge area. A lovely cappuccino!

Caffé Medici ," 9/5/2015 This is definitely my go-to spot whenever I'm downtown and looking for a nice coffee venue to do my work. They commonly host musicians to play while you're enjoying coffee and taking in the downtown views.  Their coffee is great although it doesn't stand out as much when compared to other coffee shops in Austin ( Summermoon anyone? ) but I truly enjoy the atmosphere they provide. There is additional seating upstairs and for the most part, it's never too crowded when you go there which is also another reason why I like this spot.  Definitely would recommend this spot. ", pos

I didn't have my wallet with me as I was planning on simply going to and from working out. She said she got me except for when it was time to pay, her card only allowed for payment of half of the total! She was having ""bank issues"" so could not transfer any money either. Santiago turned a slightly embarrassing moment into an act of kindness by telling her not to worry about the rest. He did not act annoyed nor cancel the order & even went to the back to grab us some stickers we asked for with the order. Way to go on the customer service front!

Caffé Medici ," 4/28/2016 1 check-in Been visiting Austin for the week, this has been the best espresso I've found. The barista wasn't measuring out grams like other shops do, he wasn't using an automated tamper, nothing fancy, just experienced hand at the machine. The shot was served quickly, with a side of cookie and sparkling water. The shot started out with a subtle crisp sweetness, the lovely bittersweet mark of a great blend of beans. The crema was present but not overwhelming. Good temperature. ", pos

Caffé Medici ," 3/21/2015 1 check-in I'm not a coffee connoisseur by any means - I don't think I could tell you the difference between an espresso from Medici and one from the Starbucks across the street.  What I am familiar with in coffee shops is atmosphere. People look for different things in coffee shops. What I look for is a warm and cozy atmosphere, with interesting conversation and people - like your grandparents' house but more public.  This Caffe Medici is very clean and spacious, with beautiful lighting and an impressive espresso bar and selection of pastries. It is also cold and devoid of feeling. Fitting, I suppose, for a location in downtown Austin, but it is also unsettling.  The service was the warmest part of the establishment. My chai was served quickly and with a smile.  If you like pretty aesthetics that are safe and spotless, this Caffe Medici is for you. If you are looking for a more authentic, Austin-like provocative feeling, I would try the Medici close to the University of Texas campus (on Guadalupe). As empty as my soul after sitting here View from the top open floor. ", neutral 
Caffé Medici ," 10/27/2015 Nice place - good music, comfy couches for lounging plus some sturdy spaces for working and meeting... nice little patio, too.  I love the cortado... one of my favorite coffee drinks but hard to find.  (Starbucks says it's the same as the espresso macchiato, but definitely not.)  Knowledgeable and friendly staff... Maybe I just wish they had a bit more seating, and I think that the layout of the place can get a little weird (have to walk to the back in order to place an order).

I tried the espresso and planned to work there. However, there is no elevator to go to the second floor, and I can not use the stair in my wheelchair...so it remains unexplored to me.

Caffé Medici ," 7/7/2014 1 check-in I feel like Texas is an espresso state. Single origin drip coffee doesn't seem to have made its way here yet. I was in town and wanted coffee, and Caffe Medici just called out to me when I looked on yelp, even if it was a bit out of the way.  So we took our chances.  As soon as I saw cyclists hanging out on the patio outside with their nice bikes on a Sunday morning, I had high hopes for this place. The drip coffee (pourover via clever brew) was very nice, though I'm not sure if it's the bean itself or the brew that made a cup that soured unpleasantly as it cooled.  The ambiance and decor in here is amazing. Upstairs has tables and ample floor outlets (so jealous!) and downstairs an espresso bar - an actual bar that serves espresso, and giant windows for natural lighting.  We remarked that our grades in college would've been so much better if we had a space like this to get work done. It's everything I look for in a work environment, except that the tables upstairs are a bit small. ", pos

Caffé Medici ," 2/9/2015 7 check-ins Listed in Coffee Shops in Austin As a student, I prefer this Medici to the one next to campus. This place is much better lit, has enough outlets for everyone upstairs, and most importantly this place isn't crowded during work hours (around 9am-5pm).  Every time I come here (about twice a week), I am able to find a table and an outlet to get a few hours of work done. That's more than I can say about the other Medici!  The coffee, like all Medicis, can be better, but that's the cost of a great working area. The noise level is also pretty high here because of all the meetings taking place and the open layout so I recommend bringing headphones. ", pos 
Caffé Medici ," 9/25/2014 1 check-in I think I would live here if I could.  For a coffee shop, it's got it all - great espresso, friendly baristas, and amazing space. The only reason I don't give it a 5 is because it is so downtown it can be hard to find a parking space.  Anyway, out of all the coffee places I've been to in Austin, Caffe Medici is in the top 5. They grind a special Cuvee blend which they have dialed in to perfection and will graciously make into a fabulous espresso drink of your choosing. It is also one of the few places I will go for a cortado because their making of it is impeccable.  Caffe Medici changed my mind about espresso, because it was one of the first places I went to that made it taste good. ", pos

Caffé Medici ," 3/27/2013 1 check-in Listed in 2013 Yelp 100 Challenge, The best part of waking up is Cuvée in your cup! Caffé Medici, you're pretty cute.  I really like their hot chocolate. It's everything hot chocolate should be. It's rich without being overpowering and it's smooth. The raspberry Italian soda is also pretty tasty - it's light and refreshing and I imagine it would be quite good on a hot summer's day. I don't drink coffee, so I can't comment on their coffee drinks.  The atmosphere is very open. I feel like I can have a quiet conversation here and no one will care, but I can also come here to get work done, if necessary. The upstairs seems to be a quieter spot to allow for more focused working while the downstairs lounge and bar offers a better setting for conversation.  You order at the counter in the back and pick up your drinks at the bar in the center. They also have a rewards card - for every ten drinks you buy, you get one free. I don't have a rewards card, but my friend does and he makes great use of it.  Now that I'm no longer a student, I have little reason to visit coffee shops except for meeting friends. My friend really enjoys coming here since he is still a student, and sometimes I get to tag along. (Gotta get out of the house sometime, you know?)  Parking can be tricky since it's downtown, so I recommend walking, taking the bus, or riding your bike. Parking isn't impossible, but depending on what's going on downtown on any given night, it can be a pain. (I don't mind since I enjoy walking downtown, but I know that's not for everyone.)  I'm not a coffee shop connoisseur, but this place is welcoming, the drinks are good, and the service is excellent. Hot chocolate ", pos

Caffé Medici ," 12/7/2013 2 check-ins Listed in ATX Coffee Fix Caffe Medici has an interesting set up--they have a bar area in the center of the shop with another area to order coffee near the back of the first floor. There is also a second floor with plenty of area to find an area to sit down if the first floor is filled up. I've personally preferred sitting on their couch or sitting at one of the tables near the big glass window on the first floor--it's nice to occasionally ""people watch"" (promise I'm not a creeper!)  The service here is impeccable--I once didn't use a Paypal app correctly here so I could use the discount they were offering.

Not a very busy place in the evening on a weekday.  There is a nice place to sit outside and watch all the tourists and locals stroll, jog and bike by as its situated close to the capital.  House coffee is pretty good, about a medium roast.  Wouldn't mind having a cup every day.  Would be great with a bread type pastry, like a bagel but not a doughnut.

The place was super clean and the internet connection is decent, and there were huge windows that let in the light. True that upstairs seating is very uncomfortable and the music was loud and a little distracting. Likely this is just me, but the safety railing on the second floor seems flimsy; I kept worrying someone was going to drop something over the railing and hit someone on the first floor (not highly probable, I know). Parking is a bummer but what can you do? I won't be back, mostly because it's pricey and I'm not into feeding ravenous meters and walking a mile just to get some work done. ", neutral

The sound system here is incredible and whomever was manning the playlist while I was there did a great job of picking some pretty jazz for my ears. There was a point when I looked around thinking there was a live band playing in a corner of the shop!  Once you walk in, don't go to the coffee bar to order -rather go to the back to a small desk with pastries and a cash registrar to place your order. I've had their mocha, straight up regular coffee, and a shot os espresso. Every drink hit my caffeine heart and had beautiful crema to top.

Caffé Medici ," 4/25/2013 2 check-ins Finding a coffeeshop in which you can actually work is a bit tricky - is it too loud or conversely, is it pin-drop silent? What about seating arrangements? And will the baristas act put out if you overstay your welcome?  I'm happy to report that Caffé Medici turned out to be the perfect space for our needs. It's a popular meeting place for many in the downtown area, so talking while we worked didn't feel disruptive as the scene is already a buzz-y one. I especially liked the high chair seating around the perimeter of the central coffee bar - sometimes, it's just easier to work next to each other instead of sharing a computer screen across a table. There's also an upstairs area if you're seeking a slightly more subdued atmosphere!  Coffee is outstanding - the latte was smooth and robust; just the right temperature. If you're hungry, the menu isn't extensive but they do stock Greek yogurt, buttery croissants and several varieties of tacos.

Caffé Medici ," 4/25/2013 Listed in Coffee Shop Livin' For some reason, I just don't get it. I love coffee - I love the aroma that comes from a fresh cup, the strength and robustness that comes from a great brew, and the beautiful latte art that I feel awful for destroying the second I take my first sip. But Caffe Medici just doesn't do it for me.  Don't get me wrong, I love the location itself - very convenient in downtown, really sleek and modern furniture, a great study space upstairs that is very conducive to getting work done (yay for outlets!), a downstairs and patio area that are great for catching up with friends, and cool events that take place downstairs every so often (the last time I went there was a free salsa class downstairs!). It's so cute that I just want to love it so badly. But the actual coffee itself leaves me wanting so much more.  I usually stick to getting a cappuccino, however I've also had their black coffee, cafe au lait, and their latte. From my experiences, the coffee drinks just don't have the smoothness that I find at other coffee shops (ahem, Patika right around the corner), and their cappuccino lacks one of my favorite parts - the foam. I'm not sure if the milk is frothed at the incorrect temperature, but it just wasn't right. The black coffee was good, but didn't find anything special about it or its flavor and same with the cafe au lait.  The drinks are also pretty pricey and are priced similar to coffee shops that carry the highest quality coffee such as Intelligentsia and Stumptown. I'm sorry, but I'm not willing to pay $4 for a mediocre cappuccino. I know the Medici family controlled the banking institutions in Italy, but a mediocre coffee shop is not going to rob this gal.

Granted, I always order my customary latte, so this review, in all honesty, will only concern that drink and CM ambiance, but the two are consistently amazing.

Caffé Medici ," 1/17/2014 First things first: The coffee is great. At least their espresso based drinks are. The reviews that say they don't like the coffee, are entitled to their opinion, and it is relative I suppose. But these people know their coffee and their espresso is true to Italian tradition. So why am I giving it 3 stars? Their pastries are sooooo bad in comparison with their coffee. It's mind boggling that there would be such a mismatch in quality between the pastries and the coffee. They have like 2 day old croissants wrapped in plastic wrap inside a dimly lighted display case and some cookies that look like they got at Costco.

I highly recommend the New Orleans Iced -- it's really strong and really really good. They don't allow outside food, so you have to settle for their packaged snacks and a small display case of prepare food from other vendors. ", pos 
Flightpath Coffeehouse ," 11/7/2016 1 check-in Good place to study, however it can be really full on weekends. Their tomato soup was really good and filling and it was only 3 dollars! Tomato soups can tend to be salty for me depending on the restaurants but the one here was very savory and the soup and tea helped my throat since I had strep throat. Weird yellow lighting for pictures, but quiet atmosphere and can get a lot fo stuff done. Not a necessarily cute coffeeshop bu perfect for when you need to concentrate Tomato soup and raspberry hot tea ", pos 
Flightpath Coffeehouse ," 8/21/2016 1 check-in Listed in So you're going to Austin.. I completely got my coffee-snob on here. Flightpath's coffee is amazing. We stopped in on a blazing hot summer day and before I could wipe the sweat off my brow the barista prepared our iced drinks. Wow, that was fast. Press that ice to your forehead and chill out, man. My iced mocha was sooooo good! It was just the right blend of coffee and chocolate thank you very much. And my coffee-snob-honey's drink was also really good. It tasted all the right vanilla and bold and cream. I'm literally craving some more of that delicious bev as I write this.  Anyways, the vibe is not over the top hipster but it's an eclectic alternative feel. Outside, the woodsy wrap around area is expansive. Didn't see that coming. I'm impressed. And now my man needs to go get his carpenter on and build me some.  His cup of joe should get him going on that. See all photos from Paisley B. for Flightpath Coffeehouse ", pos 
Flightpath Coffeehouse ," 8/23/2016 2 check-ins I like Flightpath Coffee. The staff is always extra nice and polite, and they serve amazing quiche. Their iced tea is also pretty good. They have a lot of tables and a patio outside with funky lighting. The music is also conducive to relaxation and/or casual work.  What I don't like about Flightpath is their coffee. This is a bit of a problem since the place is supposed to be a coffee shop. The couple of times I tried their latte, the coffee either tasted scorched (first visit), or very watered down (second visit). This makes it difficult for me to justify coming back too often, especially when there are other amazing coffee shops nearby (*cough* epoch *cough*).  Another downer is that although the locale is fairly large, it's hard to find a spot as students (and professionals who don't want to work from home?) occupy all the seats and tables. I get the first arrived, first served way of doing business, but the place isn't so useful to me if I have to fight for a seat every time I visit.  Flightpath is therefore a cozy spot to study and grab a snack at, if you are lucky enough to find a seat. Personally, I will be careful to avoid their coffee on future visits as I've been disappointed twice already. Large room extending at the back of the coffee shop ", neutral 
Flightpath Coffeehouse ," 9/15/2016 2 check-ins My go to coffee shop for getting some serious work done. They have a wide array of seating (couches, an assortment of chairs, and patio seating outside), and usually there are several empty spots available. To add, all of the spots are well within reach of an outlet or two, which is perfect for my not-so-portable laptop that requires nearly constant charging. When there isn't enough room for me to selfishly take up an entire table with books, laptops, and supplies,  there have always been friendly people that don't mind at all to share a table.  My coffee of choice has been their cafe au lait, which has never ever let me down, and the baristas that serve it to me with full friendliness make the experience even better each time I return. It may seem super random, but one of my favorite things about this place is that they don't have a standard set of coffee mugs. Each time I order, I am surprised by the new mug my order is served in, and I really love scoping out the variety of mugs other customers are sporting whenever I am zoning out from actually doing work.  They have a nice little selection of snacks and great discounts on refills for those who are in for some more serious lengths of time. I highly recommend checking this not-so-little shop out!

Flightpath Coffeehouse ," 2/6/2016 1 check-in Wow, this is probably the most spacious and studying-friendly coffee shop I have found in the Austin area. Not only is there casual seating in the front foyer, but behind the bar there is additional seating along with a large number of outlets for your devices, and beyond that, there is a good amount of outdoor seating - both a bar that overlooks Duval as well as picnic tables and even more outlets.  I think what impresses me most about this place is just how accommodating it is for large numbers of people, along with the fact that it just has so much personality. Outside, there are hanging lights with CD's as the backing, and a painted mural of outerspace. The tables are decorated with small designs and drawings which is super cute.  The interior features a large, body-sized mirror and two bathrooms, and the two 'rooms' of tables are separated by a statement window-wall piece. It gives off a very hipster vibe inside with the colors and low lighting - perfect for getting work done.  Beyond just the general ambience, Flighthouse has parking in the back in addition to the spaces on Duval, and the staff was extremely friendly and immediately made me feel welcomed.  I tried the latte - which is interestingly served in a tall clear glass, despite being a warm drink. I wouldn't say it's my favorite latte ever, but it was really good. Not too rich on the coffee flavor, and a good balance of milk and foam.  I have a lot of good things to say about this place and will definitely return - it may even become a regular spot of mine!

Flightpath Coffeehouse ," 9/27/2016 Amazing menu, their dirty chai is really delicious. The only thing is, and it's really a pro and a con depending on when you get there, is that it's a cafe designed for sit down studying. I've studied there 2-3 times and it's great, but going there you can never be sure about there being a seat available. Also parking is very limited, you have to park quite far away from the cafe and walk there.

Their coffee is relatively cheap compared to other hipster coffeehouses that are becoming popular around austin, which is another great plus especially for college students like myself. I walked in to find tons of tables and chairs for studying and working alone or with friends. And, my favorite part, there were outlets everywhere! Even near the couches in the front of the shop. The baristas are so sweet as well. I am definitely going to make this a regular spot for the rest of the summer and all throughout the coming semesters!

I don't know how to explain it but this coffeehouse is not meant for the tourist trap. Hell to the na- it's a genuine shop located in a true Austin neighborhood and not some Congress Blvd hype or downtown spot attracting everyone and their mothers.  Parking is scarce and most likely you'll need to park in the neighborhoods.  Once you walk in the feel is very warming and you'll find plenty of spots. Honestly I was shocked how huge this coffeeshop is. Almost like a Alice in Wonderland moment. To top it off they even have outdoor seating and a porch.  They have a great drink menu and the staff was on point. I digged how their drinks are based on the amount of espresso shots.

Flightpath Coffeehouse ," 9/8/2016 5 stars = staff 5 stars = atmosphere 4 stars = food/snack selection 3 stars = coffee  The three cafés I frequent the most are Flightpath, Epoch, and Houndstooth. I feel the most warm & fuzzies for Flightpath because they have the absolute friendliest and down-to-earth staff. I genuinely enjoy interacting with the baristas who are always cheerful and welcoming. I often walk here for a quick work break and it always made a pleasant interlude.  I always take my coffee to go but it seems like a good place to study/work.  The crowd that frequents Flightpath always seems engrossed in their stuff so I don't feel like I'm being watched as I come and go (unlike at Houndstooth where it feels very much like a ""see and be seen"" type of place). And they have a mouthwatering assortment of snacks to satisfy any craving you might have.  The one bad thing is that their coffee is not the best. It's definitely not terrible but it's the worst of the three. (Houndstooth has seriously stellar coffee and Epoch is decent but sometimes served with a side of hipster.) I love the lowkey ambiance and lovely baristas though, which I think makes up for it some.  I do like the Carrollton (I think it's called). It's a frozen blended coffee drink. A little icy but refreshing and yummy on a hot day. ", pos

The front area of the coffeehouse is the ""louder"" section and the back is more quiet and focused. There are also plenty of tables outside under a roof. Plugs are available from almost every table and the wi-fi doesn't disappoint!  The only reason I don't rate this coffeehouse 5-stars is because of how poor the parking is.

It's a great place to come if you want to write a term paper, but not if you want to catch up with a friend.  The second rule of Flightpath is the barista does not care one whit about how your day is going. I'm not someone who demands overly cheerful service, but the bare minimum of ""Hi"" or ""What can I get for you?"" would be nice. Instead she just looked at me silently and waited for me to order, and it wasn't the first time.  The coffee is fine, though. ", neutral

Flightpath Coffeehouse ," 9/19/2015 5 check-ins Listed in 2015 Yelp 100 Challenge, The best part of waking up is Cuvée in your cup! As I sit here, sipping my tart cherry melon kombucha and munching on some jalapeño kettle chips, I'm reminded of two of the worst dates I ever went on. Remember La Condesa guy? Yeah, like that guy, but a different type of awful.  A few years ago, I went on my first online date. I wasn't sure how I felt about online dating, but I promised some friends I was going to give it a shot. Luckily for me, the first guy that agreed to meet was only free on the night of my birthday. I explained that my parents were coming into town and I'd be running a marathon that weekend, so I couldn't stay out late or do anything crazy. He suggested Flightpath because it was close to his house and you can never go wrong meeting at a coffee shop.  We met up, get in line to order, and he orders and pays for his drink and then looks at me expectantly. He tells me to order. I am all about equality - I am always willing to pay for my own drink and I split the bill several times in the future on other dates. But this was different - there was no discussion beforehand. He didn't ask if we should split the bill. He just assumed. And on my birthday. If it had been on any other day, fine, but this was my birthday. I paid the $2.50 for my hot chocolate and then he commented on the fact that it was my birthday. The barista then told me she would have given it to me for free if she had known. Oh, well. I appreciated her kindness, but my date's kindness was sorely lacking.  The date was boring and I left after an hour or so to meet my parents. I had an easy out and I was thankful. I didn't have much interest in any further dates, but I figured I wasn't being fair. I hadn't talked with him for very long and I left early - maybe things would have gotten better once he loosened up? Maybe he was nervous?  I am far too nice sometimes.  I agreed to a second date - we met at Flightpath to get coffee and then we were going to get some beer and some food and make a night of it. We order our coffee separately, of course, and then walk to Duval market to get some beer. While he is paying for the beer, something amazing happens. He knocks his coffee over and it spills everywhere. All over the counter, all over him, some on the cashier - it was a coffee fountain that never stopped. I immediately started laughing - how could I not? I laughed so hard I was crying and my date was becoming increasingly more flustered. Now a line was forming and he was trying to hastily soak up the coffee with thin napkins, well aware that he was holding up the line. The more I watched him struggle, the more I laughed. He was now clearly annoyed with my laughter because he was embarrassed, but why couldn't he see how funny this was?  We left and ordered pizza - even though I mentioned I did not like pizza - and headed to pick it up. He made me pay, stating that he purchased the alcohol. Alcohol I wasn't even going to drink. (I drank very rarely those days and he picked a beer I didn't like, so I wasn't really planning on drinking anything.) Now I was annoyed. What the hell kind of date suggests we do all this stuff and then just springs the payment on the other person? He suggested East Side Pies and while I am very glad it led me to discover a type of pizza I'll actually eat, I was beyond irritated that we get there, walk up to the counter, pick up the pizza, and then he tells me, ""You have to pay for it."" Um, what? This wasn't my idea, I told you I didn't like pizza, and you didn't ask me if I would pay for it prior to us ordering! If he had asked, I wouldn't have been so irritated, but if he had asked, I would have suggested that we cook something together so I didn't spend over $20 on something I didn't even want to eat. (And he only spent $8 on the beer that only he was going to drink. Clearly a man who believes in fairness.)  There were no further dates because I was done with that douche.  On the other hand, I am not done with Flightpath. Flightpath has been nothing but sweet to me. They make an amazing hot chocolate and I can't wait to order it once the weather cools down a little more. The people working behind the counter have always been so friendly to me and I love that. I've always found a spot to sit and I love their covered patio. And the outlets - outlets everywhere! Outlets for everyone!  That guy was a total tool, but he did introduce me to Flightpath and East Side Pies, so it wasn't a total waste. ", pos 
Flightpath Coffeehouse ," 12/6/2015 I loved the place. Basically a magnificent place to engorge in studying for exams. One of the most alluring factors is the ability to open up a tab for coffee. That to me seems unheard of, so as I engaged in my readings it was amazing just to order continuous amounts of the decadent chai lattes in a seamless manner. The staff knew how to handle a lot of people and were amazingly friendly. They asked me what I was working on and when I closed my tab as to whether I completed it or not.

I like how affordable their beverages are ($1.75 for a small coffee, compared to over $3 at other places), the variety of snacks and food they have to offer, and the general character inside.  The only downside is parking, since there are only a few spots in the lot and you have to park a block away if you're going to stay, but the atmosphere and affordability is worth the short walk from 50th.  Another plus is having East Side Pies pizza available. It's a little pricey compared to their other offerings, over $3.50 a slice, but also some of my favorite pizza in Austin. ", pos 
Flightpath Coffeehouse ," 5/29/2016 1 check-in Listed in Austin Cafes: Coffee vs Community or Both! I think it's fair to say this one is overrun by students, but that makes for a quiet and concentrated atmosphere that I enjoy feeding off of. I have peace enough to read the Chronicle cover to cover, and sometimes leave a poem in my copy, hoping that some whimsy might loosen up one of these tense folks. The company is really the only con, contrary to what I said above, I know, but no one shows a sense of place here and interactions between strangers are limited, which can aggravate the seating issue (mentioned in other reviews) because most tables can seat up to 4 but are occupied by 1-2. I grabbed a vacant middle seat on the couch once and neither the person on my right nor left said one word. As for the coffee, I can speak to the greatness of the Double Americano/Topo Chico, which I have ordered five times. $4.25 with the cash discount. It's worth mentioning that they have a nice selection of bottled drinks and packaged goods that you can peruse without holding up the line. The baristas are nice always, especially when you have exact change. Another note on service: it is fast. My order is pretty straightforward, but the menu isn't for purists. There's an array of milk and syrup options, so they have to whip up some crazy shit. The people ahead of me today added to their order twice, and also forgot to mention that it was to-go, ugh, but I still waited less than 5 mins. Go team! ", pos 
Flightpath Coffeehouse ," 10/10/2015 I love this neighborhood but I always forget about this place. I came here for the 1st time today to study. It's Saturday during midterms so everyone else did too. I liked it but I didn't love it. Lots of outlets and tables. Dirty chai was great, vanilla latte could have been stronger. Plate my bagel was on was dirty. Service was good-ish. Struggled to find a seat, shared a table with someone, which is fine, I just preferred my own space.  Also, I fully realize this is totally a stupid preference of mine and it really shouldn't matter, but they served me my latte, a hot drink, in a regular drinking glass instead of a mug. I just... look, hot drinks belong in mugs. I couldn't understand why I had a latte in a drinking glass, yall. I saw many people with mugs but I also think I read a review about someone using their own cup, so I don't know if these people brought their own mugs or if they just didn't have anymore or what. It took everything in me not to ask them to pour my drink into a mug. I didn't because I would have felt stupid, but I wanted to. I know it's dumb but it bothered me a little.  I liked the layout and I will return because I can tell that it normally is conducive to studying/working and that it's better when it's less crowded. I will go back during the week and see if I'm right. ", neutral

Flightpath Coffeehouse ," 3/11/2014 26 check-ins Flightpath has quickly become one of my favorite coffee shops to study at. What differentiates this coffee shop from others is the background music. I have realized that the music here is not nearly as loud as it is at other local coffee shops. This makes studying exponentially easier.  The furniture and ambience have an urban and hipster vibe, but so do most local Austin coffee shops. However, I do like how spacious the floor plan is. It allows for more tables/couches and therefore, more room for studying or socializing.  My favorite drink is the New Orleans Iced, which has a sweet mocha flavor to it. All of the food are from local vendors like Tacodeli and East Side Pizza. Overall, I always find the food to be quite delectable. ", pos

Flightpath Coffeehouse ," 8/14/2015 Good place. Baristas usually play good music but today it is dogshit Timbaland and other crap. A customer had the balls to to say it was inappropriate for me to request a music change as it's ""not my place,"" to which the only reply is ""Fuck you. It's nobody's place but the owner's."" The new barista listened to my request for down-tempo music like they had been playing before (you know, progrock Rush is annoying as fuck too but at least it's inoffensive and not as fast-paced rhythmic) - ""I'll turn it down for you."" ""Oh, gee, thanks. I could also just blast my laptop at full volume to try to counter it. Let anarchy reign.""  Otherwise, place is full of:  Good wi-fi; good coffee; great seating; great outdoor access, generally great service with the baristas. But this music! I think it's the new girl (the other one is a very musical lady who likes dancey music, but this curse-laden rap is distracting as fuck when you're working in a public space). When I worked at a nice restaurant, one lady had the courage to write me a comment card that said, ""Your music is too loud for gracious dining."" ""You're right! Fuck this shitty EDM in a fine dining joint."" My attitude persists - treat your customers like they're the reason you have an unskilled job, and it's not an extension of your persona to come from your little hovel on Duval to Flightpath to continue to bombard us with your shitty taste in music.  Pl0x, curb baristas' terrorism of the iPod to retain loyal customers who pay you gobs of money.  PS good place for blind dates. Babes love Flightpath. ", neutral

Flightpath Coffeehouse ," 3/21/2016 Solid choice for coffee, I doubt you will be disappointed. The pro's include: (1) tons of space to get a table for yourself, (2) plenty of outlets so you don't have to awkwardly ask someone else to unplug or share an outlet, and (3) a friendly staff (at least whenever I've been). What sucks: the parking situation, if you really want to park in front of the shop. Parking in the neighborhood and walking a few blocks won't kill you though. But we are here for the coffee. The cold brew was very good, the espresso was ok (much better elsewhere). I've not been very excited by the munchy choices when I visited. Although I find there is generally an inverse relationship between the quality of the coffee and the number of food choices at many establishments. If you are looking for good coffee and a place to plug in, this is as good as any other venue nearby as far as I am concerned. If you want the very best coffee, you might want to wander elsewhere.

I just don't want to talk to them. And I'd rather not hear them talking, either. Flightpath, or rather, an introvert's oasis, is the first coffee house I've ever encountered that encourages this preference.  Even though there is plenty of seating (including couches,) it's usually pretty full. I've had to do the initially awkward ""can I share this table with you if I promise to be quiet?"" thing more than once. But that's the beauty of the coffeehouse: it can be crowded and quiet at the same time! My favorite seats in the house are up front where the windows are. The back tends to be a little on the warm side, and natural lighting is nil.  As for the coffee,  I love love love their vanilla latte. I don't know what they do differently, or if it's actually nothing special and I'm just enamored because I love the atmosphere so much, but whatever. It's great and I don't care why.

I *always* get my work done here! and I know other people have that ""Flightpath Syndrome"" too cause it's usually the same old regulars coming in and out.

They also serve the best chai latte in town. Most of the baristas are friendly, except for that one that looks like Elvira, Mistress of the Dark... Not sure how she fits into the awesome staff there - she's got a nasty attitude and is always rude.    The only other downside I would note is parking, but it's not terrible.

I discovered this place while laid off during the Government shutdown & if I lived in the area I'd be a frequent customer. What gives this place 4 stars is the attitude of the barrista when asking for a tea recommendation. I know that she ""wasn't a doctor"", but as a former barrista I know you're supposed to be able to describe your products. Luckily my experience helped me pick the right tea but it still irks me...

It's been around since it really was in the Mueller flightpath (forever ago.. ie - they have a myspace fan page vs. facebook and a hotmail email address vs. gmail)... but I digress.    Truly vintage vibe w/ 50's furniture & fixtures, **excellent** espresso drinks... which is what it's about, right?  Lots of little nooks for working and a ""quieter"" area in the back and a ""not-as-quiet"" area up front... plus the talkers and smokers on the 2 outdoor area. Outlets galore... table sharing OK, but there are lots of little places for 1 or 2 people and you don't feel guilty for being a hog.  They have pizza (East Side Pies), quiche, pre-made sandwiches, burritos & some other real food... plus fun imported chocolates & odd nibbles... then all of the heathy fruit & nut bars & cold drinks, just in case you are staying all day long and can't live on sugar and caffeine alone. (...meaning you are over 30).  Parking is a pain, but there is alley access - just don't tell people b/c I don't want to lose my good spot. I love the wall of ""to do"" things and I always get excited (usually post-espresso) of what an awesome city Austin is and how many cool things there are to do.  I love that I saw four different bike events and 2 triathlons mixed in w/ all the random liberal festivals, good causes and band gigs...

It's not a Third-Wave kind of place, but the drip is good and they also make a strange New Orleans-style drink with Chicory.  They have beers, kombucha, teas, etc.  Pizzas are sustainably sourced from some local pizza spot and they have plenty of snacks as well.  The back room is generally very quiet and has loads of tables and chairs.  During big test-taking-seasons (May and December), the place can be pretty packed, but still a good noise level.  Nobody cares if you stay there all day - the employees won't give you bad looks and the people around you are likely doing the same thing.  I've spent 12 hours straight here and, besides feeling like I was going to die from hatred of my project, I was glad I had a place like this.  The front room is more friendly to a few people sitting around and talking and the outdoor areas are obviously open to as much talking and beers as you want.

This coffee shop is closer towards the grungier side--the furniture and interior is a hodgepodge of everything. The front of the shop is usually crowded due to the lack of space but towards the back, they usually have more spots open. Weeknights get pretty busy but I think during the morning, it's less crowded. Another downside is finding parking in front of the store, it definitely can be a challenge at times. I usually park two blocks away and walk to here.  Their food is usually imported from other local Austin establishments like East Side Pies so don't expect anything fresh.

It Happens, Rude, Blue-d and Tattooed Flightpath does a great job of making coffee, having wireless, putting up funky decor and being quiet.

She's really pretty, funky style, dark hair, big feather earrings but sensed that i was inconveniencing her by asking for two prepackaged items: a diet coke and a tacodeli taco. Neither requires any work -- but I felt like I'd asked her to do something highly complicated and inconvenient. An hour later, said barista interrupted us to tell the individual I was meeting with that she couldn't have outside coffee in her ceramic coffee mug. (Mug? What do you call those containers with tops? Anyway). And then looked at Abby in disbelief when she assured her there was no coffee in it and stalked off. Dude, no one's bringing outside coffee. We're being green here.  I'm a pretty friendly person and I get that serving people constantly is probably quite taxing, so typically I'm pretty chipper and grateful.

I need to return and try the other offerings. ", pos 
Third Coast Coffee Roasting Company ," 9/14/2016 This place is one of Austin's best kept secrets, and my go-to place for high quality, fresh roasted coffee beans at a reasonable price. The staff is super friendly and passionate about coffee while being entirely unpretentious. Although you can buy the beans at Central Market, they are fresher (and cheaper) straight from the roastery. And you can ask them about their favorites roasted earlier in the week!  By the way, this is not a counter service coffee shop, but a roastery that sells coffee beans. Make sure you grab a free sample behind the bar! ", pos 
Third Coast Coffee Roasting Company ," 10/15/2016 Such a cool place. I love that we got to go behind the bar and make up cups of coffee just like we were family or friends. I got the milk out of the fridge and the hanging chipped coffee cup off the wall. It just made it feel so inviting. They have the roasting going on out in the open so you can see what's up, smell beans and talk coffee with the other coffee nerds. We grabbed a couple of bags to bring home. Both smelled really unique and I am dying to put them in my mouth :) The coffee we tried when we were there was the Nicaragua. It was bright without being overly acidic and tasted like something you would want to drink with a good book and a cat in your lap. Think comfort food coffee. We will be back next time we are in town for sure. Roasting ", pos 
Third Coast Coffee Roasting Company ," 5/28/2016 1 check-in Totally love the concept and the coffee! We had a meeting close by and my girlfriend brought me in here as I said I needed another injection of caffeine. Walked in and saw a great coffee machine and syrups in a coffee bar style design on the right but no Baristas.  Left hand side I saw people behind the counter working and having fun. Pounds of coffee in bags and the hustle and bustle that caffeine gives me.  My girlfriend went behind the counter and i was so confused cause I didn't think we were allowed. She poured me some coffee and I loved it. We started talking to the people there and I noticed there was a yelp check in offer to buy some coffee. So I did! Columbian and a lighter roast that the guy said I can continue to drink all day long:)  They don't sell the cups of coffee...this is a roaster and wholesale or just distributor in reality. They sell their coffee to other places in Austin. Coffee was great, people were great, I loved the concept and if I'm in the neighborhood...I will always stop on for my free cup of coffee (leave a tip or buy a pound!)

My husband and I love their new Coyona Natural. It's a lighter medium roast that has a really unique flavor that I've never found anywhere else.

Third Coast Coffee Roasting Company ," 2/6/2014 I love Third Coast. They're the best neighbor, ever. The coffee is superb, the employees are incredibly helpful and bean-nerdy, and the price is right, especially if you take the extra time to buy direct from the roasterie. They have a coffee bar area right when you walk in, and usually have a free coffee brewed to try while you're buying.  Just so you know: No, they are not a coffee shop, they are a local roasterie and only do distribution of ground and bean coffee by the pound to other businesses, or individuals that stop by/order.

Third Coast Coffee Roasting Company ," 7/28/2013 TO MY HOUSTON PEEPS:  I just drank some of the best coffee I've ever had!  I'm not a coffee connoisseur by any means, but I do like good coffee.  I usually stick to basic medium-roast blends, and not a fan of artificially flavored coffee.  I recently heard good things about  Austin's Third Coast Coffee, and you could get it at Whole Foods in Houston where I live.  I finally found it at the Alabama/Kirby location in 12 ounce packages.    Just by the look of the package, you could tell it was locally roasted and packaged.  When I picked up a package, you could smell the wonderful aroma of the coffee beans through the package...it smelled like heaven!  I looked on the bottom of the package and saw the coffee was roasted on July 23, 2013...and the date I was in Whole Foods was FOUR DAYS LATER...Saturday, July 27!!  No wonder it smelled so fresh!  I ended up purchasing the Columbia roast.  On the package you will find a description of the specific coffee roast, the batch lot number and the actual farm in Columbia where it was grown.  You can even trace your coffee on the Third Coast website.  I only drink coffee in the morning, so I couldn't wait until the next morning (Sunday) to try it.  Wow.  This had to be the smoothest-tasting, well-balanced coffee I ever had!  It was a true medium roast with a slight caramel, buttery taste that lingered on your taste buds after you drank it.  And I don't have a fancy-schmancy ultra-expensive or exotic coffee maker or grinder.  I have a ten year-old Krups ProAroma coffee maker, and a $20 Krups grinder.  When using freshly ground coffee beans, I do use Melitta #4 super premium natural brown cone filters (instead of the Krups gold filter) that doesn't leave sediment at the bottom of the pot.  The 12-ounce bag at Whole Foods sold for $12.49.  But when you consider it was just roasted four days earlier (in Austin) and how wonderful it tasted, it was well worth it!  I can't wait to try some of the other varieties! ", pos 
Third Coast Coffee Roasting Company ," 12/30/2011 9 check-ins Unroasted green coffee beans at $5.50/lb. Roasted beans at $9/lb.  The guy asked me what kind of coffee I like. I said: Funky, earthy, leathery, aged, monsooned. He then recommended the Ethiopian Sidamo dry-processed, which I grabbed 2 unroasted pounds of for a great price. They had some of it brewed up - it smelled and tasted like goat cheese - how's that for funky?! I love it. I also bought a half-pound of the roasted wet-processed Sidamo, which wasn't funky but had very bright notes, like eating ripe fruit - great stuff.  While they don't have a huge selection, what they do have is top notch. It's worth a visit here to get the beans at a good discount. ", pos

Third Coast Coffee Roasting Company ," 8/27/2014 Amazing coffee fresh roasted on site. The place smells soooo good when you walk in. It's not a coffee bar, like some may expect.They are working roasting beans, so that's probably why they seem occupied and not waiting for someone to come in and order coffee. Although you can.

Third Coast Coffee Roasting Company ," 9/10/2011 Third Coast Coffee is the best!  A friend from work (Thanks Judy) turned me on to Third Coast.  Finished the gift pound, then went to their South Congress location for more.  It's addictive.  They didn't have the coffee that I wanted available there, but there were plenty more to choose from.  I bought a pound of Italian Roast, and a pound of Mexico beans.  We were looking for something I would like, and they let me smell the Mexico beans.  I stuck my head in the bucket (if that paints a weird picture, it was really over the bucket, not deep inside), and didn't want to take it out.  It was a smell directly from heaven.  Needless to say, both the Italian and Mexico beans are being thoroughly enjoyed and appreciated.  I recommend going by their store.  Great people, great buckets.  Their coffee is unbelievable.

Third Coast Coffee Roasting Company ," 1/30/2011 I've been drinking coffee since I was 8 (it's okay, I'm South American).  I like a nice dark roast and I drink it black.  One problem that you can encounter is bitterness when you drink your coffee in this fashion.  When I met Linda who had a stand set up at Fresh Plus, that was how she got me.  ""Our dark roast is not bitter.""  She's right.  It's not.  I sampled and purchased the Italian Dark Roast and I'm a happy woman.  I have a coffee maker that has the grinder built in and every time I pass through the kitchen to the back of the house I will stop dead in my tracks as the scent of the beans reach my nose.  It's so arresting.  I've actually forgotten why I was headed to the other part of the house thanks to the beans.  I need to stop by one day and check out the facility as I would love to see it.  Meanwhile you can buy it at Fresh Plus and also online.  I'm sure they are in other stores too, but this is what I know.  Happy coffee drinking. ;) ", pos 
Third Coast Coffee Roasting Company ," 3/22/2013 These guys are boss. No, they're rad. Everything about this place convinces you of your (my) highschool belief that you can relax and work hard at the same time...and that work can be a place you'd want to hang out. The coffee selection is wonderful, and these folks appreciate it like fine wine or microbrew. They will send you home with a sample of anything, they'll pull you an esspresso while they chat you up and though everyone here is ""over caffinated"", no one is out-of-their-minds-talkie to make you run away in horror.   This is not a coffee shop, its a coffee buisiness with way less 'tude than most coffee shops.

Third Coast Coffee Roasting Company ," 11/17/2012 There are some businesses with people so honest and committed, with business practices so sincere, and with products beyond compare, that you feel compelled to share such gems with others.  Third Coast Coffee is a shining example.    From their modest storefront, you'd hardly expect to leave with cherished black gold in a cup, but that's precisely what you'll get.  You may also come away with an thoughtful discussion, and make a friend or two, but that's just part of the total experience that Third Coast has to offer.   They even gave my 6 year old son a lesson in coffee roasting on one visit, which not remotely the type of education you'll earn at your local Starbucks.  I luxuriated in several of their outstanding coffees before landing on the El Salvador, which is an intoxicatingly deep and satin-smooth brew that sits on an entirely distinct, divine plane from other beans.  No matter how challenging my day may look in the morning, just the thought of this coffee (freshly ground and paired with my Aeropress) is enough to put a spring in my step and throw a sanguine outlook on my day.  If this all sounds like too much, then you probably just haven't had the chance for such an experience yet through Third Coast.  I hope you do.  UPDATE 1/2/13:  I'm a scientist, so I love to experiment.  I had read raves about super high-end ""Bulletproof"" Coffee, which seems to be almost universally lauded.  Stuff costs $23 for 0.75 lb (with shipping).  So I tried it ( using my Aeropress, of course).  It was good, yes.  But the El Salvador totally BURIES it....at $9/lb.

Third Coast Coffee Roasting Company ," 4/9/2013 I'll never buy beans anywhere else again.  I was a dutiful Starbucks drinker (I know, I know), until I read about things like single-origin coffees, and how the health of the bean makes a huge difference. And while I'm lucky enough to live in Austin, I'm north enough to where I order my beans and have them shipped to me.  They're absolutely magnificent. The beans are fantastic, I got my order in two days, and every detail down to the bags is just perfect.  And, the wildest thing: when they say ""laden with sweet fig, plum, and smooth chocolate flavors"", that's not hyperbole: you can smell and taste those flavors like nothing else. Third Coast is turning me into a coffee snob, I just know it.  Update: well, it has been a few years since I wrote that review... and I'm just about to put in another order. I'm a diehard fan, and happy as can be. ", pos

He let me smell a bunch of their different roasts to help me decide, and he was also very helpful about explaining how their business works.  They primarily sell wholesale, but if you find a particular roast of theirs that you love you can call in advance and they'll set aside enough for you so it'll be there when you come in.  Also, maybe it's just more sticker shock for me, but coffee here is really inexpensive!  The highest quality at the lowest price?  Count me in. ", pos 
Third Coast Coffee Roasting Company ," 1/29/2013 After the demise of Little City, I was worried I'd never find another local coffee roaster to call home. Anderson's is okay, uses cheap bags and relies too heavily on their neighborhood clientele. Other coffee roasters in town seem more like a business designed to turn a profit than a small company producing a quality hand-crafted product.    Two years ago, I was relieved to find exactly what I was looking for in a local coffee roaster - fair or direct trade beans, roasted according to the bean (not the roast), fair prices (they're actually cheap!) and someone at the counter that knows your face. I french press every morning and get excited when I have a fresh bag from Third Coast. I can't speak to the flavor note descriptions, but I know good coffee when I taste it and know my preferences. I skew towards Central/South American beans. I've bought their Guatemalan beans (try the new one!) more than most. The Mexican is light, bright and perfect for mornings - Kerbey Lane uses it. The Peruvian is delicious - they use it in the Briggo automated coffee machine at UT, where I work. When they have it in stock, the Nicaraguan is wonderful.  I recently moved from 78704 to Hyde Park and can't make it to their humble store front on South Congress now :( It smells incredible inside! They always have a carafe of fresh coffee and paper cups for customers to take sample on the road with them. Thankfully, I can order online and pickup at the Hope Farmer's Market on Sundays. I'm currently enjoying their ""Special Purpose"" blend. ", pos 
Third Coast Coffee Roasting Company ," 3/25/2012 TCCRC. That is one mean acronym for a rather simple name. Third Coast Coffee just sounds a little sleeker. I mean, I can't even begin to comprehend where that term comes from or, much less, how to discern what it is referencing.  So, let's get down to business. This local roaster (you can buy the goods at the SoCo shop) cranks out a hodgepodge of caffeinated offerings. They roast all different styles and origins, but the hands-down winner is the Mexico.  The Mexico is rich, smooth, and, though it provides no hint of bitterness, provides a great kick alongside the rather sweet chocolate notes.  Yes, many coffee roasters now are ""fair-trade"" etc. and supportive of the environment and humanitarian in their efforts, but few offer the cool little ""lot"" feature as this fine institution does on their website. You can see why they claim to be very ""cooperative"" in production, sourcing, and pushing (hehe, I like using the term ""pushing"" now, with all the deal-busts and what not). ", pos 
Third Coast Coffee Roasting Company ," 7/24/2013 1 check-in Third Coast has ruined cheap coffee for me forever.  In years past, before kids and mortgages I bought good coffee.  However, the last few years expensive coffee was a luxury that wasn't in the mix.  Thankfully, Third Coast provides not only great coffee but fair prices as well.  I purchased a Living Social deal and came in to redeem the offer.  We picked up a pound of El Salvador and Double French.  I am not a coffee expert by any means so these varieties were both suggestions of the employees.  Both are great, but as I only have a basic drip coffee maker I think I prefer the El Salvador.

Third Coast Coffee Roasting Company ," 1/27/2012 I created a Yelp account specifically to comment on Third Coast.  I dropped by earlier today, after some Googling, just looking for a new place to buy java.  I don't know all that much about coffee.  I only know what I've narrowed down so far in my (limited) experience- I like higher altitude, water-processed coffee, and that's about it all I know.  I really dislike over-roasted beans (ahem, superchain coffee empire).  I like something with lower acidity that I can drink a lot of.    I can't hang in most conversations with people who know every little detail about coffee, wine, tabacco, all the finer things, yada yada.  I can't tell if I taste hints of leather and giraffe essence.  I just try stuff, and stick with what I think is good.  Well, these guys are experts in every little detail and more, but were not at any point snooty or condescending.  They were very friendly, open, and laid back.  They recommended their Peru based on what I said I liked (which, btw, was just roasted yesterday), talked a bit about their ""from the ground up"" Fair Trade business model, and the owner had just gotten back from a trip down South (America) to tour and spend time with a lot of the co-ops from whom they import.  Their hands are physically in every aspect of the business.  It was all very impressive,  but...  It was not NEARLY as impressive as when I got home, ground up that Peru, and had a (few) cups.  HOLY SCHNEIKIES.  Probably about the best cup of coffee I've ever had.  Seriously.  That might speak to my newb-ness, but it was really that good.  Light but still very flavorful, and I could probably drink about a gallon of it if I didn't think my heart was going to explode.  Just so fresh and delicious.  I'm going to annoy the crap out of all of my friends and family about this place, until they've all dropped by and bought coffee.  They will thank me.  I can't wait to try different varieties!

Third Coast Coffee Roasting Company ," 3/1/2012 I got a Groupon for Strange Brew that included half a pound of coffee beans.  I'd never been there before, so I headed on down and collected my prize.  It was half a pound of Third Coast's Ethiopian Yirgacheffe, and holy crap is it good.  All the way home I could smell the coffee sitting in my passenger seat, filling my car with delicious, spicy, amazing goodness.  If it had not been 1am on a weeknight, I think I'd have brewed a pot then and there, just based on the smell.  I could not bring myself to put this coffee in my grinder without cleaning out the previous batch of beans.  I ground up what I THOUGHT was two or three days' worth of coffee to take to work.  I will be grinding more tonight to bring tomorrow.  Today I've had twice as much coffee as even my sleepiest day.  I can't stop sticking my nose in my coffeecup, and then the coffee is RIGHT THERE so I have to have a little sip, and then I'm out of coffee so I have to fill my cup again, and the cycle continues.

If they have the espresso machine turned on when you're there (which is rare, I think) ask them for a Miami Vice or a Chocolate Rain -- they've come up with some weird but very tasty drinks there.  I heard their roaster's been roasting coffee here for 16 or 17 years, but I just heard of them from a friend a few months ago.  This place is wicked, dope and fresh (as my friend Melissa would say...)  Drink up!  My favorite is the Ethiopia Yirgacheff but I've liked everything I've tried here.  Oh, organic, fair trade, farmer friendly, etc. etc. etc. ", pos 
Third Coast Coffee Roasting Company ," 5/8/2013 Seriously amazing coffee and awesome staff, couldn't ask for more. I love that you can look up info on the coffee purchased with the given lot #. The price to quality ratio here is definitely high, coffee snobs please come hither ", pos

Third Coast Coffee Roasting Company ," 1/3/2012 I found Third Coast thanks to a coupon from Home Run.  I'm enjoying a cup of Colombian as I write this and it is fabulous.  It's so much fuller in flavor than other coffee.  Also, if you like the coffee at Kerbey Lane, you can buy their blend at Third Coast.  The staff at Third Coast were very friendly and knew their coffee.  As has been said in other reviews, just tell then what you like and they will recommend a coffee you will love.  So go by their South Congress location if you can or visit them on line.  You'll feel good about buying Fair Trade coffee and you'll love the coffee you get. ", pos 
Bennu Coffee ," 11/10/2016 Bennu Coffee serves up some delicious coffee and pastries, as well as having plenty of study/sitting space for the social and college studying life! Iced coffee is always my favorite, and this place does it right (better than Starbucks for sure).  I like how this place is relatively close to campus (even though I live in West Campus), and it's  24/7 (for all you night owl's out there...). The atmosphere is nice and homey, which helps to create a calm atmosphere for studying and socializing.  Now, I know a main concern about places like these is a lovely necessity called ""power plugs"". I can definitely say that there is plenty to go around to plug in all your electronic needs. They have cords you can pull from the ceiling, in the walls, extension cords and other accessible power plugs overall. So, you never have to worry about not having enough for your friends and family ", pos 
Bennu Coffee ," 10/9/2016 Heard a lot about Bennu and was told this was the place to go on my hunt for good coffee in Austin.  Went in mid afternoon on a Saturday.  Short line but most of the tables were full.  While I waited heard the barista making some snide remarks about people and their coffee order, attitude, etc.  Almost turned around and left.  I 100% get dealing with the public sucks and am all for good humor, sarcasm, and wit.  Might be saying she went a little too far..  Finally my turn and was a bit apprehensive that I would say/do something to turn the wrath on me.    Ordered the Iced Bennu which was worth every sugary calorie in it.  Also ordered a piece of banana bread which was great.  Found a place to sit and watched the show as people.  Great coffee.  Great atmosphere.  Will I be back?  Pretty sure the answer is yes.  Will just mind my P's and Q's if I do so that I don't get called out. ", pos 
Bennu Coffee ," 10/9/2016 I've had The Raven iced and hot. Prefer Iced for that one, get a bit more for your money.  Their traditional chais are delicious! Ambiance is quiet, laid back. Great study place. Gluten free options limited, but lemon poppy seed cake is great! ", pos 
Bennu Coffee ," 9/10/2016 3 check-ins THIS PLACE IS AWESOME! First of all, they are open 24/7. That's a plus when it comes to finals.  Second, they have affordable coffee that taste so good! I love how their mocha drinks are named after popular books. For example, Pride and Prejudice, Moby Dick, Scarlet Letter. Even just their regular house brewed coffee taste great! My top two drinks I order is the regular hot latte and regular ice coffee with hazel nut syrup!  Third, the interior design and atmosphere is perfect for a chill hangout, casual date or just to go study. There are a bunch of tables and seats. However, every time I got there it's always packed so you kind of have to fight for your seat. If you smoke or just love nature they have outdoor seatings too with cute lights hanging outside.  Overall I love this place and definitely recommend! ACAI smoothie! Peach, Pear, Apricot Smoothie $4.60 See all photos from Sara C. for Bennu Coffee ", pos 
Bennu Coffee ," 10/3/2016 1 check-in Fairly nice sized coffee shop in east austin.  This is my 2nd ever coffee shop to visit here, but the best thus far.  The interior is pretty welcoming and has many tables, chairs and couches to choose from.  Electrical drop cords hang from the ceiling so you don't have to sit along the walls to power your devices.  I chose the iced coconut mocha raven and a cinnamon roll to snack on while I was waiting for the Franklin's line to shorten.  This was a perfect start to the day.  I'd come back again if I was ever in the area. ", pos 
Bennu Coffee ," 10/3/2016 Love this place. Great place to get work done, a lot of outlets to work with, coffee is good. Customer service is fantastic as well.

Bennu Coffee ," 9/23/2016 1 check-in So this place is on MLK across from united way building. Which is where I was headed but needed a caff pick up. So I stopped here. First impression, which door so I go in. I'm In and wow this place is well decorated from first glance. Someone took time in this. Then I get to the counter and ask, what's good. I gave a suggestion, she suggested as well and we met in the middle. I paid. Wait, I didn't even say what size I wanted. Confused. 60 seconds later I have my Bennu ice coffee. Mostly ice but no worries, it's hot out. I go get a straw and lid placed neatly in an armoire. Then I look for a seat as a lady ask who's cell phone is this. So the ppl here are honest. The music I must say is very calming and pro 90's. Love it. Kinda slow and sad tho but I like it. They have this coin vault atm, no ide whyyyyyy! I find a seat and notice not one chair or table matches. Hah Then my seat literally has an extension cord hanging behind my head. What the heck, lol. Then I notice the menu painted on a mirror. This place is getting weird. I quickly sip my drink, yum and head out. Glad I stopped. Where the majic is made ", pos 
Bennu Coffee ," 8/26/2016 Came here for the first time and really enjoyed my visit! The parking lot was completely full, but I managed to find parking along the small road adjacent to the coffee shop (parallel but not metered parking!)  Bennu has both outside and inside seating, and when I visited (around 4pm), there were a lot of people. I really like that there is a big seating area with all types of chair-table placements. even with all of the people already there, I was able to easily find a place to sit.  Two things that I like about Bennu is that there are plenty of outlets and music without lyrics. The lighting is pretty dim, but areas next to Windows should bear enough light for those who prefer brighter areas.    Their iced mochas were delicious but slightly expensive in my opinion ($4+). I tried The Raven and Oliver Twist mochas, which were both so good! I also tried their cheese Danish, which was not that fresh, but I'm assuming it was because we came in middle of the day. Although not warm and fresh, I was satisfied. It was a good snack, especially paired with the ice mocha.  I was really relaxed and had a great time here, I'll definitely be back for more drinks and perhaps to study! ", pos 
Bennu Coffee ," 7/6/2016 1 check-in There's only so much work you can get done at home when you share an ""office"" with a furry, cuddly distraction. Sometimes you have to get away and cut the proverbial leash. With Bennu in my corner (and around the corner) I have a full-time office away from home, but still close to home.  The 24/7 aspect of Bennu lures in the tired grad students and undergrads of the UT campus nearby, but since there is tons of seating and plenty of indoor and outdoor space, it never feels too crowded. This place is not for the uptight, minimalistic, or claustrophobic, because the interior is decorated in Austin-chic. Cluttered, dark, vintage and charming.  They have good coffee, too. I always get the house, but they also have a dark roast. Coffee isn't the only thing they serve up though, they also sell pizza from Hoboken, Bagels, sandwiches, and tacos in the morning. Once they even created a Topo Chico mocktail as an ode to the late, Prince.  Whether you work from home, or have to do homework, Bennu is the right place to go. Grab an office chair, a cup of coffee, and werk, werk, werk, werk, werk.  P.S - to the barista who plays 90s country music, I enjoy every minute up until one of your coworkers inevitably shuts it off! ", pos

Bennu Coffee ," 4/7/2016 1 check-in I was trying to get south so that I can make a meeting. There was so much traffic that I knew I wouldn't make it... so a quick google later, I found this place. There's a small parking lot. I was lucky enough to snag a spot in the front :) I saw a peek of their patio area and it looks really nice; it has a lot of shade. However I was in a rush so I had to get in, buy myself a drink and find a spot!  On the door/entrance, there is a sign that there is a one drink minimum. Makes me a little sad that they had to post this up b/c I bet people some and just hang out and not support the business.....  So, I have a caffeine sensitivity so drinking coffee/teas after noon for me is bad bad bad. Good thing thing they have a selection of non - coffee drinks also! I did ask about the Iced Bennu and it's coffee with condensed milk (what I got from the explanation) and it sounds like something I would LOVE. Just not right then. I selected the Lime & Punishment! What a name! Topochico with limeade (!!!) I added cherry flavoring to it. It was yum!  Also saw signs for pizza... and smelled it but I did not partake. The music selection was not horrible. There was noise but it was still okay for me to work/study without any headphones.  The atmosphere is very trendy/hipster but I didn't feel out-of-place. :) It was still a friendly-ish spot and I think the baristas made that happen. I didn't realized they were 24 hrs!  I can't wait until the next time I'm stuck in traffic around that area so I can make a detour. :) Maybe I will try out the pizza also. It smells so good when they made it for others. ", neutral 
Bennu Coffee ," 9/28/2016 When I think of Bennu, I imagine the hipster best friend of your sister who is utterly reliable but a tad zany. She is utterly reliable for advice 24/7 as are the hours of this coffee shop, but wonderfully random and chaotic, which is the decorations and furnishings.  Bennu has ample space with numerous tables and a multitude of outlets, hanging from the ceiling and coming out of the walls. The lighting can be dark if you are not seated directly beneath one of the dim light fixtures.  Coffee is moderately priced with numerous offerings. The french press is a great deal if you order the larger pot and drink it insidiously throughout your long hours of studying. The iced bennu is one of my favorites. It has a great hazelnut flavor and is pretty sweet. I love that they use pulverized mini ice instead of large blocks in their iced coffee. Just adds something to the experience. The latte is pretty typical and safe to order if you are unsure. If you are trying to save, order the affordable americano.  They also offer a variety of sweets and pastries catered by different restaurants. The carrot cake is very decadent and quite tasty.  Parking can stink if you don't arrive in time to nab one of the front offerings. However there are many roadsides you can choose from to test out your parallel skills. ", pos 
Bennu Coffee ," 3/6/2016 1 check-in Q: Uhhhh, how much could I love this place? A: Enough that half of Austin does, too. It's 8:30PM, and this place almost looks like a night club on Saturday. Except there is room to navigate between seats and tables.  1. Famous for $4-5 mochas. Get one. I'm crying that I can't finish the other half, but I'll never be able to sleep if I do :'( (trashy first world problem.) 2. Street parking abundant. 3. Tons of communal work spaces, work counters, and individual squashy seats. 4. 24/7 for all of your late night study needs.  Low key and perfect for the Austin repertoire. ", pos 
Bennu Coffee ," 3/5/2016 1 check-in Quirky and cool coffee shop! (Think mismatched tables and chairs. And cord extensions hanging from the ceiling.) We tried the Bennu iced coffee on a whim, and let me tell ya, it was so good! It's a sweet pecan-flavored iced coffee. (You can't distinctly taste pecans though.. It's similar to hazelnut iced coffee.) I like how they use ""soft ice"" instead of normal ice cubes, and the small size was at least a Starbucks's grande.  I think it's awesome that they're opened 24/7; I'm envious and hope coffee shops in Dallas do the same! Extra plus: The infamous ""You're my butter half"" wall art sign is just across the street!

Bennu Coffee ," 3/2/2016 1 check-in Without hesitation, I have no problem driving from San Antonio to Austin just to study at Bennu Coffee...that is how much I love this coffee shop.    The idea that this coffee shop is open 24 hours massively appeals to me.  I have an abnormal sleep schedule, and having a coffee shop accessible when I want it is amazing to me.  Two downsides: parking and seating.  These two things are the reasons why they didn't get five stars from me.  Parking is very limited and the entrance is steep, causing me to always scratch the bottom of my bumper.  If you go during peak hours, there will be zero seats.   Other than these two items, their prices for their drinks and food are cheap.    If there is one thing that will make San Antonio better, a 24/7 coffee shop is a MUST.  I can't wait until I visit Bennu again. ", pos

Oh! I want decaf! I said. Ya, you don't drink much caffeine, so I thought I'd ask. Then I noticed that she anticipated the orders of everyone else in line.

Bennu was exactly what I was looking for...unpretentious little near eastside coffee nook where the seating was plenty, the espresso was strong, and there were enough computer outlets for everyone and anyone to plug-in and charge to their heart's content!  The very friendly barista did a great job of giving me what I needed at 2:30am...without judgement. My teabagged dirty Mate was just what I was needing after downing 3 beers earlier and the orange choc chip took the edge off of pulling a literal ""all nighter"".  I loved that there is an eclectic hodge podge of seating options (from barstools, to an array of office chairs, to hightop tables, to couches that look like engorged beanbags of comfy quicksand) and the people to match. I honestly think this place is the best overall demographic representation of the city of Austin I have ever seen encompassed in a single space!  The wifi is free (there is a one purchase minimum, but c'mon, you seriously gonna freeload in a place that has the equivalent of 101 flavored latte options?).  Should I ever endeavor on another early morning flight where painstaking awakeness trumps trying to squeeze in a two-hour power nap, this will be my go to!  So happy I discovered this lil gem!

Bennu Coffee ," 7/30/2016 I basically live in this place during semester, so I really have to love it. Good thing the coffee is good or I would be screwed! The Purple People Eater is a fucking godsend is you are looking for iced mate that actually tastes good and I'm a huge fan of the french presses and straight up espresso. If you was something a little sweeter, go for the Serenity, I don't think it's on the menu, but it's basically a dirty chia with white chocolate in it. And it's named after the greatest ship of all time. What more could you ask for? I'd get it based on the name alone. ... I'm not sure what that says about me.  Shout out to Knucky who is just flat-out one of the most kick ass baristas ever, and Charley who is just awesome and always beyond pleasant to interact with. I am absolutely terrible because I am totally forgetting the name of my other favorite barista....

It reminded me of. . . your lips and tongue and taste buds are thinking it's, like, a butter pecan milkshake or whatever, but then washing over and underneath and around and down your throat is this watermelon surprise. Next time we're thinking about cayenne and cucumber -- or I am, at least -- but also intriguing is maybe Irish cream or toffee nut with cinnamon powder.

Bennu Coffee ," 7/15/2016 There's something special about the sauntering aromas of coffee. When you walk through the door here, you are not greeted by upper echelon coffee snobbery with a side of middle aged angst. You are greeted by real people with great attitudes serving some of the best coffee in Austin.  Bennu is a hidden treasure among a surplus of modernist cookie cutter coffee shops that are taking over Austin. Now, I drink decaf. For a lot of people that may seem like a complete waste of time but when you have a debilitating illness, it's a comfort item. Bennu doesn't give you attitude with your coffee. When you walk in, you are not judged based on appearance or how much you know about cold brew processes. It's the type of place where you've just had four grueling finals and have taken more xanax your body knew was possible to handle. It's a slice of heaven, a utopia that's open 24 hours to cater to those of us that engage in academic masochism and work slave retail shifts. It's all around a fantastic community orientated place to just relax.  If you're looking for the fancy stuff, you should probably try elsewhere for your hearts and rosettas. If you're looking for a place where you can devour a slice of pizza in 30 seconds and chain smoke cigarettes like your lungs are made of steel, Bennu is your calling.  Shout out to Cynthia and Fred. They are always amazing but why don't you just compensate them rather than put up a weird sign?  Whatever, this place is great. I've spent many nights here pre and post-grad and it will always hold a semi-dysfunctional place in my heart. ", pos

I can also say without a doubt that while the entire staff is excellent, Neil, Fred, and River are among the best baristas I've ever had the pleasure to have behind any counter anywhere when I'm indulging my caffeine addiction.  ***** Original Review *****  Check it out!  Great drinks, a cool space, friendly baristas (imagine that!), and open 24/7.  You're going to love Bennu, my friends.  LOVE IT!  Be sure to give their signature mochas a try.  The Raven and the Don Quixote rawk, and, though I've yet to try the other five, I'm sure they're good too.  This one is a definite winner, founded by folks with ties to other well-loved Austin coffee joints (dearly departed Mojos and ultra cool Epoch, to be specific) who know their stuff.  There's good food on the menu (Pizza from Hoboken, breakfast tacos from Tochy's, baked goods from Russell's) to help soak up all that caffeine, too.  Get out of that chain gang and into Bennu.

If the only other options were Starbucks or Dunkin, that being the case where I grew up, Bennu would be my top choice, but I consistently choose Thunderbird over them (which I love-hate at 3.5-4 stars) so this rating feels mean but right.

Bennu Coffee ," 7/15/2015 This review is a long time coming. Plus tons of stars for being the most creative coffee shop in austin, having commmmfy sofas and tons of outlets and seating spots. I wrote 3 plays here, wasted tons of time in between east side meetings or came early in the morning when no where else was open.  Only con- Sometimes it gets a bit too noisy ( its usually super peaceful, so when this happens its a bit jarring.) Also they have the best french press decaf coffee- incredibly delicious! So when they are out of it, nothing else will suffice. ", pos 
Bennu Coffee ," 1/28/2016 3 check-ins This is a big coffeeshop with lots of seating and outlet plugs. The only terrible thing about Bennu is how dim it is. I was studying there one night and I literally could not see my keyboard because it was so dark. The coffee here is okay, I always get the iced bennu because its iced and sweet. The chairs are very comfy and they have all different kinds of chairs and couches and tables for you to work at. It's usually quiet here which is nice. Parking sucks because there aren't that many spaces and the parking lot is very small so its hard to maneuver your car around there. ", pos 
Bennu Coffee ," 2/15/2016 Supper quiet.  No joke, seriously quiet. Lost of space, and most importantly it was warm!  Not freezing like most coffee places.  Coffee was great too! Very quiet. Great space ", pos 
Bennu Coffee ," 3/1/2016 Bennu is a good place to get work done. There are lots of tables, chairs, and outlets. Like a lot of other local coffee shops, they do require a 1 drink purchase minimum.  I had no problems with the barista. Service was friendly and prompt.  As far as coffee goes, it's not incredibly impressive. I got a house brew with heavy cream. It was very very strong, nothing out of the ordinary for a coffee shop.  I will say that around finals (early-mid December, early-mid May) this place is PACKED with studying students. Definitely not a fault of the establishment itself, but just something to remember! ", pos 
Bennu Coffee ," 1/11/2016 1 check-in As much as I love love love Bennu, I have to be honest, the coffee here is pretty mediocre. If you're looking for a place to sit and chill for a few hours at weird hours in the night this is definitely the place to go. The ambience here is what makes me think of this place when I'm not in Austin and what makes me want to come back here at 1am on a Saturday when I just want to chill. As long as they aren't blasting Britney Spears at 2am this place seems to always be filled with people and is a great place to get work done. the lighting on the inside and the outdoor patio is dimly lit but there is still plenty of light to get your work done. There's plenty of seating inside for groups or to just work alone. This place is non pretentious and not intimidating at all which is probably why I love it so much. the baristas are great-friendly and charismatic and always seem to help you with more than what you are asking for. If I went to UT or a neighboring school I would no doubt be in here all day.

Bennu Coffee ," 8/29/2016 I love Bennu because it is a great place to study and have good coffee. I really like their chai which is much better than at other coffee places I've tried. The Bennu coffee its really good too. The cakes are delicious! The staff is friendly and helpful. The only reason why I'm giving it 4 stars, is because they don't have a lot to eat and considering their costumers stay long and I mean very long, there should be more menu items. So just know that if you get hungry you might need to go get food elsewhere and come back to your study session. ", pos

Bennu Coffee ," 8/3/2015 Good wifi! Pretty quiet and great for studying or working. Tables are a little haphazardly placed, some awkward maneuvering is needed sometimes to get by.  I got the Scarlet Letter which was nicely spiced, and my favorite part was that it wasn't blazing hot so I could start drinking it after less than a minute. Cajun turkey sandwich was basically turkey with jalapenos and a little bit of sauce, but I was hungry and it hit the spot. I also like how they toasted it. ", pos 
Bennu Coffee , 7/30/2016 I love coming to Bennu Coffee on Saturday mornings. I am greeted by the sleepy faces of Amy and Nuckie and we have a pleasant chat while they get my order.

Bennu Coffee ," 12/16/2015 Try their vegan pizza!  As a 24-hour coffee shop, it can be crowded as lot of students come for studying especially in the evening. I do love the vibe of the coffee shop and friendly baristas. They have gluten free desserts and I was surprised when I tasted their vegan pizza, it was delicious. ", pos 
Bennu Coffee ," 10/17/2016 Sometimes I feel like I should just pitch a hammock and move in because I spend a pretty good amount of time here during the weekends.  I love the cozy chairs and tables; they are perfect for study marathons.  And What better for study marathons than plenty of caffeine.  I have tried many of the menu items and I haven't ever been disappointed.  I am fairly new to coffee as I only started drinking it within the past year and the many of the things I do know now were learned here.  The baristas are always so nice to me; they're friendly and helpful.  Sometimes I am at a loss for what to order and they make me a Secret Latte Situation or a Mystery Mocha! I absolutely love that.  When I graduate and have to leave Austin, this will be on my list of top things I will miss the most. ", pos

Bennu Coffee ," 1/21/2016 One of my favorite places to work, especially with it being 24/7. Being right down the university (however only accessible by car), it is conveniently located to get away from the mass of students. I very much so enjoy the Iced Bennu here, being a fan of hazelnut. The ice is also soft and can be enjoyed as a crunch as you sip. The big downside for me was the wifi though, which is understandable consider the amount of client, but wifi is generally essential for most work or studying nowadays. I would really wish for better connectivity, either by upgrading tiers for speed, hosting a secondary wifi or limiting high traffic users. ", pos 
Bennu Coffee , 10/13/2016 I had their iced chai tea twice and both times were too bland. Their salad pastas is okay. , neutral 
Bennu Coffee ," 7/19/2016 Perfect place to study with your laptops, since there are so many tables and outlets. There was a lack of light at some corners tho, so be aware of that.

Bennu Coffee ," 6/26/2014 47 check-ins Listed in ""Nuptial Coffee Bliss!"" This is pretty much the exact conversation I have every time I go to Bennu:  (Putting my cup on the counter) ""Let's fill this with original."" ""That'll be sixty-two cents for the refill."" ""It's actually not a refill. It's my cup."" ""Thanks for being honest. $1.62""  (Twenty minutes later, putting my cup along with a dollar on the counter) ""This time it is a refill."" ""Don't worry about the sixty-two cents."" ""Thanks. Let's fill up the tip jar.""  Bennu is 24/7, it's usually crowded, and sometimes parking & seating can be inconvenient. But if decent coffee and hanging out late night at an Austin icon were easy, everyone would be doing it. They aren't. Some are. We should. Outside is sometimes far more laid back than inside...

Bennu Coffee , 7/19/2016 Absolutely love it here. It's a great place to study and the coffee and iced tea is amazing. Definitely coming back every chance i get. The only downside is that everyone loves it here so much that you have to snag a table quickly if you can. If thats the worst thing about this place then it must be great.  I would recommend my friends to come but i don't want it to get more crowded haha , pos

Bennu Coffee ," 7/6/2016 Now Austin, this is the place to get the tea latte in town! I moved to Austin like a year ago and this was the first cafe I visited. The service was friendly and helpful. It's a good place to study or have a long rich conversation with your friend, especially because it's 24 hours. Everyone's really nice, but I gotta shout out to Xy because they're the one I interact with the most. They're such a hardworker but keeps their cool in the busiest times, while making one mean Texas Gold latte. Bennu's worth your trip and tip, come for a nice cup of tea! ", pos

Bennu Coffee ," 2/25/2015 Listed in comfy, cozy, & chill Feeling sort of punny today - sorry if this review is a latte to handle.  The BIEN-nu:  + Their Bennu Coffee Mocha Menu is perfect for those nights where you need a cocktail of sugar & caffeine to keep you running. They're wonderfully decadent and the flavors are super...novel. Turn down the white & dark chocolate sugar explosion of the Great Gatsby? You...Scott to be kidding me. The Oliver Twist? You better have some Great Expectations for this caramel & chocolate medley of deliciousness. & I am not Dicken(s) around with you.  + It's open 24 hours. Perfect for those around-the-clock study sessions or those pre-exam grinds, if you enjoy being surrounded (literally, surrounded, because this place gets packed) by panic and desperation and sweat and the impending doom of approaching deadlines - but hey, that's how some people roll.  + The location is big, with plenty of tables and chairs and couches and stools and large tables and small tables and counters and outlets and plugs. Plenty of people sitting in them and working on them and using them, too, but like I said, it's a great place for those who need to be surrounded by productive people to be productive.  The Ben-NO-NO:  + Mostly atmosphere complaints, but, in my world, this means the universe (HA): too crowded, bad music, & too dark. True story: I remember reading my textbook (probably with my iPhone flashlight) and then jamming out to Avril Lavigne and then I was like, wait a second, stop it Avril, I'm trying to study and you're making it Complicated (actually, it was Sk8r Boi). If you're doing work solely on your computer and you've got your headphones in - basically, if you are a computer science major (working with...java) -, you'll be solid. But if you're going to read a textbook or take notes, you'll be blind and also maybe a little unsettled by the music.  + It's not very clean and the furniture looks like it just won a really difficult fight - it's sort of like studying in your grandma's attic, which is cool, I guess. Actually, I appreciate the mismatched, old, worn-out furniture, attic look - I just don't particularly like studying in it. Also, I don't like how some of the extension cords hang from the ceiling - I know this can't really be helped since so much space to cover and so many people, but it just bothers me, especially when so many cords are dangling so close to my being.  Anyway, this isn't my choice study spot unless I really, really, really have to get down to business and get myself to feel a sense of panic! Which I guess is often. (Honestly, I probably should have gone tonight...)  TL;DR For those people who communicate in metaphors, Bennu is that unpleasant and sort of depressing person in class you talk to only when you need something. I don't really know how to end this review, so I will just mocha-up another bad pun. ", neutral 
Bennu Coffee ," 7/9/2016 1 check-in Ari is probably the nicest, most talented, most well versed barista in all of central Texas. Her customer service is only out matched by her amazing ability to whip up the most amazing iced mocha you've ever tasted. Iced Raven no whip. ", pos 
Bennu Coffee ," 2/25/2016 1 check-in Bennu was a highlight of my Austin trip in terms of Coffee Shops Experiences! It was the first place we went to as soon as we settled into our AirBnB and it was really close. I was looking around Yelp and saw, oooh a 24 hour coffee shop?? Let's go! And it ended up being the most awesome coffee shop of Austin that I got to try. It is located right next to UT Austin so it was full of lively college students. There is local art on the walls. They were packed and there was nowhere to sit down so we didn't get to spend too much time there. The barista at the front was really nice, easy to talk to, and fun to interact with. They have a whole menu of mochas based off of classic novels. I still ended up sticking to an ""Iced Bennu"" which tasted strong, but subtle. It was the perfect coffee for me. But they had awesome mochas like ""Pride and Prejudice"" which I would definitely try if I came back here. It seems like a great study spot too. Only potential downfall could be the small parking lot, but I don't live here so maybe the locals just know where to park to get around that issue. ", pos 
Bennu Coffee ," 7/5/2016 I went here on the Fourth of July and thought it wouldn't be busy, but it definitely was! At first all of the tables and people overwhelmed me but everyone was quiet and working on their own stuff, and I was able to grab a seat. It ended up being nice and had the community vibe that is so great about Austin. I ordered an iced almond milk latte and it was good, not the best I've ever had but this place deserves 4 stars because of the atmosphere! ", pos 
Bennu Coffee ," 6/27/2016 Small snack/sandwich selection and the coffee is good. Most people who go there are working on their laptops or studying, so if you don't plan to do the same then you may feel out of place. It's a hip little hangout to do work and has a bit of outdoor seating available as well. ", pos 
Bennu Coffee ," 9/18/2016 Best chai tea latte I've ever had-- the foam was so thick and creamy and the flavor of the chai was amazing. The place has lots of seating, yet even at 11:00 PM almost all of the indoor seats were taken so you do have to fight for a seat. Service was friendly and not snooty. However, the wifi doesn't have enough bandwidth to stream Netflix shows, so I wouldn't go there for that (the wifi was out in my place and I wanted to watch the new AHS). Cool atmosphere to study in, though! ", pos 
Bennu Coffee ," 3/30/2016 I really, really love this place. Their coffee is delicious and I've yet to be let down by anything in the pastry case. I also have to give major shout outs to the sweet baristas that always seem to keep smiling faces, even at 3 am when faced with a grumpy crowd of stressed out college students like myself. Ya'll rock! ", pos

Bennu Coffee ," 1/17/2015 3 check-ins Listed in a latte love What Bennu coffee is good for: their $4 - $5 mochas.  What Bennu coffee is not good for: late night black coffee.  Bennu's is a 24-hour coffee shop close to UT campus. Because of that, it's always packed with people on nights you happen to want to study most. Parking is a pain to deal with on nights/days like this--you can find parking in the neighborhood, but even then, it can be a little difficult.  Lighting is super dim, the ambiance is quite nice, and decorum is really hipster-ish (that's the best way for me to describe it). If you want to study, there are usually tons of outlets and tons of seats (albeit kind of low and a little uncomfortable for studying here and there). Wi-fi is a little jank--it goes on and off, and you usually know when it's about to shut off on you because everything gets SUPER slow....  The service is super friendly! The baristas are great to deal with, which is saying something because many baristas at other coffee shops can be pretty aloof and rude. I've never had a bad experience with service before.  Their mochas are relatively sweet, but not too sweet that I can't drink it. They're good hot and cold and worth every penny!    If I go for just a cup of iced coffee or hot coffee during the day, it's pretty decent. Not amazing or bad--just pretty subpar. TBH, an iced vanilla latte is way better than a hot vanilla latte. Having it hot tasted like drinking hot, super sweet vanilla milk. With a hint of coffee. Blegh, too much sugar for me.  On another note, I can't say the same for late night coffee. When I study at 2 in the morning, I like a good cup of hot coffee to keep me going, so I usually buy a large coffee mug and keep the tab open. However, my late night experiences have always given me not-so-hot coffee that tastes like it's almost watered down (like you've literally just extracted the last bits of the day's coffee). It never really keeps me up awake nor does it taste that good.  All in all, Bennu's has some pretty mediocre coffee. I think it's great because it's open so late (the problem mainly lies in getting coffee to keep me awake and finding a spot to study), and the mochas are good.  However, if I'm going solely for a good cup of coffee, I wouldn't choose Bennu as my first pick. ", neutral 
Bennu Coffee ," 8/28/2015 Great little location to get your study mode on. Of course it being 24/7 is what makes this the place to go. The only issue is that it fills up very quickly and gets pretty crowded. Parking is also very limited. But hey if you manage to find a spot, you're all good. They have a nice selection of pastries as well as sandwiches and pizza. (They have vegan options as well!) As far as drinks go, I usually get the Don Quixote or regular hot chocolate with a warm muffin. Don Quixote and chocolate chip muffin. ", pos 
Bennu Coffee ," 6/8/2016 Gonna be hard to beat, I just took the barista's 1st suggestion, just said I wanted it cold and caffeinated, he nailed it. Happy I just moved near by! Oh, and I think it's a 24 hour Op, so.. too bad I'm not in college anymore.. Iced Blennu where it's at.. ", pos 
Bennu Coffee ," 1/17/2016 So as other have mentioned this place has tons of outlets and ample seating. If nothing else was right, they could coast on the pure number of plugs alone. I mean they have extension cords hanging from the freaking ceiling, it's basically their business plan. The coffee was fine and the snacks are sourced from good places. I am only going 4 stars because the coffee wasn't amazing and honestly it's a little dark/dirty for my taste. Don't think I'm actually saying its gross, it's a coffee shop, it is what it is. This is definitely a 5 star place for some people, just not for me. ", pos 
Bennu Coffee , 4/3/2016 I don't think I can ever move just because this coffee shop is so close to my house and it's my absolute favorite!!! Just moments ago I walked in and they were playing 'total eclipse of the heart' and I felt obligated to sing along to it while I waited in line. Apparently my enthusiasm was enough to earn myself a free drink from one of the lovely workers here :) so sad to hear that people get upset by the music here! Petty! , pos 
Bennu Coffee ," 8/19/2016 Good coffee and plenty of seating, though the place is a little loud.  I was reminded of my student days when I'd go to a coffee shop to study and get nothing done.  The food was decent, though I wouldn't make the trip just for that. ", pos 
Bennu Coffee ," 3/17/2016 This place is pretty great.  They have really yummy mochas and it's super cool/cozy inside.  There's a lot of seating which is also nice.  The baristas are really nice and helpful.  They have lots of yummy things to eat at pretty reasonable prices.  I have spent many a successful day studying at this location when I was in college, and would also recommend it as a place to hang out.  Unfortunately, parking is an issue.  Also, I would say their coffee is mediocre at best.  If you're going in for a beverage, I would stick to a tea or flavored coffee drink, unless you're just drinking the coffee to stay awake. ", pos 
Bennu Coffee ," 8/20/2015 I spent a morning here working from a laptop and it was pretty great. There are plenty of outlets, I easily found a seat, everyone there is friendly, and the vegan snacks were tasty. It was nice to have options for nutritious fare.  The only thing I could have enjoyed more was the coffee itself. My cappuccino was a little weak and generally lackluster.  I'll still be back! ", pos 
Bennu Coffee , 3/26/2016 1 check-in For what it is this is a great place to go to. Don't expect too much. People smoke right outside the front door and I hate that. If they stop that obnoxious practice I'll give them 5 stars. , pos 
Bennu Coffee ," 9/9/2015 This my second time at this great coffee shop and I love it. I ordered the raspberry tea, great if you want something like after eating or before going home. Today I ordered cappuccino, that was really good with migas tacos and for lunch turkey sandwich with pesto, yummy. The ambience is soft lighting and intimate,  great comfortable chairs enticing to relaxation , reading or working peacefully.  The staff are super nice.

Dolce Neve ," 11/2/2016 2 check-ins This is a hard review to write without finding myself craving gelato. But alas, Dolce Neve deserves a 5 star rating.  Dolce Neve's gelato is a little piece of Italy in Texas, and my favorite dessert spot in Austin. This cute little shop is a can't miss. Fun fact: The owner is from the US, and went to Italy to learn how to make gelato. I feel like I'm giving away my hidden gem, but this place definitely gets busy. There's a small parking lot in the back that I assume gets full during peak times.  I love that their service is friendly and patient, even in the face in indecisive customers who want to try all the gelatos (how do you pick two gelato flavors!). Everything is made in house and you can definitely tell - the gelato is very flavorful and creamy, but not too sweet and overwhelming. They have some staples, like mascarpone and lemon, and goat cheese and fig, and hazelnut. They also have a great variety of special flavors they make. I've seen matcha gelato (divine!), and sake (yes, the alcoholic one). Dolce Neve also offers gelato sandwiches and popsicles, which I've never tried - most of the times they are almost out of these when I go.  I highly recommend Dolce Neve! ", pos 
Dolce Neve ," 10/26/2016 1 check-in This place is super cute! Italian ice is always a great way to alleviate the Texas heat. I'd say Dolce Neve is very...Austin. The inside is quaint and small, yet very homey. There's a small parking lot in the back but I can imagine it getting full when this place gets busy.  The worker was patient with me when I wanted to sample basically every flavor (oops). When you taste it, you really can tell that the quality is solid. Flavorful and sweet. I couldn't ask for more.

It's one of those words which make you wonder if it's really ice cream or not, but it is Italian Ice Cream, and yes, it's a dense food, but delicious and intense at the same time!  Dolce Neve offers a huge variety of flavors to suit all taste buds, from the sweet lemon, to the relaxing basil, to the bitter chocolate, and the alcoholic taste of Sake, they all taste good and their flavors combined makes the ultimate gelato!  While the indoor space is small, the gelato is perfect for in hand indulging and walking around enjoying the scenic views of Austin. In my opinion, this is my favorite gelato place in Austin, also offering popsicles and ice cream sandwiches! Popsicles and Ice Cream Sandwiches! Front entrance at night time ", pos 
Dolce Neve ," 9/15/2016 1 check-in One thing I've noticed about the Austin food scene is that the focus seems to be on the quaint little shop, or food truck, rather that the 150-seat venue that seems like it's a scene from that romantic comedy you saw a few years ago.  While I do like romantic comedies, lots of times I'd prefer the indie flick that hardly anyone's heard of, but is so entertaining.  Well, Dolce Neve is a mix of both.  It's not that big gelato shop with huge containers of gelato, but it's also not that small shop that's a speak-easy establishment.  They have almost 400 reviews and rated at 4.5 stars.  That's extremely tough to do on Yelp without people knowing about it.  We came on a hot Sunday afternoon.  Parking is located at the back and on the street.  As I said, the shop is small with about 4-5 tables (depending on if you put them together).  I was warmly greeted by both people working there at the time.  I told them it was my first time and they happily explained their offerings.  They have a good selection of gelato that is hand-scooped into a cup or cone.  However, my eyes immediately focused on their gelato sandwiches.  My wife went with the salted caramel ice cream bar and I followed suit with a Stracciatella........... after my 3 flavors of gelato.  Yes, while my wife went with the incredibly delicious salted caramel gelato bar, I went the traditional route and tried a cup of pistachio, chocolate, and salted caramel (recommended by the lady who helped me).  While all 3 were spectacular, the Stracciatella gelato sandwich was calling my name.  So, I ""man'd up,"" and got that, too.  =)  Everything was so unbelievably fresh and comforting.  I wish we had time in Austin to go back.    Tip:  The shop is right around the corner from the ""Greetings From Austin"" sign.  Go take the obligatory mural picture and then go enjoy some damn good gelato! Ricotta Chocolate, Salted Caramel, and Pistachio See all photos from Jamie J. for Dolce Neve ", pos 
Dolce Neve ," 10/16/2016 2 check-ins Been here a couple of times and well it's the best Gelato we have ever had here in Texas! The gelato is always creamy and delicious and the flavors are always changing with a few staples that stay.  Both times we have been I have gotten coffee flavored as my staple flavor to always get and we got a couple of the other flavors that change. Each time each flavor is delicious and amazing!! The girls that have been there both times we were there are super nice and helpful, they let you try whatever flavors you want to try before you buy. Gotten a waffle cone once and it's amazing!! Apparently the waffle cones are made in house each day.  Overall one of our favorite dessert spots here in Austin and definitely a go to for us when we bring friends or family around for dessert when they are visiting!!  Come by and give it a try!!  Parking is in the back of the building and it's a little hard to get to so you might want to try to walk here if you can. ", pos 
Dolce Neve ," 10/10/2016 This is my favorite gelato place in the country. I've always had a great experience here but let me share with you some of the things that make it different from other places.  The good.  Fresh ingredients. They locally source the majority of their products.  Unique flavors. Mascarpone and fig. Sweet creme with a twist of lime. Tiramisu. Apricot jam and vanilla.  Variety. They switch out flavors every so often. Also if you want an ice cream bar or a homemade ice cream sandwich, they have those too.  The environment. 1st street is a true Austin experience. This place is near a bunch of art galleries and the famous Austin sign.  The staff. Always smiling. Knowledgable. Kind. Accommodating. They never get impatient when you ask for samples.  A+++++++++++ ", pos 
Dolce Neve ," 10/10/2016 1 check-in This is truly genuinely authentic gelato! Small place 'a la' Austin that has the best gelato I've tasted west of the Mississippi. These aren't the cheapest gelato out there but one sometimes has to pay for quality. One of the owners even went to Carpigiani Gelato University (Bologna, Italy) and worked at a world famous gelateria in Pisa, Italy. They apparently handcraft their flavors every day and I was lucky enough to try the Ricotta, Pecan and the Goat Cheese, Honey flavors (Wow!). They also have more traditional flavors but feel free to try out unique combinations. Nice outdoor pet friendly terrace ", pos 
Dolce Neve ," 5/9/2016 5 check-ins This place is a great ""Go local"" place. Locally sourcing everything etc. I feel like for a place that has such a great following they could have more creative flavors.  Limited Seating, can get a little crowded.  Gelato flavors they do have are very tasty, and the icecream sammiches are awesome.  If you're bringing someone in from out of town and you wanna sit and enjoy a while, I would suggest visiting in non peak hours so you have some elbow room. :))))) Yum Orange flesh melon and barley Apple See all photos from Meredith W. for Dolce Neve ", pos 
Dolce Neve ," 11/10/2016 1 check-in This is what happiness tastes like.  Dolce Neve has the most interesting combinations of flavor known to gelato.  They are creamy, not too sweet, and to die for.  Unfortunately, I can't find the names of the two flavors I had... but one had fig in it.  This is definitely a place I will visit every time I am back in Austin.  I can never say ""no"" to Dolce Neve. ", pos 
Dolce Neve ," 5/13/2016 Wandered into this place right after a wonderful brunch at Bouldin Creek, it's right across the street. Love the area and even the ambiance in here, the pink chairs on the patio, the clean white interior - a very European vibe. Staff is of course friendly, you can taste as many as you want. Saw them make their own waffle cones fresh. I find the prices a little high but I am assuming they use good ingredients. I have tried them twice now, once also at a corporate event. Not a big fan of the actual gelato taste. I can't tell the difference from ice cream and not as good a gelato as I've had Italy (ok that may be an unfair comparison) but for me, I'd rather go for LICK than eat here. I had the dolce neve and salted chocolate. Tiramisu flavor was decent. Didn't like both that much. I did see they have gluten free ice cream sandwiches, so next time I'll definitely try that. Until then.. Gluten free ice cream sandwiches See all photos from Yuvaraj V. for Dolce Neve ", pos 
Dolce Neve ," 8/21/2016 1 check-in I love going to a small hole in the wall, that uses fresh ingredients and tastes fresh. Especially when it comes to ice cream!  The ice cream here is delicious, and their homemade cones are even better.  I would definitely come back here again.  One down side is the place is not made for people to sit and linger for a long time, it is quite small and cramped if you have a group of people.  Also not enough seating or tables for many people to be there at once.  BUT THE ICE CREAM IS AMAZING.  Just eat and walk :) ", pos 
Dolce Neve ," 4/9/2016 1 check-in What a cute spot in the south 1st area! This little house has house made gelato, including some exotic but delicious flavors, gelato sandwiches, and gelato pops. All very beautifully displayed- which makes it that much more difficult to choose what to get.  I went with a medium cup because I was able to combine 3 flavors. My flavor choices were goat cheese and strawberry (sounds weird but my favorite!), organic coffee, and the chocolate chip flavor (it has a complicated name that I would for sure misspell). All flavors were sweet and delicious.  Though quite pricey, dolce neve provides quite the experience with yummy dessert and a cute little atmosphere. It is definitely a dessert spot to visit if you are in Austin! Medium- combine 3 flavors! ", pos 
Dolce Neve ," 7/31/2016 1 check-in Even though I only tried one thing here, that one thing was enough to make me want to come back and try the other things. I love gelato, even though they didn't have my favorite flavor, and they only had a few options left since it was the end of the day, I picked the salted caramel sandwich. I anticipated it being super sweet and that I won't like it since I just had a huge dinner across the street. It was the exact opposite of what I expected. It was a perfect bite! the chocolate cookie was bittersweet and it balanced well with the salted caramel gelato. I would've finished it all, but I had to share with Mr. fiancé. blah.. :) Mmm.. good!

Dolce Neve ," 3/12/2016 1 check-in Sample. Sample. And sample some more! This cute little gelato shop is not only creative, but delicious, too!  This was a great place to grab dessert with some friends after a heavy dinner. Not only were the staff super friendly, they had a variety of unique and delicious flavors to choose from.  What I really liked was the portion sizes. A small size really was a small size and they packed it in there. It wasn't too gluttonous, but just the right amount to satisfy that sweet tooth before a nightcap. If you did want to do dessert the right way, they had plenty of options to help you hit that goal! Unfortunately I was stuffed, but can never turn down the invitation for gelato!  I was indecisive when it was my turn, but the guy behind the counter was super patient and friendly. I tried the salted caramel, bourbon whiskey and pecan, tiramisu, and chocolate. I ended up with the chocolate and it didn't disappoint. They did have a Mexican hot chocolate or Mayan alternative (can't remember the actual name), but still, the plane Jane version of cocoa won me over.  They have an awesome patio to hang out out when the weather is nice. I could only imagine that this place is a prime hangout during the warmer months. I wish you were closer Dolce Neve, but we'll have to rekindle this romance the next time I'm in your neck of the woods! ", pos 
Dolce Neve ," 7/31/2016 2 check-ins Best gelato in Austin?  Probably.  Dolce Neve is one of those cutesy finds in South Austin (of course it is) that everyone likes to claim as their own hidden gems.  Wonderful flavors like fromage blanc with apricot or goat cheese and fig jam highlight their adventurousness. Classic flavors like coffee, stracciatella, chocolate and marscapone are executed with excellence.  They also have an assortment of gelato pops, sandwiches and cookie gelato creations, some of which are gluten and dairy free!  Unfortunately like everything else, their success is their biggest failure.  On a typical Saturday night you can expect to not get a place to sit and some of the flavors will be sold out but such is life when you want to taste the best.  Don't worry about FOMO. Go to Dolce Neve and taste for yourself and next time leave earlier! ", pos 
Dolce Neve ," 5/30/2016 One of my favorite ice cream places in Austin, which says a lot since I've been to many.  Their flavors are all seasonal and unique and delicious. Full of flavor and I've never had trouble finding two that I've liked.  Their portions have gotten smaller though and it's a little on the pricey end for gelato. Delicious though.  Also it's very cute which a beautiful white interior and a bright patio outside.  If you ever are lucky to try the plum one, it's delicious. Also their beets was good as well as their pumpkin.

Dolce Neve ," 8/5/2016 So, typing with nails is hard.. And I really want to clip them but.. Its just such a pain to do this every single month! WHY?! I am going to do out of my ordinary and just do a simple list and try to keep things simple.  I liked how they...: - Had vegan, and other food allergies and limitations for those who have those. - Clearly labeled. - SAAAA-AAAMPLLLLESS!!! - Choice of cones. - All made in house. - All made with local ingredients. - Had their own sandwiches and other novetaly ice creams. - Super friendly staff to noobs. (I was... gosh, so nooby.)  What I wish could be done better: - $$$.. ouch.... - Seating? But I know that is hard. - Oh my god that parking lot....  Bottom line: I really liked Dolce Neve. I will totally come back when I need that fix for Gelato and have enough money to pay for it.  Also, I like how close it was to where I was staying.  (Sorry guys...

Dolce Neve ," 9/26/2016 2 check-ins Great little gelato place on South 1st. Parking is tricky but don't let that deter you. Their pistachio gelato is not always available, because the owners are very picky about the ingredients they use, and this year good pistachio seems to be harder to source than I'd like. But when they do have it, both my wife and I love it. ", pos 
Dolce Neve ," 11/25/2015 I didn't expect gelato to be THIS good. NOT in the State of Texas. They quickly evoked my memory and love for Latteria's gelato in Miami. For sure, the gelato is the best I've had in the entire State - beating the bigger city powerhouses of Dallas and Houston.  The gelato here is made fresh daily - you can come early enough to even sample them as they're churning out gelato with their imported Italian gelato maker that's proudly (and rightly so) displayed behind the glass.  And the flavors? Authentic Italian, and authentic Texan. Italian in the ways that they have the typical Italian flavors (stracciatella) and the less-common Italian flavors (cassata, even with pieces of candied fruits!!!); and they have things Texan (whiskey and pecan). And they were all truly the freshest and great-tasting gelato that I've had in almost anywhere.  Of the flavors I tried, I loved the Whiskey & Pecan, Cassata, and Opal Basil. My cousin also raved about their pistachio flavored ice cream but the didn't have it the day I was there (or I just simply found out about it too late!)  I also was surprised that they have American style ice cream sandwiches - and with Italian gelato flavors. That's something that I haven't seen much of since most Italian gelato shops I've seen make their ice cream sandwiches with a brioche.  This is a must visit when you're in Austin - the caliber is bar none! Plenty of flavors here - more than what you can see here Ice cream sandwiches - even with Italian gelato flavors Imported gelato maker, nice! ", pos 
Dolce Neve , 7/2/2016 Yummy and unique gelato place. There is parking in the back but minimal spots. Try the almond custer and salted caramel! They have flavors that wasn't normal like goat cheese and wild blueberries jam... Anyways if you can do the drive then go for it! , pos 
Dolce Neve ," 6/5/2016 I freaking LOVE Dolce Neve~~~!!!!!! After coming to Austin I made it a goal to visit every big name gelato shop here and not that my take is very different from everyone else writing reviews for this place, but THIS IS DEFINITELY THE BEST ONE!!! (((in my humble opinion))) The gelato here is not too sweet and very light, which is why I like it more than all the other places!! Every time I come I stand around trying all the flavors because they're just all SO good and the workers here are so nice and everything about this place is just PERFECT  The decor inside and out is soooo cute and honestly I'M JUST SO THANKFUL THAT DOLCE NEVE IS EXISTS.  favorite flavors so far: stracciatella, hazelnut, honey and bee pollen, ricotta thyme and goat cheese, walnut, pistachio  ¡!!¡also PSA for UT students the 10 bus leaves from San Jac on campus and has a stop directly in front of Dolce Neve so take advantage of that if you don't have a car!!!¡! small stracciatella or however you spell it ", pos

Do yourself a favor and order one for your next event, it'll blow everyone away. ", pos 
Dolce Neve ," 4/25/2016 I like ice cream, I like gelato, I like sugar. So I knew I had to come check this place out. They make all of their ice cream in house and even make their own waffle cones.  Never thought I would say this but I think I liked the cone better then the ice cream. They have some how mastered the perfect mix between hard cone and melt in your mouth waffle. Unlike many waffle cones out there, they are either tasteless or rock hard. This one seemed to be perfectly in the middle.  The ice cream was quite tasty but I won't say it was the best. I do really want to go back and try the ice cream sandwich though. ", pos

Nearby we had seen this ice cream shop and set our sights on it before even paying our bill at dinner.  They were super sweet inside, and I don't mean just the gelato. We were able to try a few options before settling in with our choices. I'm always so amazed at how filling just a small size of the stuff can be! All those rich flavors really are satisfying.  On a scale of gelato from 'round the world that I've had the pleasure to try this was a solid experience - I was a fan of the flavors offered and the gelato sandwiches were super tempting!! they will also do a custom Gelato cake for you with a few days notice - I mean, what a birthday that would be!!

Dolce Neve ," 6/26/2016 We stumbled upon this place since it was near a restaurant we had dinner at. The place is tiny and cute. There's a patio with pink chairs and tables as well as indoor seating.  There were so many flavors to choose from! The workers were super nice and let us sample whatever flavors we wanted! My top 3 favorite were-  1. Dolce neve/house (egg custard and lemon zest)- this was so light and refreshing because of the lemon. It seemed a bit more like a fusion of gelato and sorbet. Just enough tanginess for lemon lovers!  2. 70% chocolate- I LOVE dark chocolate so this flavor was a no brainer. It wasn't too sweet with just the perfect amount of bitterness.  3. Organic pistashio- for pistashio lovers this is a must! Also if you don't like sweet things, this one is your pick.  I ended up getting a small with the organic pistashio and 70% chocolate since I was limited to 2 flavors with that size. It's enough for one person and cost around 4.50 which I feel is a bit pricey.  Overall, I likey! :D Organic pistachio & 70% chocolate ", pos 
Dolce Neve ," 3/14/2016 I walked over to Elisabeth Street Cafe and noticed Dolce Neve on my way. A sign that said 'local, Italian Gelato' was practically shouting my name. I love gelato. It is literally one of my favorite things in this world. I decided to walk over and pop my head in to assess the situation. They looked like they were putting sincere effort in here. As I did not want to spoil my dinner, I decided to wait until after dinner and head back over.  We were a group of about seven people and the staff was ready to help. I tasted a couple different flavors and settled on the chocolate mascarpone with salted caramel, because everyone knows chocolate and caramel go together like, well, chocolate and caramel.  The small cup is tiny, but they manage to pile the ice cream so incredibly high! It was good quality and definitely hit the spot for my ice cream craving. ", pos 
Dolce Neve ," 5/13/2016 1 check-in Really amazing gelato! This place, at least in my friend group, is mostly unknown despite having some of the best ice cream in town. The place is in a very tiny house on S. 1st, but is pretty cozy and has a generally nice atmosphere. Parking may be a bit tough - there's about 5 or so spots.

Dolce Neve ," 9/11/2015 1 check-in Listed in 2015 Reviews, Texas, Desserts!, ATX, Hangout spots Dolce Neve is just amazing. The gelati were great, and they were made all the more amazing by the passion of the owners about their product.  Leo was the person who helped us out on our visit, and since we went when it was not busy, he was able to tell us about how they got started. He pointed out to us that what you see is what you get. Their business model is all about transparency: everything was made in front of everyone. On our visit, he was making the gelato base and macerating strawberries. And there were no unpronounceable ingredients around!  Now to the gelati... They were amazing! We were able to try the grapefruit and mint sorbet, and mascarpone & lemon before settling on the gianduja and chocolate with orange peels. Everything we tried was divine. The gianduja did not skimp on the hazelnut flavor without sacrificing any of the amazing chocolate flavor. The chocolate with orange peels was also great with the nice citrus aftertaste.  It is a shame that Dolce Neve is not in my neighborhood. I can see myself hanging out here and learning more about gelato and really, just having a pleasant conversation with Leo.

Everyone knows about this place. In fact, everyone knows about this place and I didn't get the memo.  I've been here twice now and have loved everything I tried. They have unique pairings like goat cheese, honey, and black/blueberry and classics like stracciatella that just...make you feel so warm and fuzzy inside because of the memories these flavors elicit.  THEY ALSO HAVE POPS! Like, chocolate covered gelato pops! This is my favorite. The chocolate that they use is exceptional, dark, but not too bitter. Also, gelato sandwiches.  It is a bit pricy but for quality product, a splurge isn't so hard to reconcile from time to time. Plus, the flavors are so out of this world...makes me want to go back! ", pos 
Dolce Neve ," 8/29/2016 Dolce Neve, you are a little piece of Italy in the heart of Austin and I love you so much.  The gelato was so delicious, and tasted really similar to the gelato I had in Italy! It is melt in your mouth good.  I tried the raw pistachio gelato which was AMAZING.   I went on a Sunday afternoon and it was PACKED to the brim.  Finding seating may be difficult as the shop is very small, and there are only about 3 tables inside and 3 outside.

I will come here any chance I get! :)  My favorite flavor of all time is their black raspberry coconut gelato. It is so pretty and tastes so good. (Coconut haters stay away). I also hate raspberries, but I don't think this has a very strong raspberry flavor! I also like their Dolce Crema (?) flavor which is like an egg custard with lemon flavor. The workers are super nice (especially Janice! hehe), and the portions are worth what you pay.  They also have yummy gelato sandwiches I have yet to try. Will try eventually!! A con would be that they do not offer a lot of sorbet flavors. They will usually have one or maybe two, but I feel like they don't rotate it as often as the gelato flavors. The good sorbet flavors are lemon and grapefruit.  The whole shop is really cute. They do have limited seats though (indoor and outdoor). Another plus is they have private parking in the back.

Walked here from a taco food truck a few blocks away although I will repeat what other Yelpers mentioned, they have a private parking lot in the back. It was around 10pm and the place was pretty full, all the tables and seats were taken. After reviewing the options the server recommended I try some flavors including vanilla basil and chocolate orange. It was like a flavorful party in my mouth! I was also told that they partner with local farms and shops so much of the flavors change according to what items are in season and fresh.  I tried the two flavors together and it was so delicious. Creamy consistency and lasted for 20 mins without melting to soup. Also ordered a plain shot of espresso which reminded me of my cafe days in Buenos Aires. *sigh* As memory serves, Dolce Neve was on point giving a full service and nostalgic experience worth every expensive penny. I was lucky to get a seat and table before a huge line of people came in. Space is limited so if you come with a group of four or more keep that in mind.

Cute little house on S. 1st, full of folks at 10p.m. on a Friday night.  Amazing choices and so many that I wanted to try.  Having become a bit annoyed with the guy in front of us who held up the line trying all of them... I decided to dive right in.    Don't let the high price scare you to death, I ordered the small and not only were they able/willing to put two flavors in there, they packed it in like you wouldn't believe.  I selected a salted chocolate that I adored and a toasted hazelnut that was a little sweet for me. Mixed, this was my perfect ""sweet"" spot.  My man chose the namesake flavor, which is a custardy, melt in your mouth, perfect sweetness with a hint of lemon.  I could probably eat that all day long. ", pos

Their gelato cups look super small at first for the price but you're paying for all natural, fresh, organic goodness. They usually have 10 or more flavors on the menu so there's a good variety to choose from. You can choose 2 flavors for the small cup (~$4), 3 flavors for the medium cup(~$5.5) and 4 flavors for the large (~$7). They also have vegan options made with coconut milk! My favorites are the hazelnut and the salted caramel.  There is lots of free parking in the back although seating is limited in the store. However people come and go frequently so there's usually always an empty seat whether outside on the patio or inside. The purple flavor is vegan! Made with coconut milk ", pos 
Dolce Neve ," 5/3/2015 Updated review 14 check-ins My fave flavor is their Stracciatella and I always call before heading over to see if they have it. They're never impatient and will even pull it out from the back freezer for me!  Writing an update because we walked in the other day and when they didn't have any of my lovely Stracciatella, I politely said I would come back later when they did. I usually will get other flavors but I just hard a hardcore craving that day. The owner was there and said he would MAKE a whole batch of it and that it would be ready in 30 mins.  Now THAT is service. Five stars again for Dolce Neve. Heaven I'm in heaven Owner hand cutting strawberries for Strawberry Mascarpone gelato! ", pos 
Dolce Neve ," 10/29/2015 Found this place on Yelp and I ca see why it's rated so well! When something tastes really good and has a strong but developed flavor, I get a certain awesome food sensation that I just have to verbally describe. The Salted caramel was the bomb. Tiramisu was legit. Dolce Neve rocks my socks. Great customer service, and while it's busy, they aren't pushy and are willing to let you try several flavors and await your decision. And it's busy rightfully so! Yet still somehow, the locale has a very quaint old-house ambiance, which goes nicely with the creamy ice cream / gelato. I won't forget you, Dolce Neve... ", pos

Dolce Neve ," 7/9/2016 Yum! And my first impression was: aww, what a cute gelato shop :)  I asked the guy who was helping me what his fav flavors were and which two would be a good combo - going by his suggestion, I got the chocolate with candied orange peels and fromage blanc with apricot jam. Both were strong flavors by themselves and combined, created an interesting and tasty concoction.  I thought their flavor selections were fairly unique. But the prices are a bit high - it was a little over $4 for a small (2 scoops). ", pos 
Dolce Neve , 5/17/2016 Tried this place over the weekend and it was delicious! The waffle cone was great and fresh. Their flavors are unique and different but every flavor I tried plented together well and was great.I can't wait to be back to try all the other flavors!

The gelato comes in cute containers so you cant see what they scoop. I saw the flavors and wasnt really impressed so I got the pistachio ice cream cookie. I thought overall it was good but nothing to make me crave it. Hmm I wish I was a fan as I usually am with gelato but just wasnt sold. Pistachio ", neutral 
Dolce Neve ," 2/13/2016 I went here last year (2015) for my birthday, February 20th! I've finally got to posting a review a year later haha... Anyways, I went with my friend and when we walked in, the place was really cute! It was a bit small, but it's all good. The workers let us taste test any of the flavors we asked for and were polite.  I got vanilla and salted caramel and my friend got chocolate and earl grey tea! I highly recommend the salted caramel! The flavors were very enriching as well as light.  I would definitely go back to this place. It's a nice atmosphere with good employees and the gelato is well made. ", pos 
Dolce Neve ," 11/22/2015 4 check-ins I'm pretty biased because one of my good friends, Allison Y., used to work here, so whenever I'm in Austin, this is the first ice cream/gelato/cold treat shop I think to go to. I like the different flavors and that they're always making new ones so I feel like I never get the same flavors, except salted caramel. That one's a classic. They let you try any flavor you like and as many as you like. My friends each tried six flavors last time, and the servers were super friendly. Their popsicles are good, too. Even though the cups look small, they actually contain quite a bit of gelato! I like their waffle cones, too, which are never stale to me.  I do not like that they only have a few chairs and tables. Whenever I come, I always come in groups, and we have to move the chairs around or there aren't enough chairs. Also, parking kind of sucks. There are only 5 or so unmarked spaces in the tiny ""backyard"" and getting in and out almost always makes me feel like I'm going to hit a pedestrian.  Still, the gelato is good enough to keep me coming back without a second thought! ", pos 
Dolce Neve ," 6/18/2016 It was delicious but not lifechanging. I tried most of the flavors and they were definitely good. I had the dulce neve(yellow), sweet corn and blueberry and chocolate 70%.  The total came out to $5.60 for a medium. I would recommend the medium bc the small( which is significantly smaller) is around $4.50.

I could not even recall what extremely unusual flavors I picked out, but I was so drawn to all-things-odd that I picked two strange combos, and those Gods just shoved it in tight and stacked it up tall for me to enjoy.

Dolce Neve ," 8/25/2015 3 check-ins I heard about this gem from a friend who also knows his food. I was in Austin for a week, and I visited this spot twice in that time. The gelati are amazing, and the flavors offered change every day. When I went by on a Saturday afternoon, one of the owners was making a fresh batch. I wish I could have tried it right then and there, but good things take time.  The first time I went in, I asked one of the staff which two flavors I absolutely had to try since I am not often in Austin. She looked unsure and proceeded to sell me on every flavor they had that day. Having run out of flavors to introduce, she told me to try all of them if they all sounded interesting, and I did after her gentle arm-twisting. After careful deliberation, I decided on the peach sorbet with mascarpone and fig gelato in a small cup. I savored every tiny bite.  The second time, I tried another copious number of flavors and went for the Crema Dolce Neve (egg custard with lemon) and chocolate with candied orange peels. Again, mind-blowing.  Next time I'm in town, I'm definitely going to try their gelato sandwiches and gelato pops. Thai basil + buttermilk with butternut squash and sage in a waffle cone. Behind is the big gelato machine where the magic happens. It's hot out, baby!

Dolce Neve ," 9/20/2015 5 check-ins Awesome experience! Great tasting gelato and even better service.  They have so many varieties of different flavors. Some may not appeal to you, but I encourage you to try as many as possible in order to find your perfect flavor. The best part is that the workers are super friendly and let you try as many as you want. Sometimes when I go into ice cream shops and try a bunch of flavors the workers don't seem too happy, but the people here want you to try as many as you want!  I had a small with the dolce neve flavor (I think that's what it was called.... It was lemon and egg custard I believe?) and pistachio. The pistachio was OUT OF THIS WORLD. You have to try this flavor. It's not like regular pistachio ice cream. The pistachio nuttiness comes through so well and rich. At first it was very strong, but as I ate it the smoothness took over and I was sold. The other flavor was great as well! The lemon made the flavor lighter and counteracted the richness of the pistachio really well.  The environment of the place makes it feel like your grandmas house. I can't wait to come back and try some more stuff! The ice cream is more on the expensive side, but the flavors and experience are well worth the price! Pistachio and dolce Neve(? It's the egg custard and lemon zest one) ", pos

Dolce Neve ," 9/30/2015 My interaction here was small, but the staff was friendly and let me taste whatever I wanted. I'm into goat cheese and was pretty decided when I saw it, but entertained other flavors.  The tiniest cup even felt like too much, it will feel pretty steep for the size ($4 and change) until you start eating it and you're like did I need this much? Was there a smaller size? Will I finish it? You might doubt yourself depending on your food intake prior, but I believe in you.  A single scoop really goes a long way. So don't forget that.  The coffee situation made me a baby bit sad. I was batted away from a latte when the staff told me the almond milk doesn't foam well. And that's okay, I appreciate their dedication to technique. I ended up walking a block or two down to the food truck park to get a cup at Holy Cocoa so things worked out. They really did, thanks for caring. ", pos 
Dolce Neve ," 5/5/2016 1 check-in I made it a goal to hit up all the ice cream and gelato spots in Austin. Being raised here for all my life, you would think I could easily complete that task but alas no.  Something about this cute little spot makes me want to come back every time I crave sugar. Perhaps its because it's located in a semi-secluded area, where many tourists don't go and the workers as well as the customers always seem familiar.  It's like a little piece of heaven that's not crowded, and even when it is, it still provides that dainty homey feel. How's that for descriptive adjectives?  Aside from the atmosphere, their gelato never disappoints, no matter what flavor you choose. The inside of the house is adorable and I just  love everything about this hidden gem. ", pos

Dolce Neve ," 2/21/2015 1 check-in I'm not a big ice cream fan, but Dolce Neve is definitely one of my favorite places to get ice cream if I'm ever craving it. Actually, it's probably one of two places in Austin that I'll only get ice cream at. They have a plethora of unique flavors so I would definitely ask to sample some of the flavors. The staff here is really nice and always willing to give out suggestions.  The place itself is cute and small. It can get pretty crowded in here, depending on when you come. Nonetheless, the line moves pretty fast. There is seating available inside, but if all the tables are taken, you can eat your ice cream in the car. Haha.  ""You scream. I scream.

Dolce Neve ," 1/7/2015 1 check-in Listed in The Attraction of Austin We were really excited to have a true showdown between Dolce Neve and Lick, but alas, Dolce Neve is gelato, not ice cream.    Difference between ice cream and gelato? huffingtonpost.com/2013/…  Similar to Lick, the nice lady at Dolce Neve did not get irritated with our million requests for samples.  :)  The last sample I tried was just to humor the better half, whose favorite flavors do not typically align with my own.  Don't spread the word, but I'm glad I listened - you MUST try the pistachio - this flavor alone took the establishment from four to five stars.  It's as if they took an already scrumptious food, and made it into the very best version of itself.  Now that my appetite is bigger than it was when I was standing in the store, I wish I had also ordered one of their amazing-looking ice cream sandwiches.  I overheard someone saying that it tasted like a lemon bar...yum!  I wish I had one now.  Oh!  I almost forgot...the Chocolate with Maldon Sea Salt is to die for.  It's very similar to a premium pint from Phin & Phebes (from Brooklyn) called Dark Chocolate Salty Caramel.  If you're really into ice cream, check them out too - they're available in other states as well.  phinandphebes.com The chocolate with Maldon sea salt is spectacular ", pos 
Dolce Neve ," 2/9/2016 1 check-in Just found this place while trying to kill an hour waiting to pick someone up. They didn't have regular coffee, which disappointed me a little, but they have espresso drinks, so I got a latte. For their gelato, I highly recommend the Dolce Neve (the flavor with the same name as the place is usually a safe bet). It's delicious! Definitely a nice little place to kill some time and have some good gelato. They have a great selection and a decent price - I spent a little more than I expected just because they didn't have plain coffee, but it's nothing crazy.  I will definitely come back again, especially once the weather gets hotter. ", pos

Dolce Neve ," 6/14/2016 1 check-in It was my first visit to Dolce Neve after reading so many good reviews from people. The store is very cute, which is located on South 1st. St. in a small house. It has a small parking lot in the back which has about 5 spots. Luckily, it's a gelato shop so people move in and out quickly. The store layout is very simple. It just has a counter with flavors displayed neatly. As soon as we walked in, we were greeted by the worker. He offered us to try as many flavors as we want since they have pretty creative gelato flavors in the store. I tried Mascarpone with lemon, which is really good. The flavor was slightly creamy but balanced with the acidity of lemon. I tried many other creative flavors but I settled for the Mascarpone and lemon. I like how creative they are with gelato flavors. They take flavors that are not typically mixed together and experimented for a new flavor. I can see how this place has become one of the top gelato shops in Austin. I will want to come back and try more flavors next time. ", pos 
Dolce Neve ," 5/12/2016 I don't know much about gelato other than the ""Paciugo's"" chain, but this place is the bomb.com and seems super authentic.

Dolce Neve ," 11/28/2014 11 check-ins Listed in Treat yo self!, Unique Sweets Treats When we first drove into their small parking lot I thought, ""How Adorable"". What I did not expect was to have this cute store blow my freaking mind with their unexpected and delicious flavors of gelato!  I had seen them featured on Unique Sweets with their summer flavor of sweet corn and blackberry. If I remember correctly, I believe that one of the owners actually lived in Europe for a while where they crafted the art of gelato making and so generously brought it with them to Austin so that all of us could indulge in this truly special treat.  I was eyeing the honey, ricotta, and orange pistachio flavor until I was rocked out of my drooling daydream hearing the woman in front of me asking what flavor would go well with coffee when the man behind the counter said Fig and Mascarpone. Umm, do what now? I HAD to have a sample of that once it was my turn.  I watched him lift the beautiful silver dome and scoop out a heaping sample spoon. It was everything I never realized I wanted and needed in my life. Sweet, creamy, rich, tangy, mellow, and luscious. Sweet baby Jesus what trickery is used to make this heavenly goodness?! Voodoo?? Black magic? I don't care, I must have it!!!  My husband got the coffee flavor and once outside I took a spoonful of his and mixed it with mine thinking there was no way the two would taste good together. It was magic in my mouth and YES I know how that sounds! Their dedication to gelato making and using local ingredients clearly shows because the end result is nothing short of a show stopper.  The employee whom I am assuming is the owner, was personable and kind asking where we were from and how we heard about them. He was sincere when he thanked us for our business as we paid and left, asking us to please return. As if he needed to ask! I love you Dolce Neve. Marry me? My husband says he's cool with it.

Dolce Neve ," 12/23/2015 2 check-ins One of my favorite ice cream places in Austin for sure! It's been a while since I've had gelato i Italy, but from what I remember, this place definitely fulfills and satisfies my gelato cravings!  I got the dolce neve, pistachio, salted caramel, and vanilla the last time I came here. All delicious flavors. While I wish some flavors had been kicked up a little bit, I still loved the creaminess and sweetness that each flavor delivered. My favorites are the pistachio and dolce neve by far, not only because of the lightness of the gelato itself but also because of the bright flavors! I happen to love pistachio ice cream of any variety, and this probably tops my list of pistachio favorites! I also am a sucker for anything lemon so the dolce neve (egg custard with lemon zest) definitely satisfied my lemon craving without giving me anything too mouth puckeringly sour!  An Austin favorite that I definitely will return to! ", pos

I love how you never come back to the same set of flavors (even if you go twice in a week), because they make their gelato in small batches and rotate flavors.  A couple of the interesting/stand-out flavors I've had:  - Cassata: I just tried the flavor this past weekend, and was pleasantly surprised. Based on a popular Italian dessert, the ricotta-flavored gelato, candied orange peels, and chocolate chunks make for a delicious combination - cheesy, chocolatey, and slightly tangy with a nice texture added by the candied orange peels!  - Blackberry & Coconut Milk: I am Filipino, so I really love all things coconut milk. I love how the blackberries added a sort of sour kick to the creaminess of the coconut milk. This was actually one of my favorite flavors that I've tried here!  - 70% Chocolate: I'm always a huge fan of all desserts that are thick, rich, and chocolatey. Although this flavor isn't exactly super novel, it's a wonderful classic.  - Mascarpone Lemon Zest: Also one of my favorites, tangy from the lemon, but with a cheesy aftertaste. One of my go-to's if I can't decide on what to choose!  They also give you really generous portions. For a $4 small, you get two heaping spoons (not scoops, because scoops imply a standard of size, I think) of gelato, and then some, unlike some other ice cream places where you pay $4 and receive two little, round, perfectly-sized scoops. (Lick, I love you, but you're holding back on me.) And, at Dolce Neve, they make the gelato in front of you, which is fun. The Italian man who started this is also great.

Thunderbird Coffee ," 9/6/2016 1 check-in Easy to spot and is located in a nice little spot. I didn't notice a sign that made it too obvious that it was the spot. Might have just missed it since it was my first time.  There is a small parking lot that can hold about 8 cars next to the shop. If you get lucky, you'll be able to get a spot. If not, you can park street. When I went in on a Saturday, the neighborhood parking was pretty packed, but you should be able to find a spot eventually.  The inside was pretty chill. It wasn't too loud either, so its a pretty good place to get some work done. There are a good number of tables  and along the walls there are some plugs, so it shouldn't be too hard to find a charge. Restroom was pretty clean, no complaints.  Coffee was pretty decent, nothing too crazy. They do have different specials every day so be sure to check that out before you get anything.

Also, perfect level of noise (overhead music + not all the bustling noise and sound of conversation).  Second time, during early evening and many many conversations everywhere and overhead music was a lot louder. Wifi was super slow. Suuuuuuper slow.  First time, I got the iced honey nut latte. It was ok, nothing out of this world or anything.  Second time, I forgot to order it iced, but I'm so glad that I did. It's so much better as a regular latte. Smells like a box of honey nut Cheerios and it's heavenly. Every sip smelled and tasted sweet and amazing.  There are A TON of seats. So when I say it's packed, it really is packed. I count at least twelve tables for two (spaced well enough apart) and two community-like seating areas, and ample outdoor seating. And there are PLENTY of outlets.  Parking is a hit or miss. Their lot is small, but there's street parking on the other side of the building. It seems like it starts clearing out around 7 PM. Honey nut latte ", pos 
Thunderbird Coffee ," 6/13/2016 1 check-in I got the cranberry turkey sandwich, and it was tasty for a coffeeshop. It was grilled nicely, and not spicy at all. I regret not getting the side salad (for an extra 75 cents) because it looked good. But, I was reasonably full after the sandwich. The staff was really nice, and it was a comfortable temp inside.

Thunderbird Coffee ," 8/17/2016 2 check-ins Thunderbird comes through with some really good coffee, and a nice atmosphere. This coffee shop introduced me to Wild Gift Coffee a couple years back, and that is something I am grateful for!  I have had some good memories here, too. The last couple of times my sister-in-law and her hubby came to visit, we've gone here to enjoy some espresso drinks, while playing a board game or two on their wood slab table. Even though their new paint/decor is nice, I preferred the old look. I think it's lost a some of its little house coffee shop feeling.  You can also get a free drink with the purchase of some coffee beans, which effectively brings the beans down to a reasonable grocery store level cost. ", pos 
Thunderbird Coffee ," 5/11/2016 1 check-in Stumbled across this little coffee shop after taking my car in for service down the street.  On my way walking back to campus, I decided to check this place out since I have seen this establishment packed in the early evenings.    Love the atmosphere of this place.  It has that super chill vibe where people can hang around all day with friends or accomplishing work if they chose to.  The house coffee was super delicious.  I definitely enjoyed the TacoDeli tacos that were also sold here.  Overall, I am a simple girl who like simple coffee.  Give me a breakfast taco and I will be a happy camper. ", pos 
Thunderbird Coffee ," 10/12/2015 1 check-in Listed in My Fix, Second Home Do you ever open a new bag of chips or cereal and immediately smell its potent concentration of flavored powdery goodness? No? Just me? Ok.  Well, the Honey Nut Latte at Thunderbird pretty much smells just like a freshly opened bag of Honey Nut Cheerios, and I ain't complaining. The sweetness is cut by the espresso and milk, which is perfect to sip as you get some work done.  Thunderbird has quite a bit more solo seating than other Austin coffeeshops, but personally it's a little too loud to be super productive without your own form of distraction (eg your own music). But there's outdoor seating, free wifi, tasty drinks, and friendly baristas to entice you to come back - which I'm inclined to.  As with most Austin coffee shops, parking can be a massive hassle - don't park at Hoover's, don't block any driveways, etc. You might have to park a couple blocks away and walk for a couple minutes, but baby it's worth it *insert saxophone riff here* Honey Nut Latte ", pos 
Thunderbird Coffee ," 5/16/2016 6 check-ins 3 stars for the kinda pricey coffee, but I love everything else. You must try the honey nut latte! Super flavorful and not too heavy like a lot of other lattes. Don't forget to grab a punch card!  The beers during happy hour are pretty cheap! $1 off of all beers from 4-7pm making most of them $3.50 during happy hour. The selection is typical: live oak, karbach, Austin beerworks, etc. They also have daily happy hour specials on top of the normal happy hour.  Wifi is reliable. Music is a little loud sometimes, but the baristas have good taste so it's okay. Parking is limited in their lot, but the neighborhood has plenty of spots. Overall not a bad place to study or hangout with people! The daily extra happy hour specials on top of $1 off all beers 4-7pm ", pos

Thunderbird Coffee ," 11/7/2016 I come here every Monday morning when they open. Thunderbird has made itself a perfect place to sip on an artisan coffee drink and ponder. There are quotes written on the tables, the music choice is usually something chill with thought provoking lyrics,  and The people who work here are serene and kind. It's usually busy later around lunch, but it's one of my favorite places to be at 7 in the morning. The coffee/espresso they have is also top quality. They take their drip as seriously as they take the espresso. They will even have a couple different bean choices for espresso as well, that are appreciably different from one another.  Pros: great feel, nice people, delicious coffee/espresso  Cons: expensive, but when you get what you pay for, it's 100% worth it. ", pos

It's sweet but not too milky, and I like the nutty warm taste it has. It's good either hot or iced! I've come here quite a lot since living in Austin, usually to study inside but on some occasions to hang out. The outside patio is great for the latter; the hanging Christmas lights make it really cute and homey. There are a good number of outlets inside, the wifi is decent from experience, but sometimes the music is too loud, to the point where it's hard to have conversation.

I was there early in the morning (so this may not hold true for afternoon/evening visits), and it was a good place to get things done. Plenty of space, quiet, good light.  Cons:  1. Parking. Enough said.  2. Not very fast service when I was there!  Definitely a coffeeshop I would return to. ", pos 
Thunderbird Coffee ," 10/27/2015 4 check-ins Thunderbird certainly gives off the typical Austin coffee shop vibes, and adds a bit of personality. Inside is chic and comfortable, and there are plenty of furniture and decoration pieces to be topic of conversation, such as a tastes and aromas poster on the ceiling above the register, and quotes written on the tabletops. It is also equipped with both indoor and outside seating - a cute little yard outside that is perfect for a cool morning.  I heard great things about the honey nut latte - my boyfriend said he read endless reviews about it on Yelp so we decided to give it a try. I would say it's a really good flavor - one of the best I've tried - but it was just a bit too strong and sweet for me. I came back again and opted for just a regular unflavored latte and was much more satisfied.  I have yet to try their food - and I can't speak for their latte art because I was given my orders in to go cups. But the coffee is pretty good - not too strong of a flavor but smooth and satisfying.  The one complaint I would have is that the music is always really loud. Sure, there is a lot of seating, so you might think you can sit and get some work done, but I just can't concentrate here. Thunderbird is definitely not the quiet, calming atmosphere you may look for in a coffee shop.  Not my favorite in Austin but definitely a great place to get good espresso drinks. ", pos

Thunderbird Coffee ," 8/27/2015 1 check-in Listed in Brunch Spots Brunch Review:  Thunderbird is dabbling in having brunches on the weekends and I attended their first pop up brunch a couple Saturdays ago.  I already enjoyed this place for the fantastic coffee but, now there is more to love.    I ordered the open faced salmon toast and it was well put together.  How could anything be bad with salmon, fresh veggies and hard boiled egg?  The only critique that I would give is that the bread was a little hard around the edges and was hard to cut.  I also ordered the egg and bacon torta and wow was it huge.  The bread was hearty but fresh and the only critique I would give on this one is that I wish the egg would have been a little warmer.  The food did come out really quickly, plenty of space on the patio and points for being dog friendly, as always!  I hope they continue to do brunch and I am sure they will work out those two tiny kinks in service that I mentioned. Pop up Saturday brunch! smoked salmon toast and egg, bacon, tomato and onion torta! ", pos 
Thunderbird Coffee ," 8/31/2015 1 check-in The coffee is pretty good and it's a cozy space...if you can find a table. And that's after assuming that you've found a place to park.  I'm glad Thunderbird Coffee is here in the Manor neighborhood (and I acknowledge that it's very loved by the community!). It'll be a place that I frequent in the days to come for work meetings, etc...but I will continue to walk into the place expecting to engage in a space struggle. I'm not sure if meeting someone for coffee should really be that stressful...  The baristas are hit-or-miss in terms of pleasantness. I don't always get much of a smile from them but maybe it depends on when you're there?! ", neutral 
Thunderbird Coffee ," 4/15/2015 1 check-in After an action-packed weekend, I was drained and phone-less. All I wanted to do was play Sleeping Beauty until I was back home.  With one hour to spare before dinner, my friend and I decided to make a stop here. The first parking lot we parked in was only for Hoover's Cooking, which was right across Thunderbird Coffee. Thunderbird Coffee and Hoover's Cooking are strict about parking. Try to find a spot along Breeze Ter.  As soon as we entered, you see how packed this place is with people studying, surfing the Internet, or socializing. Even though there were various kinds of tables and chairs with outdoor seating, seating was limited.  I ended up choosing the honey nut latte (4/5). I'm not a coffee person at all, but I am glad I read some of the Yelp reviews beforehand. It was neither too sweet nor too strong, was just the right balance! It is so much better than Starbucks, which is overloaded with sugar.  My friend spotted a cleared table with 4 outlets right next to the area they prepare food. One of the baristas was making chicken chipotle sandwiches, so the aroma was delightful. The sandwiches were prepared with salads as well. It looked like a meal from McAlister's or Panera Bread.  Most of the time I was people watching while sipping on my latte... Nice to just relax sometimes and enjoy. Overall, it has a hipster and welcoming atmosphere with friendly baristas! I would come back to try their food next time! Honey Nut Latte (Left) and Sweet Cappuccino (Right) ", pos 
Thunderbird Coffee ," 5/30/2016 Thunderbird has been one of my favorite coffee shops for years now because they execute well on the basics of a coffee shop: clean, bright, low-key, friendly staff, good drinks, plenty of seating (indoor and out), not expensive as fuck, wifi, not weird and pretentipus, plenty of bathrooms...  It's a super straightforward formula, and one that seems to elude a lot of other local coffee shops. ", pos

Thunderbird Coffee ," 11/2/2016 Overall, this is a solid coffee shop. If you're going for just coffee, it's great. Their beverages are pretty good. The interior is very spacious. Plenty of room for a small meeting, casual chat or to study. The patio is a good size as well, although it is a bit dusty as it is not paved and has no grass...just dirt. The employees were extremely friendly and though you are supposed to pick up the food you order at the counter, they will usually bring it to your table which is nice because they do not have to. They are very kind to all of the pups who visit and will bring you a bowl for water. My one complaint is the food. It is over priced and they pull most of it right out of a fridge where it is pre-made, pre-wrapped.  They throw it on a panini maker, I believe, and serve. I had one mocha and a sandwich and my bill was almost $14.00. Really? All you did was take the plastic off and heat it up. I will go back for coffee but not for the expensive food, wrapped in plastic. ", neutral 
Thunderbird Coffee ," 1/18/2015 4 check-ins Listed in a latte love One of my favorite coffee houses in all of Austin! I absolutely love Thunderbird! The coffee/espresso here is great. The baristas have all been really friendly. The atmosphere is really nice and friendly. The place is super cute and vibrant and welcoming.  There aren't a ton of seats/outlets, so that might be the biggest pain--finding somewhere to settle down. It's like war if you go at the wrong time. Outside seating is awesome, but I have never seen outlets out there, so it's kind of a hit or miss depending on what you're planning to do at the coffee shop. If you're with friends, and it's nice outside, then there's usually always outside seating available. If it's terrible weather and you want to study, good luck finding a good seat.  My favorite drink is the honey nut latte--it has the perfect amount of sweetness. Even when I ask for extra shots of espresso, it still tastes great and keeps me going for hours.  I've tried the Thai Iced Coffee--meh, not my favorite. It tastes like me trying to make coffee with sweetened condensed milk at home (my terrible attempts when I'm craving Viet Iced Coffee), which usually doesn't end so well. I've tasted better Thai Iced Coffee at actual Thai restaurants, but I guess the point here is that it's coffee and sweetened condensed milk.  The only thing I really hate is finding parking. You can park in the local neighborhood, but even then it can get crowded and be a pretty far walk. Sometimes, I get lucky with the parking lot. Other times, some person will pull in even though I've been sitting in my car with my blinker on. Parking is just the worst thing about Thunderbird.  Overall, love Thunderbird. One of my favorite places to get coffee and study! honey nut latte ", pos 
Thunderbird Coffee ," 3/21/2016 I've enjoyed visiting Thunderbird because they seem to have found a pretty good balance between serving solid coffee and dishing up good food. It can be difficult to find a place where you can get both a yummy prepared to order meal and a decent cup of coffee. That said, the espresso is a more inconsistent that some of the other top choices in town. Also, because they serve food, the service can be slower than the other places that specialize in coffee only.  This is a clearly a popular spot, as such, it can be difficult to get a table for yourself at peak hours. Not to mention, the parking situation is not ideal. Despite all that, if you want a sandwich and good cup of coffee, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend visiting if you are already in the area. But, if you want the absolute best coffee in town, this isn't quite the place yet. ", neutral

Thunderbird Coffee ," 5/24/2015 Visited Thunderbird for the first time today, Sunday mid afternoon. Parking is rough, but bearable if you just suck it up and walk. I would rec the bus or bikes if that's really an issue for you.  Inside, it's spacious and well lit. The natural lighting is wonderful and I like that you're not sitting on top of other people. There's also a lot of outdoor seating!  We ordered an iced soy chai latte and an iced honey nut latte. Pricey, yes. However, as this is not my daily morning stop for coffee, I didn't mind splurging.  The iced chai was decent. Could have been spicier, but it was good! The honey nut latte was perfect! Sweet and smooth, with light flavor. Baristas were super sweet and  service was very quick for the two drinks. We didn't order any food, but the things we saw put out looked amazing.  I can see how it would get crowded during the school year (as a college student myself, I'm not sure if I'd head here expecting a seat during finals week) but it's a perfect summer hangout. ", pos 
Thunderbird Coffee ," 5/6/2015 1 check-in Great atmosphere, but I can't get over the price of the single shot cappuccino I ordered. Are we in New York, Chicago, or LA? Even in those cities I know I could find a comparable hand crafted cap for less. But where are we? East Austin; although the grungy one-of-a-kind charm of this area merits its own price tag, I personally think whoever decided the prices was feeling a little bit too proud that day.  My cappuccino was good though. And my time spent here has been comfortable.  I would check it out for a laid back beer after work on their awesome deck, but maybe drive by in the morning and get my coffee elsewhere. Single shot cap ", neutral

There's seating outside with PLENTY of sunshine and we always get exactly what we ordered. Service is good.

The place honestly has a great feel for it. The chalkboard menus are great and the interior has plenty of seating as well as the porch. Lots of awesome lighting and great table space.  When I walked in, my friend had already ordered and was sitting on the patio. Before ordering mine, I tried her mocha. It was horrible. Ugh I don't know how they could make it taste this bad...It didn't taste of espresso, there was absolutely no chocolate to speak of in the drink (unless it was sitting at the bottom because the barista didn't stir it), and it wasn't really all that hot. As a fellow barista, I will say that the milk was steamed wonderfully.  So anyway, I opted not to order my favorite coffee concoction and instead ordered the Honey Nut Latte I'm told is similar to my Honey Bee Latte. It was ok. Very easy on the flavoring but there was enough flavor to make it palatable.  Overall, if you prefer the taste of espresso or even slightly sweet drinks...this place isn't for you.

Thunderbird Coffee ," 1/23/2015 My friend and I were looking a great coffee shop to have some coffee and digest our dinner food babies. What a pleasant surprise this was.  Drinks: I ordered the Honey-nut Latte, while my friend ordered the Chai Tea. The latter was simply alright. I am not a fan of chai tea, so take my opinion on the tea with at least 10 grains of salt. It was definitely not unbearable, but it is also most definitely not the reason I gave this place 5 stars. My Honey-nut Latte was really really good. Not too sweet, but also a good amount of flavoring that made the drink ideal for a great coffee. Order the Honey-nut Latte when you go.  Service: The cashier was very nice and patient while we were discussing our drink choices. She made the coffees right away.  Environment: This place gave me the impression that I was truly in Austin when I walked in. The coffee shop layout was very open with lots of space. The walls all had stuff on them, while a lot of the furniture was wooden. The interior designing of the place had a very Austin-y vibe (for lack of a better word). One thing I really liked about this place were the quotes scribbled on little pieces of paper that were taped to the table. As messy as that sounds, it actually contributed to the overall vibe, while also providing my friend a very intriguing topic of conversation. The quote on our table was ""Friendship is always a sweet responsibility, never an opportunity"" and since I was there with a friend, it was a great conversation starter.  Thunderbird Coffee is perfect for a great conversation over coffee. I paid $8.60 for two drinks. It's on the pricier side, but add in the wonderful environment, and you got yourself a deal. ", pos 
Thunderbird Coffee ," 10/1/2015 Great spot to stop in and grab a cup of coffee! I was visiting from out of town, but I'll make a point to stop back in next time I'm in Austin.

Thunderbird Coffee ," 1/22/2014 5 check-ins The best thing about this place is the people-watching. Thunderbird attracts the best people. It's what makes this place uniquely fun and lovable. The people that come here give Thunderbird an earthy, genuine vibe. Nobody hides their tattoos. Nobody whispers when discussing intensely personal matters. Nobody casts you a wild eye because you wearing a sleeveless tuxedo shirt. People feel welcomed here, and it gives Thunderbird a certain charm.  You see every type of person here, and every person brings something interesting to the table. Musicians, bicyclists, students, yuppies, and sometimes parents and their kids. People even bring their dogs to sit outside (they have great outdoor seating). This place is a more genuine Austin locale than anywhere I've been.  Not only does it have a great atmosphere, but they've got what you need. They have a surprising amount of variety on their menu. The drinks are great. I love getting tea here, actually. I'm no coffee or tea snob, but I can say I haven't had a drink I didn't enjoy. The sandwiches rock--I always get the Chicken Chipotle sandwich. It has a nice little kick to it. Also, you know what this place does differently? They actually give you a complete meal. The sandwich comes out hot, and the side salad actually has fresh vegetables and a decent dressing. I've been to a bunch of coffee shops and gotten food when I could, and this place actually satisfies me.  And so I keep coming back. You might too. ", pos

Every time I've come for a cup of coffee, the barrista and anyone else behind the counter talks to me and we always have funny conversations that really start my day off right.  The music is usually really good here, the outdoor patio space it awesome and a great place to people watch, and the coffee is solid.  There are tons of options for coffee on the east side. Thunderbird is a perfect spot with plenty of room to do a little work, or maybe meet that Saturday Morning Caffeine Cruise group! ", pos 
Thunderbird Coffee ," 3/17/2015 My wife loves the Honey Nut Latte here. I had a large iced latte and it honestly didn't taste much different in terms of flavor from a Starbucks iced latte. The food is pretty good here but the prices for the coffees are high considering the available sizes.  This is a total hipster hangout, which is not my scene and there is not much in the way of parking (most people come here on bike). Saying that I still think they make a pretty welcoming environment here and no complaints about the baristas. ", pos

Thunderbird Coffee ," 7/29/2015 Spot ON Always. The baristas are always well informed, cool and collected.  Great Espresso (rotating), and the Honey Nut Latte is perfect.  Love the water right next to the bar (always hydrate before caffeine). Really the only downside I can think of is parking (which has only been an issue twice) and the volume of people (I am always able to work for at least two hours undisturbed).  I havent even mentioned the beer menu. ", pos 
Thunderbird Coffee ," 10/13/2013 Daylight! Windows! Why are these so hard to find in Austin coffee shops?  Basically, I come to this Thunderbird location because of all the windows. It's nice to work and still feel connected to the passing of the sun and other general weather patterns. A man cave I do not want.  But beyond the windows, Thunderbird has good coffee, friendly baristas who actually want to talk to you about stuff, and respectful customers. They serve beer here in addition to coffee, so you get a mix of people hanging out, generally outside on the picnic benches, and people working on computers. It's a pretty chill vibe, so I've never been bothered by loud drunkards or louder study groups.  For the moment, this is my favorite coffee shop in Austin. ", pos

Thunderbird Coffee ," 12/4/2014 I arrived at around 6PM on a Thursday and it was pretty crowded. I'm not sure how generally busy this place gets but finding parking was awful and confusing (granted it was heavy traffic hour).  The atmosphere is not much different from Bennu Coffee. Lots of college students on their laptops. Music a little bit too loud. If you're looking for a quiet little nook to study or do work, I would not suggest coming here. This place has a friendly, upbeat atmosphere and the staff was very nice. Good place to hang out, people watch, and chat with friends if you like a lively vibe. There's plenty of seating if you include the spots outside, but since the weather is getting a bit chilly and yucky I doubt a lot of people would want to sit outside. Otherwise, I can imagine indoors feeling rather cozy or cramped depending on how many people are here.  I will definitely be back, though, for their super delicious Honey-nut latte if nothing else!

Thunderbird Coffee ," 5/19/2015 Good coffee. Most of the staff was cool too but there are these 2 guys in their early 20s that you can tell are good friends because they dress EXACTLY the same. They were dressed like hipsters. They both had these hats on w/ their hair coming out the bottom of the hat in a pretentious way. Here's the thing, I don't give a crap about ppl and how they dress but a store's employees are a statement of the store and though the owner encouraging independence is cool, there has to be a cutoff because these two banal trendy wannabe scene hipsters (WHO WANTS TO BE A HIPSTER?!) are giving this great coffee place a reputation that is unprofessional. You can still be considered ""laid back"" and be professional. But my coffee baristas wearing beanies in Texas says LAME. But their benevolence makes up for the mtv poser look. Maybe I'm being a bit hard on them but trust me, older people looking to work on their computers and get coffee don't wanna see these young hipster uniformed kids. They should distinguish the place by being different. ", pos 
Thunderbird Coffee ," 4/9/2013 28 check-ins Listed in Caffeine Boost Thunderbird's a nice shop. It has a bright and warm interior due to the (mostly natural) lighting with sleek and simple furniture. From my experience, the noise level's just right, both in music and in others conversing. The coffee's good, and they're one of the few in Austin providing Cuvee. I will say that the pretentious level is a bit higher here than other shops, but don't get too turned off by that.  The biggest problem with Thunderbird is the seating and parking. When this place is busy, it's nearly impossible to find a seat. There's a good amount of spots at the bar, but when those are gone, you're done, especially if you're in need of an outlet. I don't mind sitting outside, but Thunderbird is NOT the place to come if the weather isn't accommodating.  Otherwise, Thunderbird's a solid choice for both caffeine and studying. The simple, warm atmosphere provides a conducive environment to get things done. ", pos 
Thunderbird Coffee ," 3/22/2015 1 check-in I had the honey nut latte, which I was excited for given previous reviews but I was disappointed by it. It's SICKLY sweet, like not possible to finish it. And pretty expensive for the size they give you. My boyfriend ordered the cappuccino and thought it was decent, nothing outstanding. I guess the true test of whether the coffee is good is to just get black coffee/ espresso next time we come here. 3 stars for atmosphere. They have a lot of outdoor seating which is nice on sunny days. BEWARE don't park at the parking lot next to it. You have to find street parking. ", neutral

It's definitely not one of those dark, computer-filled, cords everywhere, students gloomily studying, and moody coffee shops.  I went on a saturday afternoon to get some reading done and was able to find a comfy chair quite easily.  During my 2 hours there, there was always some sitting available.  There's also the perfect amount of noise level.  Pleasant music in the background and just enough people talking, that you don't feel like you're disturbing anyone else if you're having a conversation, but also not so quiet that you feel like you're sharing your life with the entire coffee shop!

Thunderbird Coffee ," 3/16/2014 1 check-in Really liked this place -- definitely see myself coming back again. I'm not a coffee connoisseur or anything, but their cappuccino is the best I've had in a while. I love that they have multiple entrances, along with gigantic windows. Good place to spend all day at without bearing the guilt that you're wasting away the free sunlight! Their windows make it possible to be productive and enjoy a pretty day when it's not possible to sit outside. They've got a decent sized patio space--which I'm quite excited about come April or the early summertime.  The service was quick, and the staff seems to be active in keeping the place clean which is a plus! They seemed very friendly and welcoming so no complaints there.  Parking wasn't bad at all. The guy before me took the last spot in their lot so I resorted to street parking but it didn't take long. Was able to find a really good spot in no time.  Now, for the two reasons that knocked off the fifth star that I would've given them:  1) the music was really loud at times (most of the time). I was there to converse and it was really hard to hear myself, let alone my company.  2) at 7pm on a Sunday, there was limited seatings. I wish they would add a few more tables or chairs. Plus, I think I witnessed a lighter than usual crowd since it is the Sunday before spring break ends.  This was my first non-Starbucks coffee house visit in Austin. I'll be exploring other locations and will be comparing them to this. So far, I like Thunderbird a lot cause I don't feel the heavy presence of the elitist hipster culture here. ", pos 
Thunderbird Coffee ," 2/28/2015 This is actually my favorite coffee shop. So, about the drinks...the honey nut latte is my favorite for when I want something sweet. They make a good iced toddy as well. Their chai is delicious, too. I eat here a lot, because I study here all the time. My favorite things are the greek salad, hummus & grilled pita, and the turkey cran sandwich. They're all yummy. Now, the baristas. I have so much love for so many of them. They're friendly, helpful, not pretentious, and accommodating. They choose the music that is played, which is really nice because I don't get sick of the music like I do at most cafes. It's homey, and I can almost always find a table inside. When the weather's nice, I sit outside with our puppy, drink an ICED honey nut latte (seriously, so good), and just get work done. The place is conducive to both studying and conversation. Oh, and check out the quotes written on each table. I have one specific quote that I LOVE. AND they have $1 mimosas on Saturdays...AND I found a new beer I like (I'm very picky) because it was on draft, so that's cool, too.  I do wish that it were open until later, because I could easily see myself staying here for an even longer haul of studying. ", pos

The atmosphere is a great place for a date as it has a very cozy and intimate vibe. They also gave a good amount of marshmallows for the two of us. The smores were good- however, nothing too special, just the average roast it yourself by the fire with chocolate and graham crackers. Because it was generic, the price could be a bit lower for this treat on the menu (we paid $7- the price of many entrees around Austin). I assume you are paying for the experience. My cravings were, on the other hand, satisfied.  This place is great to visit occasionally- especially late at night because they offer lots of alcoholic drinks, coffee, and snacks.

Short line but plenty of tables available.  Two people working the counter so patiently waited my turn.  Female behind the counter was pretty surly.  She was taking orders, serving at the counter, so chalk it up to maybe just a busy morning.  When it was my turn no eye contact just a ""what do you want to order"".  Okay.. there for the coffee not to make a new friend.  Ordered a coconut milk latte, paid, tipped, and walked over to wait.    The latte was perfection and the guy making it smiled and told me to enjoy.  Went outside and sat at the railing to drink my coffee and enjoy the city morning noise  Lots of people watching.  Didn't order food but they had the typical ATX breakfast menu.  Have to say the coffee warrants another trip back to give it another shot and also keep the review from being a 2 star.  With all the choices for coffee in the area, good coffee is helped by friendly service.  Just a tip. ", neutral

Pleased to report that my love of this place was not tainted by the rose colored glasses of my former relationship.  Yes, seating here is going to suck. It's hit or miss when you come in. But on nights where you need to stay up late cranking in work and in order to not fall asleep doing so---you need commotion, possibly a loud band and a decent hustle and bustle around you----Halcyon is the right place. I love that you can roast marshmallows here. I love during the right season there's like 10 different spiked hot chocolates to choose from, and I love that you have your choice of coffee or spirits.

The french toast isn't your traditional french toast, it's actually pretty dense...more like a bread pudding construction.

I know Hershey's are original, but the choice would have been nice. ", pos 
Halcyon ," 4/21/2016 Pretty neat spot for late night coffee/beer/dessert downtown. I came on a Monday night and they were still hopping in the late night at around 11pm. It was world music night and about 10 different people came to jam out on an array of different instruments, playing music from India, the Middle East, Spain, etc. Everyone together. They were great and people in the audience started dancing. Totally unexpected and totally an element of why Austin is so amazing to create spaces for this to happen and in such unexpected places.  Had a great time. Nice folks at the bar. ", pos 
Halcyon ," 6/9/2016 This spot is literally perfection - smack dab in otherwise dirty downtown. A modern interior with tons of intimate couch seating, or traditional bar type seating if you prefer. This place is the perfect pitstop. We arrived here on Friday night and ordered drinks and 'smores. I love the coffee meets dessert meets drinks aspect here, it's refreshing compared to the rest of the dirty 6.  The only thing that's a bit gross is the fact that their restaurant is open to the public and we saw the most random people walk in and use their bathroom which kinda marred the vibe a bit.  Otherwise, I love everything about this place - I'm sure it makes for the perfect daytime brunch and coffee spot as well! A must-visit if you're in Austin! ", pos 
Halcyon ," 9/10/2015 1 check-in Vibe is chill. Bartender is cool but for the price of the drinks I expected more with a lot better flavor and more diverse choices.  Bee's Knees wasn't on the menu but was made for me anyway. Okay. Bartender added quite a bit of gin which of course is pretty dry so even the honey couldn't sweeten it up by much.  Lemon Rhubarb was basically just sparkling lemon with a touch of alcohol. Where was my rhubarb? They looked oh, so very pretty but looks were kind of deceiving.  Thin mint is good but the person I was with that indulged in it said it sickened them after just a few slurps.  Hot chocolate was pretty bitter and really just could have used more sugar. It's hot chocolate, my friends. I'm trying to indulge, not be healthy!  Pretty cool that they have a cigarette bar inside to make purchases from and I love the idea of a coffee shop, food, and a bar combined but I'll stick with just getting the food and non alcoholic beverages (skipping the hot chocolate) next time I'm in here. Hot chocolate - not the best I've had but not horrible. Thin Mint. Chocolate rim with a mint alcoholic milkshake. Good but way too sweet after the first few drinks. Bee's Knees- off the menu; honey, lemon, gin. See all photos from Hannah H. for Halcyon ", neutral 
Halcyon ," 3/9/2016 1 check-in What a cute place!  I heard so many good things about their s'mores, and I was in such a s'mores kick so I had to try it out.  I can't say it worked perfectly, and made my marshmallows nice and crisp and gooey on the inside, but It tasted fine!    Their coffee is also very delicious.  I love Austin coffee anyways.  Their beans are so aromatically wonderful.  Great place to go to with a group, or even alone! ", pos

My barista was actually from the same town I am, which was absolutely insane to me because it's over 500 miles away! This coffee shop is in a great location and not too far from anything! I ordered an iced latte and my husband got a chocolate frappe and both were excellent! Halcyon has a full bar, so you can add a shot to any drink you purchase. The ambience is awesome, and there is a ton of comfy seating. Their art is mostly from local artists and right now they have huge glitter paintings of celebrities and I almost emptied out my savings account for one of them, but you can't exactly fit a 40x50 canvas in a carry-on bag.

Halcyon ," 2/2/2016 Listed in Austin Coffeshop Bucket List This is my go to when I am late night raving on 4th.  It can be a bit packed, the baristas a bit pretentious, and the wait time a bit too long...but you are in downtown ATX, kiddo and you gotta learn that this is the norm somewhere so it might as well be where they have ""DIY s'mores"" and killer Thai Iced Tea (w/a shot of espresso, it is DIVINE!) and is one of the better ""after all the bars close"" people watching perches!

Halcyon ," 2/2/2016 1 check-in A date night place if I've ever seen one before. It had a distinct hipster-y vibe and it's probably a place you'd expect to see in Austin. The guy we were getting advice from at Berry Austin suggested that we come here for ""the best hot chocolate and s'mores in town"". Since we were pretty much done with alcohol at this point, we stopped in for a bit.  It's pretty cute and I think the s'mores are a unique and excellent idea. Basically they bring a lighter, light it for you, and you roast your s'mores over a little fire. Yum! I haven't had s'mores in a long time. There's only enough for about two of them a piece, so make sure you savor every bite!  I ordered the peanut butter hot chocolate. I thought it was okay, but the peanut butter was being overruled by the chocolate and the hot temperature from the drink. Note to self: peanut butter in a hot drink doesn't seem to mix very well with its contents. I tried scooping the peanut butter out with my straw and almost gagged on the remnants of the peanut butter. Bleghh.  Well, that minor detail aside, I would recommend taking your bae here and showing her how manly you are by not starting your marshmellow on fire. ", pos 
Halcyon , 9/18/2016 1 check-in Very nice a clean setup. Food was very good for a light breakfast. The French toast was just as good as mother made. Great morning breakfast in Texas. , pos 
Halcyon ," 1/22/2016 Halcyon is a really nice place if you're looking for an edgier place to chill with some friends on a late night for coffee or dessert.  It's most known for the smore's - they give you a small fire, graham crackers, chocolate, and marshmallows to roast yourself right there in the cafe. I'm not a huge fan of smore's, and it is a  bit pricey here, but I do like the environment here, and the fact that it's open quite late.  The chocolate cake is really decadent, so if that's what you like, I recommend trying it! I haven't had much of their other food, but they offer a lot of snacks. Unfortunately, they don't serve food after around 11 PM, I believe.  For people just visiting Austin, I think there are better places to get dessert, coffee, and alcohol, so Halcyon isn't one of my favorite places to go. But if you're already downtown, or live in Austin, definitely check it out. ", pos

What really makes Halcyon great though is their wonderful staff. Just a great bunch of people that are super friendly and make everyone feel welcome. Caffeine junkies should ask for the Quad Latte. Also, the breakfast tacos are fantastic. Excellent place to day drink as well for those so inclined.  Great place for tourists to get their bearings on a visit since you're in the warehouse district and close to Congress and Sixth. My personal favorite of the many downtown coffee shops. ", pos

Halcyon ," 11/5/2015 3 check-ins The Good: This place is pretty consistent in everything it offers. Good coffee, vibe, people, service, etc. It's not you're usual coffee shop. On any given night you can find live music, smoke hookah or roast some marshmallows and make s'mores.  The Bad: as in most dt locations if you're looking for a work-place or a stop-and-go coffee this is not a easy place to stop at, unless you live downtown. Parking around this area is not easy, but not impossible. ", pos 
Halcyon ," 11/3/2015 I've only been to Halcyon a few times in the company of friends who knew some of the bartenders/baristas. Based on those experiences, service and the price of our cocktails was quite reasonable. Absurdly reasonable.  Nepotism aside, I really enjoy the environment at Halcyon and the enormous selection of drinks they offer. It's hard to beat sitting outside on a pleasant fall day and people watching. I've never gotten the S'Mores before, but it definitely looks like quite a fun thing to do and would be perfect for a date. ", pos

Although the espresso martini was tempting me.  The soy latte was very nice. My husband had the pour over coffee which was very good!  For lunch, I had the walnut apple salad. It was the perfect size and very nice. My husband had the Elvis - a PBJ with bacon, banana and honey. They classify this as a ""snack"", but it certainly can be had for lunch. He would have licked his plate if I allowed him.  Halcyon is a cool place with a cool vibe - quintessential ""Austin"". I need to come back and try one of these espresso drinks. A soy vanilla latte The apple walnut salad - very yummy! See all photos from Suann G. for Halcyon ", pos

I ordered the turkey Brie sandwhich. The salad was good, the greens were very fresh. The sandwich was good...but not great. I am a huge Brie fan and I couldn't even taste it. But for a lunch sandwich, it was good. Make sure you have time to wait though, it was about 20 minutes!!!! The place was extremely busy starting around noon.

They bring you the s'mores kit which is the marshmallows, hershey bars, and graham crackers and a mini fire stove so you can roast your own marshmallows! The atmosphere is super chill. I've been when they've had a live musician. It isn't too loud which is good because you can actually talk to who you're with. They have couches and tables and tallboys. It's across from all the gay bars and next door to Cedar Street Courtyard which are both fun spots to check out after you enjoy your s'mores. ", pos 
Halcyon , 8/24/2015 Not sure why I made such a big mistake by not ordering the s'mores but I think I need to come back and try it.  Came here to meet up with a friend on a Saturday afternoon and it was decently packed but nothing to crazy.  I ordered the Iced Latte and sat down for a couple hours to do some work.  The wifi was nothing to crazy but it did the job.  The overall environment in Halcyon was really nice.  Not too loud but not library silent.

Whether it's during the day or at night post-club/post-bar, this place never disappoints.  The s'mores and drinks are amazing here. I highly recommend you try the espresso martini - one of my favorite alcoholic drinks in Austin! I've also had the Nutella crepe, which was absolutely delectable. I honestly don't think you could go wrong with many of the items on the menu here.  It may seem a little small here, but there's actually a plethora of seating options available. Of course if you come at night, especially during the weekend, it may be a tad difficult to find seating. Fortunately, there's also seating outdoors. S'mores and espresso martinis. ", pos 
Halcyon ," 10/2/2015 The wife and I stopped in late night after dinner. I needed a little caffeine before the drive back to our hotel. We stumbled upon Halcyon and it had a great vibe going on. We lucked out and got a little corner area to sit and take in all the action as we had a view of the whole place. Now this review is mainly for the cold brew coffee and the coconut tea that the wife got, as well as the service provided. All was excellent and we really enjoyed the relaxed atmosphere.  It seems like they have some type of s'mores dessert that was clearly popular as we saw it on more than a few tables. I'm sure that they have some other food options, but we really didn't take a look at the menu other than for coffees and teas. We would definitely return and hang out at Halcyon whenever we find ourselves in downtown Austin. ", pos

Iced coffee was a good - not too bitter, just the way I like it. We also got the Migas breakfast tacos with avocado cream. They were really good, but beware the red salsa - it is extremely spicy. Also enjoyed the overnight French toast. Service was friendly and the place was very quiet and peaceful on a Sunday morning. ", pos 
Halcyon ," 3/3/2015 1 check-in Listed in Pretending to Hook 'Em The way I would describe this place is a Michael Buble song laced with a couple shots of whiskey. All in all, I had a hard time deciding between 4 and 5 stars. Let's be conservative and stick with 4 for now.  AMBIENCE Ohmygosh so romantic!! Red-orange lighting, live music (modified string ensemble with drum and guitar), colorful bejeweled portraits of famous people on the walls (Audrey Hepburn, Lady Day, Snoop Dogg just to name a few), varied seating in and outdoors, stools and couches, and a bar! Very cozy and intimate.  FOOD & DRANK Did I say intimate? How about s'mores for 2? At your table? Honestly this is probably just a thing for first-timers to order but it is still a really adorable and creative concept. My cappuccino came in a giant cozy mug. My friend's latte came in a yellow one! The color was adorable! Milk foam on mine could have been stiffer but the overall taste of the drink was strong and smooth.  SERVICE The baristas were wonderful, fabulous, friendly, and so easy to talk to I honestly didn't know how to go about interacting with them LOL. They addressed me by name and all that jazz.  Overall, I highly recommend this place for even though it is busy, it still creates an intimate atmosphere for whoever you choose to come with. Open late into the night, conducive to deep talks and cute dates. A cafe, with a bit of spice from the bar. S'mores for three! With an americano and peppermint latte in the background ", pos 
Halcyon , 8/21/2015 I had the cosmonaut and it was pretty darn good! The vibe is chill and their music playlist was bomb(in a good way).

Halcyon ," 9/11/2015 OVERALL: great place for a quick bite for dessert on a date!  AMBIENCE: perfect little place to go for a date with mild lighting and couches for you to sit. These couches have very comfortable pillows to make you feel like you're in your own home. There are some corners with couches that give you a lot of privacy also. Sometimes have live music playing which is quaint but not overpowering of the night to where it's all you can hear.  TASTE: we had the smores for 2 people which was about $7. It was your basic Hershey's bar, marshmallows and graham crackers that you could put together from any supermarket but it comes with a small flame to make everything yourself which is cute to share :)  SERVICE: No really waitress, but pay at the counter and they bring it to you. They don't really check up on you until you are on your way out. Staff is nice though! Basic smores for 2 with moist towelettes for the mess! Date night with the private corner of pillows!

Halcyon ," 7/24/2015 Really needed some coffee around midnight since we flew in on a Friday and were tired from the traveling.  We were really surprised how there was a cafe right in the middle of downtown where the party was happening!  Got an iced latte and it was good.  Very nice espresso with whole milk.  Tried a bit of the soy chai latte and typically I'm not a huge chai fan, but it was some tasty brew!  Didn't try the food, but plenty of people had drinks from the bar also on a Friday night.  The atmosphere is definitely on the cool side.  Outdoor area is great for people watching. ", pos

They have eight different kinds of hot Toddy's!  Eight!  The Buttery Rum is absolutely delicious.  A friend ordered coffee with Bailey's and was happy as a clam.

Halcyon ," 1/7/2015 1 check-in The two things I ordered at Halcyon both involved chocolate.  1) S'mores This is an ingenious idea that I wish more coffee shops did. It was freezing (for Austin) standards and I had a lot of fun torching marshmallows (and watching my girlfriend light a few on fire) before squashing them in between some Graham crackers and chocolate. Love it.  2) Some sort of chocolate martini thing. I don't really know what it was because I was drunk, but it sure was yummy when I had it! You should be able to figure it out when you get there.  Really cool building interior, but definitely not enough seats for its location downtown. You seat yourself, and I think most people have enough sense to leave after they're done with their coffee or whatever they're having. There aren't many electrical outlets handy, so that certainly helps keep the stereotypical buy-one-coffee-and-stay-all-day-on-your-laptop customers away.

Halcyon ," 8/6/2015 This is a great breakfast place! I got a Lox bagel and a Thai iced coffee, and they were both delicious. The bagel came out unassembled, and I am always a little confused when a breakfast sandwich comes out like this. I really liked this one though. The presentation with the lox was really pretty, and it made it seem like I was having a really fancy breakfast at this low key joint. The sandwich itself tasted really fresh even for this New England girl. The coffee packed just the right punch of caffeine, coffee flavor, and sweetness. I had initially asked for a French Press (apparently I only like country based coffee beverages), and they don't actually offer that anymore. Since I ordered that and couldn't get it, the barista actually took $4 off of my bill. So my coffee was almost free! I didn't expect it, and it definitely got my morning off to a good start.  The actual place has a cool vibe with exposed beams and brick walls, local artists work for sale on the walls, brightly colored accents everywhere, and classic bluesy tunes playing in the background. They have great places for working, but they also have cozy places to curl up with a book or even hang with friends. They also have a full bar for the evenings, and I can only imagine this place heats up at night. The baristas are super friendly and helpful (see above), and the wifi is free! As a business traveler, it was nice to get on quickly without having to login or see any ads. This was definitely a plus.

The employee taking our order wasn't pleasant and had a very fast paced attitude. We went with the s'mores for two, a mudslide, and a cappuccino.  The cappuccino was excellent and went perfectly with our s'more feast and my friend's mudslide was tasty but after one sip I was ready to take on 6th street! The s'mores were a blast, we had fun shaking off the flames from the mallows and acting normal when they went flying onto nearby hipster messenger bags/or backs(tee hee).

Halcyon ," 11/14/2015 Three of my favorite things in life: coffee, cocktails, and dessert. Great location too. Visited a few times so far, first time had lunch, other times had drinks, coffee, and s'mores on the last date. Only comes with one or two servings so would have been down for a double order. Because of the night time buzz people seem very social even in the day time for a cafe when you want to just be working with wifi. Not the silent-whisper to your friend kind of cafe. Good times.

Halcyon ," 7/2/2016 1 check-in Good place for coffee. Espresso was a bit watered down, though their La Marzocco machine is nice and I suspect it was just a poorly dialed in shot (but they obliged to give me a pull of a single origin). Iced toddy brew and cappuccino were solid. Good seating inside and out. ", pos 
Halcyon ," 4/16/2015 Updated review 2 check-ins Went here one night with my little sis to catch up since I moved to Houston, and what a great place to do so! We had both ordered an alcoholic drink that was somehow mixed with coffee (Irish coffee?) feeling a little adventurous and the cool and totally hipster s'mores snack/meal/thing. The s'mores came with I believe about four items of each of the essential components for s'mores, but at one point of the night, we underestimated how much cracker to use and had to ask for extra crackers. The cashier up front simply smiled and gave us a couple more with no charge, which was pretty nice of him since a line had begun to form outside of the building. The atmosphere is really chill. A nice cafe to go to when you don't wanna be dealing with 6th street drunkards. I do gotta say though claim your seats swiftly and quickly! Dem seats are in demand. ", pos 
Halcyon , 5/25/2015 Not as good as I remembered. We ordered Carmel hot cocoa and a peanut butter hot chocolate. Added baileys to each but just wasn't like I remembered the last time I was here.  I do recommend the smores. They are fun on a late night and so yummy!  The place is always packed even late with a very fun and eclectic crowd. We made a special stop since its one of my Austin favorites. It just didn't meet my expectations this time. , neutral 
Halcyon ," 9/23/2015 1 check-in A very relaxing cool atmosphere. My bestfriend who visits Austin often comes here during the day to get coffee and do her art. She loves this place and told us to come by!  I ordered what my friend usually gets which is a hazelnut frappaccino. It was so delicious not too sweet and had so much flavor! It is a bit on the really creamy side especially when you're down to the bottom of the frap it gets really foamy but eh, I don't mind that!  I love the atmosphere of this place, everyone seems to be to themselves but very friendly. A great place to study not too loud and pretty relaxing music. It's way better than Starbucks and if you're visiting in town like me I would definitely suggest this coffee place as a must stop by! ", pos

Halcyon ," 5/20/2015 I love chocolate. I also love ice cream. And tea. And hot chocolate. Obviously, I love s'mores.    I am not a huge fan of alcohol. So a place that can combine the two successfully is so appealing to me. Either way, Halcyon is a FANTASTIC place to go to for just regular hot chocolate. Seriously, they have 4 different types of hot chocolate. Heavily on the chocolate (French Hot Chocolate), so delicious.. The other hot chocolate type that I tried is the Bittersweet caramel. I really love caramel, and it's this is a little salty and just fantastic.  Of course I'm going to talk about the s'mores. The s'mores are great -- they give you a little fire and you can melt the marshmellows and it's like you're at camp again! Except you're inside, there's no mosquitos and you're surrounded by comfy pillows.  If you are looking for a sweet intimate date -- Halcyon is the best place I can think about. The seating is sectioned off, there's pillows everywhere... ", pos 
Halcyon ," 9/14/2014 1 check-in I've been here multiple times, and I normally would give it five stars, except that parking is always insane, because this is on the corner of such a busy area!  Their food is great, and the drinks to me are just okay. What makes this place so cool is the atmosphere and the type of people that frequent here. You get a mix of your normal coffee drinkers with those that like to drink and have a good time, and you get a great mix of people all at once.    The service is always very attentive to your needs. Yesterday, I ordered a Thai tea, and I saw one, and thought it was mine so I took it.  The kind bartender told me that it was actually someone's previous drink that they forgot to pick up, but he gave me the option of getting a new one. And when they ran out of the Thai tea, he offered me a special drink which happened to be a very tasteful iced chai tea latte.  So, I always give special props and good reviews to those that have great service! The menu ", pos 
Halcyon ," 5/28/2015 If you have time to spare, Halcyon is a great spot to start off or finish your night downtown. Love the location and the fact that it's clearly marked and visible. The iced latte I had was fine, but nothing special. However, the green tea frappe was spectacular! Chocolate peanut butter frappe was nice without feeling too heavy.The hibiscus tea is good too, if you don't mind paying almost $3 for iced tea.  I agree that the s'mores are probably a first-timer gimmick, but they're so fun. And so cute. And such a perfect date idea. Service can be pretty-to-really slow, so go if you have time to spare and hang around. Note that the designated coffee pick up area is not clearly marked and is practically at the bar, which is confusing.  The pomegranate margarita was fine - strong enough, but nothing I'd come back for. Mainly, I bought it to try out the bar/coffeeshop environment.  Atmosphere is cool - almost too cool. The couches add a cozy feel and I like when there's a good amount of people in there. Overall a fun spot to stop if you're downtown! ", neutral

Halcyon ," 1/7/2016 6 check-ins Used to come here frequently in the summer to read and hang out while waiting for my bf to get off of work downtown. Definitely a cool place to chill if you can find the space. Seating is pretty limited and the place is normally filled with other people working. (which is probably a good sign otherwise) Always a lot of cool art on the walls. I normally would order the hazelnut frappe but have tried the different iced teas, thai iced tea and have gotten a salmon salad that was one of their specials and have tried other things off their menu. Food is always pretty good and the prices are reasonable. I have yet to try drinks from the bar but in terms of my other drinks I've had slightly sloppy drinks made here and really really good ones depending on the barista. Tipping definitely will go a long way here.. ", pos

Every Friday I pick up breakfast tacos for my office as an end-of-week treat and when I found out Halcyon was starting to serve breakfast tacos, I had to try them for myself. DELICIOUS! My office had a taste test with various vendors in downtown and Halcyon won, hands down.  As an added bonus, everyone at Halcyon is friendly and goes out of their way to make sure I'm happy. Mari and Jules are especially great and always greet me with a smile, making me feel like I'm entering into a friend's kitchen.  If I could give more than five stars, I would! ", pos 
Halcyon ," 2/9/2015 Guys, I'm not gonna lie, I've hated on Halcyon for a while. It was kinda that place  where you'd go freshman and sophomore year of college when you wanted to go downtown, but couldn't actually go downtown (pre-21 lyfe). The first time I ever went, we celebrated a friend's birthday with the s'mores everyone is obsessed with. But you know, after doing s'mores the real way and having a real campfire, or even a gas stove for that matter, a small lantern ain't that impressive. Sorry, Halcyon.  Then, when a friend visited me junior year, we went to Halcyon, because even though I wasn't a fan of the s'mores, I do like me some coffee. Sadly, the coffee drinks were pretty sub-par and when Patika is a couple of blocks away, I'd rather opt for the real stuff. I remember we both got cafe au lait's and they were pretty meh - more milk than coffee and not even good coffee. I was really trying, Halcyon. At least you're still cute.  But apparently, it took me moving half way across the country for me to find Halcyon's sweet spot: cocktails. A friend I was visiting in Austin is obsessed with Halcyon. Seriously, OBSESSED. Thankfully, she admitted that the s'mores are unimpressive and the coffee isn't great, so I had renewed faith when she told me that the cocktails/beer/wine are pretty stellar. And she was damn right. Two cocktails almost took me to outer space (shout out to Dwight, the awesome bartender, and his awesome NASA cap). We had 4 cocktails in total, and naturally, I can only remember the name of one (Pine & Pear) - but ALL of them were amazing! You've redeemed yourself, Halcyon. ", pos

Halcyon ," 7/14/2014 1 check-in This shop is definitely not as good as the one in San Antonio but it'll do the trick.  Located downtown, this Halcyon is a lot smaller than the one in Southtown (SAT) but it does have more eclectic seating. The crowd looks quite the same; mostly early 20-something, more than likely college students.  The drinks are about the same although I found their chai to be a bit on the spicy side (not heat spicy just chai spicy). My wife just ordered tea so had they messed that up, well, things would have gotten nasty.  The one downer was the woman taking our order - the one with all the facial accoutrements that would make it impossible to pass through airport security. She was a bit on the sour-disposition side of things to say the least. I mean, when someone thanks you for something, how hard is it to say, ""you're welcome,"" or even just a ""no problem?""  One thing I noticed about this place is that they have make-them-yourself smores. You get a tray with a cast iron hibachi, a stack of graham crackers, 2 bars of Hershey's chocolates, marshmallows, and skewers. Too cool. Now maybe the Halcyon is Southtown has this but I've never seen nor asked. Unfortunately, my wife was not interested in making smores. Bummer!  Two other quick notes to pass along... Yes, they do have outdoor seating and yes, free WiFi. The latter is slower than a Lada heading down M58 in January. ", neutral

The Factory - Cafe With a Soul ," 11/30/2016 1 check-in Listed in Brunch Spots I loved the eclectic and homey plush decor and who doesn't want to swing and drink their coffee?  I would categorize this as a pricier coffee place but, to me it was worth it.  After Thanksgiving nobody wants to make brunch so we headed out in search of chicken and waffles.  There is ample parking in the private lot and  ordering is done through I-Pads.  Pick a seat and they will call your name when your items are ready.  Be patient because some of the coffee drinks take longer than others.  I had the cold brew coffee, chicken and waffles and we shared a pop+art!  The po+art was strawberry; light and fluffy on the outside and gooey sweet filling on the inside.  The chicken and waffles wasn't the standard so expect different, complex and interesting flavors from the accompanying slaw and sauce.  I thoroughly enjoyed it but, the waffle was a bit bland and maybe could have used a bit of honey to spruce it up.  The coffee here is spot on and I hear that their hot chocolate is the bomb but, I will have to wait for the weather to cool off to try that.

From their decor to their cups, everything was really cute. It's really the perfect place for a catching up with friends or a coffee date.  When you go order, there's really the least amount of interaction ever with the workers. You just pick your order on an iPad and they'll call your order out after for you to pick up at the counter. The whole thing's pretty novel honestly. I got the Viva Matcha Latte and it was so good! Perfect amount of sweetness and perfect temperature. I went on a cold night and this cafe is just so cozy, it was such a great combination. They have these swings as well which were pretty fun to sit on honestly.  Prices are what I would expect for a cafe like this, not super cheap, but not too pricey. There's no wifi here, so if you want to study, maybe this isn't the right place.

The Factory - Cafe With a Soul ," 10/27/2016 2 check-ins Listed in ""Nuptial Coffee Bliss!"", Anderson Lane is the new Black Oh hey, the pro vs con format. I've never used that before. Let's try it:  Pros: 1. This place is cooler than I thought. 2. It's open until 2am. No, really. 3. They have beer & wine. I didn't know that until I saw the beer taps. They offered me a sample.  Cons: 1. If you have to describe The Factory with one word, it probably won't be ""inexpensive.""  I don't think they're shooting for the ""Sixth Coffeehouse on Anderson Lane but with Flash"" title here, I think they really want to be the official bistro in the neighborhood - far more casual than Bartlett or Hopdoddy, but with a lot more flair than Tea Haus or Starbuck Evenings. Staying open until 2am is a good start, and let's see if they add more to the menu. Remember, no one thought that gentrified Walmart would do well either.  In the meantime, have fun with those chicken & waffles, and their colorful matcha-infused coffees. I'm only interested in straight black, and their pourover Stumptown is great stuff. Try the $5 pop tart at least once, mainly because you can. And then let's meet back here in a couple of weeks, just to see what's been tweaked. This place defines hipster man-cave.

I finally found a coffee shop I can study at without sacrificing comfort (Starbucks' uncomfortable chairs). The coffee shop endorses social connection, hence, wifi  isn't available. It makes me really happy that a lot of students hang out here with their book bags and laptops and we can all just study in peace and somehow quiet (the background music can get pretty loud). Unfortunately, there will always be that kid who's obnoxiously loud and would like the whole world to know her business. Seriously, unless it's something intriguing or educational, no one cares. In addition, as much ""fun"" as this place looks, it's not child friendly. So parents, make sure your children do not hit the table in front of it and knock out the chess set. Lastly, the sex images in the bathrooms are definitely not appropriate for children.  The ambiance is very much like Austin-- very eccentric and hip! Food and drink presentations are on par. Drink prices are reasonable and similar to good ole Starbucks. But unlike you're typical coffee shop, they have real food such as chicken and waffles.  My favorite about this place is the cleanliness. The employees do a good job maintaining the place. Also, as I watch them make coffees, they do it with fines as if they're creating some type of art, it's pretty cool (in my opinion).  In conclusion, Cafe w/ a Soul is probably the best coffee shop I've ever been to. It's like studying in my own home but away from distractions. I'm awake!

The Factory - Cafe With a Soul ," 10/25/2016 1 check-in Ok, let's try this approach...  Pros: Music Seating Decor General ambiance Service  Cons: iPad ordering (I'm a crotchety old man, kids) Limited coffee menu, or menu in general Relatively expensive Food is pretty but lackluster  I'm still sitting here as I type this and I'm less than overjoyed with the experience, sadly. The space and vibe are great but not quite familiar or intimate enough to beat out a place like Genuine Joe down the street. It seems like they bank on the vibe, and fall short the rest of the way. (This would be a great hangout for the artsy/design crowd having a collaborative meeting.)  The staff is great but the iPad ordering system limits your required interaction with them. They take pride in no wifi to increase interaction but then use iPads instead of people?  Seating is ample, if cramped in a surprisingly large space.  But the food, kids. So pretty, but again lackluster. I tried the Pop+art ($5) and the Nutella Waffle ($4.75) and they both sit on their respective tiny awkward plates half eaten. (Yes the plate liners are cute) The waffle is a great idea but the waffle itself  has no flavor and there's no delight. The tart is similar - the pastry crust is much too thick compared to the Smuckers jam tasting filling and it is essentially just pure sugar. The pastry itself doesn't even taste buttery or crisp. Meh. There appears to be no soul in this confectionary.  Coffee- passable. But at $4 for a cortado and a $1.50 up-charge for almond milk- I'll pick another place.  I get why the reviews are so good here, but there are much better places nearby for that ""cafe with a soul"" feel. This feels like an ACL pop-up. Going for that?  Great, come here.

The eclectic selection of tables, couches, and swings (?!) inside with a small kiddy corner appeal to many different types of tastes. This is seriously a cool place to hang out.  However, when it comes to the coffee and food, it's rather not cheap. The waffles range from $4-$8, and coffee is between $3.50 and $5. The quality of the coffee is not yet up to par with other coffee mainstays in Austin, so I would probably not choose to come here just for coffee.

I didn't want to tell anyone how awesome The Factory - Cafe With a Soul is because I don't want it overrun and super busy with no place to sit like so many other decent coffee shops in Austin. I happened to come in here with a friend mid-week and we sat here for several hours, enjoying the peace and quiet, the atmosphere, and the awesome coffee.  This place is a little eclectic - lots of peculiar art, books, games, knick-knacks, and an almost head-scratching drink and food menu. Waffles and pop tarts...and beer? And... coffee mojitos? Well, it works. Whatever is going on here, it works fabulously. They serve Stumptown Coffee, which as someone from the Northwest, I totally appreciate. They also brew coffee correctly. There is not a hint of bitterness or overcooked milk going on here. The iPad ordering screens are mostly cool, (although they need more options for customization) and the million different types of seating, (couches, pillows, swings, big chairs, little chairs, bar seating, regular tables) is both delightful and refreshing. The baristas make foam art - something that I have only seen at Houndstooth here in Austin.

The Factory - Cafe With a Soul ," 10/12/2016 1 check-in Checked out The Factory this past Sunday with my husband. We wanted to try their delicious looking waffles and were definitely not disappointed.  Husband ordered an iced coffee drink that was delicious, but it wasn't as good as my Golden Age of Milk Tea, well worth the 10 minute wait for the tea to steep.  We both ordered the Nutella Waffle and it was perfect. From the wood plate with the AMAZING paper liner printed with a famous person and an inspirational quote from them. I wanted just the paper because it was so cute and well done. The waffle is basically half a waffle, spread with Nutella and a layer of bananas, then folded in half. While small, it was a perfect amount, the bananas balancing out the sweetness of the Nutella. The waffle itself was crisp perfection, providing a crunch to the meal. The menu is very limited: there was the nutella waffle and a fried chicken waffle. I'm hoping they'll eventually serve other waffles, but totally respect their decision to start small.  The space is gorgeous. From the swings to the mural above the bar, everything looks meticulously planned out. And here is where my biggest advice comes: this place is really not for kids. The way the seating is set up is really for larger people and there is definitely no place for high chairs. While there is giant magnetic poetry on one of the columns, a crazy chair outside and a couple of table games, the giant chess set looks risky for grabby kids. If you have a well-behaved child who can handle it, I would think its fine. However, I watched several families come in and either leave or order to go, commenting it wasn't the best space for them. While this doesn't bother me (I love kidless spaces), it might be jarring to someone expecting to have brunch with the family.  I am so excited to become a regular here! Great new spot! ", pos

Perfect coffee companion. My husband and I will definitely be back, as we loved everything and felt it was all very reasonable priced. Olive oil cake, chicken & waffle and 15-minutes-of-fame coffee! So good. ", pos 
The Factory - Cafe With a Soul ," 10/25/2016 Tried this new cafe spot on Burnet with a friend - unassuming storefront, the decor is quaint af and you have to order from iPads at the counter and then choose a place to sit.  Not a brunch spot as we had thought, just a cafe with a couple of food options. The Nutella waffles we got were on point - there's also a chicken option.  The cold brew coffee was fantastic and my friend's milk tea turned out great too.  Good spot for conversations. Only knocking down a star for the limited options.

The Factory - Cafe With a Soul ," 11/23/2016 1 check-in My best friend and I came to The Factory after seeing it on a couple of best new Austin brunch lists. It's super cute and trendy, to the point where it feels kind of out of place in a strip mall. Although I loved the interior design and general ambiance of the place, I was a little disappointed with the menu. This is more of a coffee shop than a cafe - their food options are pretty limited. My friend ordered the chicken and waffles and I ordered Nutella waffles with strawberries and bananas. For the price I paid, the portions were definitely on the smaller side. I enjoyed my meal still, but it's hard to mess up Nutella and fruit, so I wasn't particularly impressed. I would love to come back to study sometime but since they don't have wifi, I don't think it'll be likely. ", neutral

The Factory - Cafe With a Soul ," 10/7/2016 1 check-in Came in on the first day of opening, hours currently 6am-2pm. At some point they'll stay open till 12 midnight. I think this might be the most beautiful cafe in Austin, the interior is charming, snazzy, cozy. There's even a pair of swings to sit on while you enjoy your coffee and play a game of chess. I ordered the Marymint Monroe, basically a mint mojito. It's been a while since I've been to Philz coffee so it's hard to compare, but I think the Marymint is a little creamier. Also had the banana nutella waffle, bananas and nutella are always a winning combination, can't go wrong there. No wifi yet but I'm sure it will come soon.

Cherrywood Coffeehouse ," 10/10/2016 2 check-ins Love it here! They have a ton of coffee options including a huge selection of flavors to add to your drink, pastries including a peanut butter cup that was delicious, and really good brunch food!  I ordered a sweet potato hash and it was the perfect amount of food and was fresh and filling. I love that you can choose to either sit outside or indoors, and that there is ample seating for either choice. Their outdoor tables are covered to protect you from the sun, and they occasionally have live music as well.  The coffee here was OK. Nothing great, but not bad. I only tried their drip and not their espresso but I'm not sure if I would come here just for coffee. Would definitely return for lunch or breakfast though.  One thing about brunch in Austin is that it usually means long waits, pricey food and minimal seating, but Cherrywood definitely restored my faith in brunch by serving me some really great food without these worries! Sweet potato hash. Delicious! ", pos 
Cherrywood Coffeehouse ," 10/10/2016 1 check-in Came here on a whim and I really wanted to like it, I really really did. It was relatively quiet for a cafe, they played music and although it was pretty full, there were lots of people alone and studying so I liked it! The wait was short and I sat at the bar because I wanted to take a break for about 30 minutes before going on with my day.  I ordered a chai tea latte and... It wasn't even mediocre. I barely tasted anything. I even asked for it with extra chai because I love the extra spicy taste, but it was so watered down! I don't know why I would pay $4 for warm milk.  I sat at the bar so when a barista showed up I asked how they make their chai to ask if they could add more but they only told me that it was a house tea and walked away..  I'll come back next time and try the food.. Hopefully it'll be a better experience/: ", neutral

Cherrywood Coffeehouse ," 7/24/2016 1 check-in What we ordered: 2 Shrimp & Grits ($9.95 each), 1 Iced Coffee, and 1 Iced Tea. Total bill is $28.XX. You order food & drink upon arrival at the register. Pick up the drinks right there & they will bring the food to your table when it's done.  Pricing: I would say the price for food is very reasonable. Only the drinks are a little pricey to my opinion.  Food quality: Shrimp & Grits would be an ideal & safe option if you don't know what to order. The dish is very flavorful & worth the price. The shrimp is fresh & they give you quite a good portion of the shrimp. The portion as a whole is just enough to fill you up full too.  Decor: I love everything about it. The inside area is very cute & modern with the lanterns. The outside patio is super cute & romantic. The spacing between each dining table gives just enough privacy for each party. The trees help a lot with the coverage to cool down the summer heat. I'm sitting here right now at 2 p.m. with 100 F degree but still don't feel like it at all. Just make sure you watch out for the bird's poop! (not sure how to do it though lol but just prepare your mind for such luck!) Shrimp & Grits! Soooo good. The other side of the outdoor patio.

Cherrywood Coffeehouse ," 9/10/2016 Like a bennu.. that unpolished runny hippy Austin vibe. I'm too old not to be picky. We came for a brunch date, and I thought it would be cool to have a meal and then hang around for a little to catch up.  The crawfish omelette was subpar, crawfish was so unappetizing, especially not in season. I think of Cherrywood and I cringe. Not because it was so un-delicious, but because I feel bad for the seemingly mom-and-pop and extended-family feel of the place, and that it just didn't bring anything special to the table. It wasn't for me, but there's enough on the menu for you to give it a try.  Service was prompt and professional. ", neutral 
Cherrywood Coffeehouse ," 5/7/2016 1 check-in We were at Home Depot talking about finding a coffee place that also serves food, and this place was recommended by an employee who lives in the neighborhood.  I love the history behind the place, and the food and drinks were pretty good!  I ordered the shrimp and grits, and the only flaw with the meal was that it was a little on the oily side. I'm pretty sure it was from the bits of bacon they threw in there,  so that was forgivable.  My hubby got their bacon, egg and cheese sandwich and he loved it.  We'll definitely be back!

Cherrywood Coffeehouse ," 3/31/2016 1 check-in Listed in Americano I've been meaning to try this place out and so sad I didn't come try any earlier! Cherrywood Coffeehouse isn't too far from west campus and there's so many seating available. They have a ton of food and drink selections (both bottled/ packaged and made in the bar).  Pros: +Their Iced Americano was one of the best I've ever had! The water to espresso ratio was spot on and not one of those super watered down coffee.  Cons: -Not every seat has outlets available so if you're here to study, I'd charge my laptop to full before coming! -There's a TV area and when I came by, a group of guys came to watch some dramatic show all together... Made a lot of noise. I'm glad I had brought earphones.  Atmosphere/ Location: The lighting is not too bright. Walking right in, I felt welcomed and greeted by the wonderful smell of the coffee beans. This location looks really scary and ghetto in the daylight but so pretty and fancy at night when the lights are lit!  Service: The guy behind the bar was very kind and friendly. My friend was interested in the packaged drinks and he seemed to be knowledgeable about the products they sell and even gave suggestions. Around their closing time, a girl worker came by and politely told us they're closing soon. I know so many coffee shops that just shut the music and the lights out by closing even when the customers are present so I was pleased with their respectful treatment! Iced Americano $2.50 ", pos

Cherrywood Coffeehouse ," 7/21/2016 1 check-in I came here to meet up with a few friends last night that I haven't seen in awhile! The menu has lots of options, including everything from signature sandwiches like the Muffuleta and Banh Mi to vegetarian-friendly fried tofu tacos. I ordered the Poblano Pork on corn taco plate, which comes with two tacos and a side of chips and salsa. However, with my dairy allergy, I ordered it sans the feta cheese that usually accompanies the order and let the cashier know I'm allergic. This place lost a star because even though I specified no feta, my food came out with cheese on top. When I ended up trying it, there was just so much shredded pork that was unfortunately just okay and not a lot of the poblano or onions advertised. The salsa had no kick and I was only given a tiny amount for all the chips I had, which was unfortunate. My friend really enjoyed his Veggie Grilled Cheese though!  My friends and I went outside to sit at one of the many picnic tables under a few Christmas light strings strewn above us just as someone was getting up to perform. While I appreciated the music, it was very hard to talk with my friends throughout the night as two other performers came up. We would've moved inside but it was incredibly silent as everyone seemed to be working or studying and we didn't want to disturb anyone.    I would come here for the atmosphere or to get work done, but I would maybe pass on the food and instead explore their coffee options. ", neutral

I usually walk here with my dog because they have a great patio area and plenty of doggy water bowls, you just have to grab water from the self-serve station inside. I also need help with my french fries and he's the best french fry wingman. This place is a little bit of a coffee house, bistro with great food and bar. I've tried most of their sandwiches and I must say I am a fan. My favorite are the Bahn mí and the Cuban sandwich. Both delicious. Can't get enough of their fries so they are a must with a meal. Their regular iced coffee is strong enough for when you don't feel like dishing out for coffee. Their cuban con leche is nice and strong and delicious. Have yet to try pastries, but I see a lot of others trying it. They have music playing outside and they also tend to do shows and events which is neat for the neighborhood.  You order at the counter. You get a number and wait for your drinks at counter 2. The food comes to you.  Great atmosphere. Great food. Great coffee. Have yet to try their beers, so I will update this down the line. Báhn mi.

But Cherrywood does get some stars for its atmosphere, food, and beer selection. This seems like just a fun place to hang out, especially outside under the ginormous trees. I saw a group doing yoga inside this morning. The drawing of ""dirty dishes"" is funny and awkward. There is just a nice bit of Austin weird, quirkiness going on here.  I got an egg sandwich with bacon and cheese on the sourdough this morning that was pretty tasty and huuuge. I'd say there was a solid 6 eggs on that thing, and the bread was nice and buttery, for under 5 bucks.All in all, if coffee isn't your top priority, there are many good reasons to hang out here!

I got it on corn so it was very messy and I had to eat a lot of it with a fork, but at least that forced me to slow down and savor this deliciousness! Also, it was huge. 1 was plenty. I also got an iced almond milk latte which was fine. Good enough to get again but not my favorite I've ever had, no big deal.

Cherrywood Coffeehouse ," 3/3/2016 One of the best coffee places in Austin.  Very chill atmosphere and sometimes they have good live music.  Parking is obviously difficult, but you can always street park a block or two away.  Breakfast and brunch are really good here.  The Cuban Con Leche with condensed milk is quite good (aka Vietnamese Coffee lol).  Outdoor seating when it's nice out is quite chill.  Just avoid sitting at the one lone table that's tucked away near the center of the yard. There's a King Joffrey of squirrels chilling on the tree branches up above that will crap on you or eat their nuts and spit it all over your food.  Bastard! ", pos 
Cherrywood Coffeehouse , 3/23/2016 1 check-in This place was disappointing as a breakfast spot. I didn't order the hearty meals but opted for a coffee and a cinnamon roll. The lady who took my order was so rude. She wanted to be anywhere but there. It was my first time and I wanted to inquire about the items in the pastry case and she basically did not want to answer. I got this cinnamon roll thing and it was so dry. It had probably been in the case for a while but you'd think they could heat it up or something. The coffee is pretty meh. Overall would probably not come back here. , neutral

Cherrywood Coffeehouse ," 8/19/2016 I love this place for so many reasons.  The food is good (especially for a coffee shop) for breakfast, lunch and dinner.  The breakfast sandwiches and a nap are a good cure-all for a Sunday hangover.    The space is nice and there's typically plenty of seats throughout the day.  They rotate art work there so there's always a little bit of a different feel every few months.    And most importantly, the staff and service are awesome. They're super friendly and I enjoy the vibe they create there. ", pos

Once I walked in it was very packed with people and seemed like a pretty hip little place. I was impressed that thy had a huge selection of beers on tap. I'm loving the whole coffee/beer house.  I've been trying it dirty chai lattes and some places just can't get it right. Sad to say, this was one of them :( I was so excited because it came in this nice fancy cup served alongside my everything bagel topped with sausage and egg.  The chai had to be one of the worst I've ever had. It had zero sweetness to it and was pretty undrinkable. I'm not one to complain so I just ate my sandwich and tried to drink it.  The bagel sandwich wasn't bad, the bagel was vey good. I added black beans on it and it was a nice change in your usual bagel breakfast sandwich.  The coffee, ugh I'm not going to order that one again. I even tried getting a cup of ice Togo and thought maybe I could drink it iced but it still was not happening.  The reviews looks good here and I think it's worth a try to come back and get my expresso drink I order and see if they get that right before completely writing them off.

Their hibiscus mint tea is addictive...I went through multiple servings of it, made possible by their free refill policy. Then I enjoyed the cripsy fish sandwich, with lettuce, tomatoes, and aioli. So amazing. It was the kind of quality fish sandwich you would expect from a seafood restaurant, so to have such amazing food options at a coffeehouse definitely blew me away. And the sandwiches come with a side of delicious chips and salsa (although there are other options too). It is a great place to come for a meal, or even to get some work done. They have ample seating, including outdoors, and have great music playing at just the right volume to not be obtrusive.

Cherrywood Coffeehouse ," 5/13/2015 1 check-in What a great place for brunch when there's nice weather out! My friends and I actually came here based on the yelp reviews and we were not disappointed. Yelp said they play live music, there was a man playing the guitar. Yelp said atmosphere is slightly hipster/casual, that's pretty true. People tend to be on their laptops doing school work and what not. Yelp said their food was worth it, and yet they are right once again.  I highly recommend the Shrimp and Grits! It is pure perfection with the grits being the right consistency and the shrimp having the right amount of spice. They are also quite generous with the amount of shrimp given in the plate (approx. 10). I would give my plate a 10/10. My two friends got their Crawfish Egg Benedict and said that it was tasty. My other friend got a normal burger and said it was juicy. They all gave their dishes an 8/10.  Only downfall with this place is that they are pretty slow with bringing out everyone's food. They did it one by one, so by the time someone was done, they brought out another person's plate. They also forgot my friends order, so he actually had to go in and bring the plate out to the patio himself. Overall, I would come back here, but there are little things here and there that would make this place a 5/5. Crawfish Eggs Benedict! The best Shrimp and Grits I've ever had! ", pos

Tastes good Bob. Ordered up two breakfast tacos. They got some nice girth. Opened up my breakfast taco and I find as the advertised potatoes, shoe string potatoes. Alright alright, a different take. Shredded cheese on top, but not even close to melted because it was laying on top of the shoe string potatoes.  Like I said, this must be a new take on breakfast tacos and I don't get it. Someone else may and this taco is for you. I like the texture those potatoes provide, but I wouldn't really advertise it as the potato for a potato, egg, cheese, and bacon taco.  I'll definitely come here for coffee again. The first time I went, the staff was really friendly. The second time I went, they were in robot mode. Given...it was really packed.

As others have noted, they are a bit greasy, but doesn't taste greasy (not sure if that makes sense). Coffee was really good and they give you a huge mug.

Cherrywood Coffeehouse ," 6/20/2015 I had brunch here today. I'm rounding this up from a 3.5 review because I feel like this place deserves a second chance due to the fact that I might have just been overly picky about my particular dish.  I ordered the sweet potato hash with black tea. The hash was absolutely delicious BUT it was (1) way too oily (2) the eggs were NOT ""poached"" as indicated by the menu, but instead fried over easy. Due to the hash being way too greasy for my liking, I think I might just stick with the salads, smoothies, tea, and coffee the next time I come by.  I did like the atmosphere, beverages, and general diversity of the menu very much so I will be coming back to try everything out again. ", pos

Cherrywood Coffeehouse ," 11/9/2015 One of my favorite places in Austin. Reasonably priced, super attentive & friendly staff, cool interior, and there's always an awesome playlist on when there aren't local music acts performing.  Most importantly,  the food there is great.  The Terra taco is less than $5 and it's one of the biggest breakfast tacos I've had in Austin.  Their grilled cheese is amazing & comes with cucumbers, onions, & tomatoes. I highly recommend switching out a side of chips for a side salad.  You get a giant bowl of greens with avocado, tomatoes, cucumber, red onions, & feta and it's only $1.80 extra. Their fries are really good too,  but the salad is pretty hard to compete with. Basically, you get a lot more than what you pay for regardless of what you order.  Love, love, love this place.  I come here on a weekly basis & cannot recommend it enough! ", pos 
Cherrywood Coffeehouse ," 10/9/2015 I like this place. It's hardly perfect, and I think that's what I like best about it. It's a slightly chaotic, almost divey (not unhygienic!) sort of place. There is always plenty of seating, it's not overly noisy, a bit dark, and the staff smiles. While they aren't overtly friendly and they are very professional and efficient.  All that gives Cherrywood a personality that I have come to enjoy. It's not pristine, it's not nasty. It's a neighborhood cafe and comes with all the requisite mixture of people, art, and atmosphere to give it its own unique charm.  And to add onto it, the food is good. Solid, fast, and well presented. My burger was juicy and savory and my side salad was delightfully fresh, with ripe slices of smooth avocado on top. Yummy.  Cherrywood is now a central place for me to go for a quick bite to eat, or even just to sit and read while enjoying a smoothie.  Bring a reading lamp though. It is a bit dim in there! ", pos 
Cherrywood Coffeehouse ," 6/30/2015 I'm a frequent visitor of Cherrywood and I've come to the conclusion that it's a very hit or miss establishment.  Pros:  In general I love the atmosphere of this place. It's cozy inside and dog friendly outside. The staff is very friendly and easy going.Their club sandwich is massive,  and extremely delicious. The hot chocolate is smooth and delicious. Plus, they make a pretty mean breakfast taco, which is a morning necessity in my book.  Cons: Aside from the hot chocolate, I haven't had many good drinks here. My chai tea was heavily watered down and lacking in flavor and my mocha latte didn't have much of a chocolate flavor. Food wise, there are lots of tasty choices, but a burger is not one of them. My boyfriend and I both got burgers and they tasted sweet rather than savoury. The meat was mushy and I pretty much lost my appetite a few bites in.  Overall, I would recommend Cherrywood if you are looking for a dog friendly place to relax with some coffee or a snack. Medium hot chocolate. Yum! ", pos

The coffee - They serve good organic coffee and very it's reasonably priced (less than $3 for a large coffee, .50 more for a large café au lait, $1 refills).  The food -The sweet potato hash is okay of you like lots of potatoes; it was basically a pile of cubed sweet potatoes with an over-easy egg and hollandaise on top.  I liked the American Breakfast better.  You have several options and I went with the egg over-easy, bacon, biscuit and hash browns.  The eggs and bacon were standard fare, the biscuit was tasty and the hash browns were nice and crispy.  Atmosphere - There is a lot of seating with several tables inside a chaotic space.  It isn't easy to navigate between the coffee bar, the coffee fixings area (where you may or may not also find salt & pepper shakers) and unlucky you if your table is behind the short wall and line of people because it's not easy to navigate back-and-forth the narrow passage.  People on their cell phones would barely move for me even when I was carrying a big mug of hot coffee.  If you go outside on a Sunday morning it is very family oriented with kid-friendly live music; if that's not your thing stay inside. Sweet potato hash ", neutral

I was skeptical at first, and I was expecting mediocre cafeteria style food. That's not what you get at all.  Their burgers are delicious and I love their selection and range of food and drinks.

I've been coming to Cherrywood for years, and have experienced the hit-or-miss service that's ubiquitous in Austin coffee shops. What keeps me coming back is the variety (and deliciousness) of the food, including plenty of gluten free options, and the solid (if somewhat uninsipired) coffee. Earlier this week I had an hour wait for 2 tacos, which turned out to be quite tasty but I could've done without the mixup. Today I went in and the cashier remembered my issue and comped my coffee. Redemption! Even though the Americano I'm sipping is only so-so (I've had better...... but I've definitely had worse!), it's this kind of courtesy and consideration that makes me love this place. The patio is perfect, and there are plenty of seats inside for comfortable dining/drinking year round. I use this as my meeting place for offsite work meetings, and have always been able to hold productive conversations with colleagues. It's one of my favorite study spots, too. Oh, and it's my go-to for meeting up with friends whenever we need a landing spot to relax and connect.

I am the last person you should be getting coffee advice from, so this review is for the rest of the 99% who aren't coffee snobs.  The iced turbo is so so so good. I wish they had it in an extra large. And can we talk about their crushed ice? The absolute best in keeping your drink ice cold. So addicting and the service is fast so you don't have to break a sweat waiting outside even in the miserable Texas heat. Thumbs up! ", pos

I love sitting in their outdoor section to chat, drink, relax people watch - but when I do, I always end up drinking two Iced Turbos.

I opted for their signature drink the ""Iced Turbo"" ... at this time I was hitting my ""it's been a long day wall and I'm acting like a bitch for no reason"".... thankfully the iced turbo not only was delicious it perked me up and got me back to my normal self.  So thank you Jo's!  Another cool thing about Jo's is that they have a cute outdoor seating area where you can hang out and take a break from your busy day.

Coffee and espresso with a parade of mocha-y flavors for added measure. They whip drinks up fast at Jo's, too; no time for lolly gagging there.  I was really close to filling up a ten-drink punch card during my seven-day stay in Austin...that tells you how much I enjoyed their caffeinated beverages. I was tempted to try their bfast tacos and pastries, but the liquid treats were enough to satiate my morning cravings!

Just follow your nose, it will steer you in the right direction!  Stopped by Jo's after a morning yoga class for a much needed pick-me-up before the day started. There were the typical varieties of hot coffees, but I really liked their different cold brew options (which I went back for later!) Because I was trying to get caffeine in my system as fast as possible, I ordered a small, soy latte with an add shot and it did just the trick.  They have a lot of covered outdoor seating, so finding a table is never difficult. It's actually a super nice place to hang out and people watch, or just put your nose in a book if you have some studying to do.  Jo's is also the spot you'll find the tagged ""I love you so much..."" scribbled on the wall. Ask for the story, it's cute and I'm glad they kept it up.

It was perfect for my taste buds since I take my coffee with no sugar. It uses half the turbo mix and adds more iced coffee.

Yum! You can still taste the creaminess from the iced turbo but the added iced coffee kicks the caffeine up a notch. A great alternative for those not wanting too sugary of a drink. Back in California I'm used to my coffee being dark and strong so this was an experience. I'm so glad we decided to stop here.

The line gets long, both for the coffee and the sign, but people who go here seemed friendly -- people offered their photography skills to the other patrons without being asked and are happy to have friendly chats while waiting for their turn to order. The baristas were also quite efficient and kept the line moving fast.

Jo’s Coffee ," 5/9/2016 As a visitor from out of state, this place was A-OK. It is no where close to the coffee you can experience elsewhere in the US.  COFFEE: That said, within the city limits of Austin, it seems that sweetened, creamy coffee is the common theme among review of 'great' coffee.  We ordered the turbo, which essentially fit the bill of sweet and creamy coffee. It was not bad at all. If that's how you enjoy your coffee, then this place is pretty good.  We also had an iced americano. The coffee was alright. It was not exactly memorable, but it was not bad as well.  FOOD: In the morning, they have what they call breakfast tacos. These are essentially pre-made soft tacos/mini burritos. We got the one with potatoes, eggs, and cheese, and they were generally average tasting. They were slightly too salty, and the potatoes are mashed into a paste. If you're looking for a real breakfast taco, however, go elsewhere. This was more of a quick bite type taco (that's a little bit overpriced for what it is)  SERVICE: We had mediocre and somewhat irritable employees working the first time we visited. They were a little catty about a misunderstanding of our order and pretty much placed the blame on us for confusing them (4 small turbos + 1 iced americano was too confusing).  We decided that, since this coffee shop was within walking distance of the place we were staying, we would try it again.  The second time was a little bit better, but the trend we observed was that service felt borderline preferential to white, Texan natives rather than equal to all. From overhearing how orders went for others to observing the facial expressions on the cashiers facial expressions and demeanor with others vs. us and other visitors, the consistent trend was that visitors were made to feel as though they were difficult customers.  If you're out of quick coffee stops to try, then try this one. Otherwise, stop by and take a photo on the side of the building next to the 'mural,' and move on. We enjoyed coffee at other places like Bleeding Heart much more than here. ", neutral 
Jo’s Coffee , 10/3/2015 1 check-in Ok this place has unbelievable coffee drinks! So much better than your Starbucks cafe. Try the Belgium Bomber drink for a less sweeter beverage or their Iced Turbo drink for a sweeter coffee. They have sugar free and non fat options too. , pos

Jo’s Coffee ," 1/26/2015 8 check-ins I wouldn't say I am a coffee aficionado, but they make a good cup of Joe at Jo's.  Their drinks are always very well made and they have never messed up my order. I work down the street, so I've probably been to Jo's upwards of 30-40 times -- never have they made a mistake, ever (Pretty impressive, right?)  I would highly recommend their seasonal special drinks, but you can never go wrong with their Belgian bomber or vanilla latte. I've been recently switching to just shots of espresso and they are pretty tasty as well.  Sometimes in the morning the lines are a bit long, and on a cold/hot day sitting outside can be uncomfortable. But other than that, I have no complaints about Jo's coffee shop.  If you are in SoCo and looking for a quick cup of coffee, or something a bit more fancy, I'd give them a try. Just be careful to not trip over all the teenyboppers and faux hispters taking photos in front of the ""I love you"" graffiti wall. That can be a little annoying, but oh well, it is Austin. ", pos

Jo’s Coffee ," 5/27/2015 This is not the place to go if you want a solid espresso. However- if you want a sweet coffee-flavored refreshment, it's the place for you. Emphasis on sweet. I ordered the turbo. The flavor was reminiscent of Vietnamese iced coffee. My boyfriend had the bomber, and his drink was less sweet but more watery.  I don't know that I would wait in line for this place. The tacos (from tacodeli) and food options were just okay.  Slightly overrated in my opinion, but worth checking out if you're in soco.

Great coffee. Also, the tacos are surprisingly good! I really recommend the potato / cheese / egg taco. Get two!  The downside is the parking, so be on the lookout for a spot.

I go anytime before a Saturday shift (once or twice a month) or a closing shift, and I am never let down. They also have a great selection of pastries from Quack's.  Ughhh I love Jo's.

Jo’s Coffee ," 1/10/2016 I was disappointed when I visited Jo's yesterday. My friend and I ordered an iced turbo and a small hot chocolate. Upon checking out, the girl at the register rang my friend and I up for the wrong drinks. I apologized for the misunderstanding and tried explaining to her what we had actually ordered, but all I got in return was unfriendliness. As a former barista, I know how frustrating it is to serve several people in one sitting all while trying to appease everyone. However, I don't think I was asking for too much in being polite in her response.  As far as the coffee goes, it's nothing to go crazy for. Maybe I caught Jo's on a bad day, but it just wasn't everything it was made out to be. I hope to give it another shot sometime soon.  The location of Jo's is in an adorable area of SoCo. Even if you don't stop by Jo's and the ""I Love You"" wall, I highly recommend taking a stroll around the neighborhood. You won't regret it! ", neutral

The iced American is one of the best I've ever had (I know my coffee, former Barista here). The espresso is smooth, low acidity, with a natural hint of hazelnut. My wife got the chai and highly recommends that as well!  2. Breakfast is really good!!! This is the best I've ever had for Tex-Mex breakfast food. My wife got the Migas plate, I got the Rancheros. Their use of fresh ingredients is obvious, and much appreciated. Homemade salsa? It tastes like it. To me, fresh cilantro is the make-or-break for good Tex-Mex and they're not afraid of it here!

Arturo’s Underground Cafe ," 11/7/2016 1 check-in Delicious food and a great atmosphere. You walk in and place your order at the counter. Fore warning: they no longer do lunch tacos. Service is fast and reasonably priced for the area, so it's a great spot for business professionals on a quick lunch break. The chipotle chicken quesadilla is absolutely delicious and comes with rice, beans, and salsa.  The seating is all downstairs and quite spacious, as well as a few outside tables. Funky artwork and a huge desert mural encompass the walls.  Never had their breakfast but dying to try it. Also, make sure you get there early enough because they close at 2:30 daily.

Congenial service, and lovely touches in the menu abound.  The Caribbean (French) toast was particularly good, with baked drunken bananas.  The Austin Eggs Benedict is a savory treat.

Arturo’s Underground Cafe ," 11/1/2016 1 check-in Ended up here for brunch around 11am on a Saturday because there was not a wait (we got the last available table). Had never been before because I tend to avoid places around campus when classes are in session and especially during home football games. But, we were in desperate need of sustenance and caffeine so we came in blind.  I definitely dig the quirky vibe and decor here and the ""underground"" is the very small seating area down some steps from the entrance. There are some great art pieces (my favs being the Trump/Clinton as clowns and the rhino) that made my brunch a little more enjoyable because they brought a smile to my face.  The staff here were absolutely awesome! The host/cashier especially. I had called ahead to find out the wait time and he was very kind to tell me there was none at the moment, but that could change quickly. We were sat quickly and our orders were taken promptly.  They have a bottomless cup of decent coffee and their Austin benedict (their most popular dish we were told) was on point. The accompanying bfast taters were hit and miss for texture, but were flavorful. A friend got the Toad in the Hole that was surprisingly delish! The pesto in it was also on point!  We left very full and satisfied and w/tax and tip for just under $20, it was a decent brunch find in the UT/Dwntwn area. Also, we lucked out and got a street parking spot right in front, but there were several other open street parking spots along 17th as well. Toad in the hole The Austin benedict My fav piece of all!

I am SO glad we gave their brunch menu a try!  When we arrived, we were greeted by the hostess and instructed to wait outside at the picnic tables, thankfully we grabbed iced Americanos to cool us down while we waited. Once our table was ready, we walked downstairs to the dining room which is literally underground. Such a cool setting!  As for the food, holy this was the pinnacle of all breakfast sandwiches I've ever had. We both ordered the western melt and added bacon on, because who doesn't love bacon? The sandwich comes out open faced and is probably best eaten with a fork and knife. I cannot say enough about all of the flavors on the sandwich and how well they worked together. I'm not usually a hollandaise fan, and yet I was very impressed with the flavor of this one. The home fries it was served with also had a great flavor too!  Service was great and our waiter was more than happy to provide suggestions and ask for feedback. We also didn't have to wait very long for our food despite the warning on the menu that a smaller kitchen means food may take a bit longer.

We came early at about 8 am on a Friday, but it was getting pretty crowded by the time we left.  The guy up front was SO NICE. He explained everything to us and had some great suggestions for us on the menu.  I ordered a latte as well and they have a good selection of milk alternatives, I had mine made with almond milk and it was delicious.  We ordered the migas and the huevos rancheros.

There were some spots available outside but it was too windy and a tad bit chilly so we decided to just wait a bit longer to get a table inside.  I was surprised that they didn't seat us earlier because when we walked in there were at least 5 empty tables but the wait wasn't horrendous so it's okay.  I decided to order the latte and the Caribbean French toast and a side of eggs. I didn't expect the latte to be so bitter. I had to add 3 packets of sugar before I liked it. The Caribbean French toast was delicious!! It was a huge portion so definitely it. The gave large thick slices of bread which definitely made the French toast better. There were pecans and bananas on top, but the sauce was definitely the best part: dark caramel rum.I totally recommend getting the French toast!!  Overall I'm kind of sad that I tried this place after I graduated so it's more difficult to try other items on the menu when I'm not living in Austin anymore.

Arturo’s Underground Cafe ," 1/17/2016 1 check-in Stopped in for brunch on a Sunday morning while visiting Austin. Had to wait about 20 minutes for a table and the crowd waiting outside kept growing and growing. While waiting one can help themselves to some coffee - nice touch.  Once we were seated we were promptly greeted and served. The waitress was attentive and very nice. Drinks were always full.  My husband had the western melt and completely cleaned his plate, so a win I guess. He did comment on how good the hollandaise sauce was. I had the Texas eggs in a basket,  something we often make at home, so it was nice to find in a restaurant. I was worried the jalapeño bread wouldn't be good, but the flavor is not overpowering at all. The egg yolks were perfectly runny, but the whites were still too raw for my liking. The bread was perfectly toasty and the pesto delicious! Would certainly order that again. Both dishes came with the potatoes, which were well seasoned. Western melt Texas eggs in a basket! ", pos 
Arturo’s Underground Cafe ," 10/5/2016 14 check-ins You'll be hard pressed to find a better sandwich in the nearby vicinity. They serve hot flavorful sandwiches with a side of ruffles (you can upgrade to rice and beans for a couple dollars more).  Usually, I have a hard time deciding between the smoked ham and cheddar versus the Thai grilled chicken. Both are served piping-hot and are under $10. If i's your first time, try the Thai, it's different and probably their most popular in sandwich or salad form.  Don't be fooled by the six or so tables outside, there are plenty places to sit inside down in the lower level in the cool downstairs. It's a fast casual restaurant, so you usually don't have to wait too long for your food. ", pos 
Arturo’s Underground Cafe ," 5/24/2016 I've been breakfasting and lunching at Arturo's for about 3.5 years since I work nearby. The food is always excellent, from the breakfast tacos to the sandwiches to the quesadillas, and their fantastic house-made salsa. But sometimes, I wonder if they're *trying* to go out of business. Let's recap the journey I took this morning:  I called to place my order and it was taken quickly, but I wasn't asked for my name or given an estimated total and/or time until ready. This is typical of Arturo's. In my experience, everything's been ready about 5 minutes from the order placement.  I arrived to pick up my order and after paying had the following conversation with the guy behind the counter.  Me: Hey, do y'all have any updated to-go menus? Guy: Nah, we stopped making them years ago because people kept taking them. Me: ...... Guy: You're welcome to take photos of the menu boards, though.  Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't that kind of the point of to-go menus? Especially if you have zero intentional web presence on which one could depend for an up-to-date menu?  I went ahead and took (and uploaded, you're welcome!) those photos which reflect some pricing changes that took place in the last couple of months.  In conclusion, 5 stars for food, 1 star for business acumen. 3 stars for a delicious and confusing adventure every time.

Arturo’s Underground Cafe ," 11/15/2016 Great place, great vibes. Only complaint is that the Thai veggie sandwich is mildly disgusting. I guess it's my fault for ordering it, but imo it just does not work well. It's Thai veggies, sesame ginger dressing, normal sandwich type lettuce and tomato, mayonnaise, mozzarella, all on a soggy wheat sub. It was pretty gross. But other menu items are a lot better and Arturo's on whole is awesome!!!!! ", pos

We got here right around 11 in the morning on a Sunday and the morning crowd hadn't showed up yet so it was perfect and we got seated quickly. I ordered the Texas Eggs in a Basket and Mike ordered the Caribbean French Toast. My order was so freakin' good -- jalapeno cheddar toast filled with over easy eggs and a shmear of pesto... YUM!! The side of bacon was super crispy -- just the way I like it. Mike's French toast was equally as delicious -- the rum sauce was just amazing!! When we went upstairs to pay our bill -- we were given complimentary chocolate chip cookies!! Get here early because when we were leaving -- they had a line out the door! We'll definitely come back when we're in town again -- I have to try one of the Benedict dishes!! , pos

Food portions are pretty large, I could have shared. Everything was delicious and service was wonderful. It's a small place though so the wait for brunch can be long.

Huge selection of tacos; everything from potato to chorizo, but I opted for my go-to brekky, huevos rancheros. It's served with black beans and great, crispy potatoes. The homemade salsa was Da Bomb!

Arturo’s Underground Cafe ," 5/13/2016 This place was ok. The building definitely has character and is indeed underground. We ordered up front and the food came out fast. The food was ok too-loved the potatoes but wasn't a fan of the Migas which were very oniony and the black beans that came with the plate are just normal beans. I wished that the water was cold instead of room temperature. But other than that, I think it's a place worth trying especially since it's so close to campus! Migas plate ", neutral 
Arturo’s Underground Cafe ," 9/6/2015 1 check-in Brunch at Arturo's!  Spent years by UT campus and didn't know about Arturo's despite being only a few blocks away.  Lucky to have friends who are better at scoping out these hidden gems than I am!  Surprisingly, this is my first restaurant that specializes in breakfast but doesn't serve pancakes.  But my comfort zone!  Alas, the responsibility of a Yelper/foodie is to try new things, I guessssss.  Walking in, this place is very small.  Therefore, if you're coming in during the breakfast/lunch rush hour and don't have a reservation, you may be waiting for a while.  And if you are, you'll be waiting outside, so be sure to prep for the weather!  Sitting down, it feels like every table is organized to take up any nook and cranny of the establishment.  You'll hear everything, see everything, and most importantly, smell everything.  Is it intimate?  Not very.  But is it fun?  Mmm yes.  Like almost half of the party I was with, I ordered the Texas Eggs in a Basket.  Hey, I remember trying to make something like this at home!  This dish is one of their specialties and you can definitely tell.  Cutting into the toast revealed a perfect golden river of egg yolk over easy.  The pesto was a delicious addition and the Jalapeno Cheese bread provided a nice little kick.  The Eggs in a Basket, however, is a pretty heavy dish, and my stomach and palate was saturated only midway through.  The potatoes tasted good as well but was a bit crunchy for my taste.  I would definitely recommend this dish, but I would probably try something else next time.  Very interested in their Eggs Benedict.  Our waitress was really nice and friendly, but was very absent in terms of getting us refills.  A lot of plates were dropped and shatter that day, but the entire environment along with all the employees were super lively. Texas Eggs in a Blanket ", pos 
Arturo’s Underground Cafe ," 8/7/2016 So, thanks to yelp we found this place and it didn't disappoint. From the cold brew coffee to the carafe of mimosas the Diablo eggs did not disappoint.

Arturo’s Underground Cafe ," 6/4/2016 We came in on a business trip to Austin and were looking for a breakfast place for our day off. It was important that we find a good place given its our one day off! After reading some reviews we chose to give Arturos a try.  They opened at 10am (sat) and they were instantly flooded with patrons. We were seated really quickly and brought coffee. I decided to go for the chorizo eggs benny, and my friend got a scrambled egg plate. The atmosphere was awesome, they aren't kidding when they named it the ""underground cafe.""  First of all, the salsa was AMAZING. Probably top 3 salsa's I've ever had (and I've been to Mexico.) The eggs benny was perfect and creamy, they didn't overdo the jalapeños so it was a great amount of kick, and the potatoes were seasoned well and cooked evenly (I would have liked a bit more potatoes on the plate.)  Overall a great spot if you're looking for a nice spot to have breakfast and don't want to get a boring eggs and bacon classic. Eggs Benny, Scrambled Eggs, and Grilled Cheese! ", pos

There was a small wait but we were happy to wait when we saw some of the plates coming out of the kitchen.  We were seated and greeted right away and our server was super busy but was also very attentive the entire time. After ready the entire menu a million times I finally decided to get the Texas Eggs in a Basket.  When my plate arrived I was impressed it was tons of food and it looked delicious. The bacon was cooked perfectly and so were the eggs and potatoes. The egg, pesto and cheese over this incredible jalapeno cheddar bread was an amazing experience that I wish I could repeat all the time.

Decided to skip the appetizers so I could save room for mimosas.   Had the Diablo which was quite phenomenal.  It was rich and tasty.  The hollandaise sauce was just the right amount of spicy.  It was quite filling.  Since it was SundayFunday, the calories do not count.  The coffee was tasty and refilled often.  The ambiance is funky and cool.  There is a Mr. T lunchbox on display.

Arturo’s Underground Cafe ," 1/10/2016 2 check-ins Best brunch I've ever had! Seriously. I'm not usually a big fan of breakfast food but this place is the bomb. I ordered the Eggs in a Basket and it was DELICIOUS! I wasn't even hungry and it was still good. The jalapeño cheese toast, sunny side up egg, and pesto...MMMMM. But for real, that bread is GOOD. Other yummy options my friends got were the El Diablo, Alamo, and Caribbean French Toast. All good choices but the Eggs in a Basket and El Diablo are my favs. Their vanilla latte was also really good!  This place is super cute too. It's like actually underground. We had a party of 8 and we weren't too sure if they could even seat us. It looks so small and cute from the outside but when you go in, there's some stairs that go down to two bigger seating areas. There's always a bunch of people there too so expect like a 25 minute wait for a table. The food also takes a while to come out so don't come here if you need to leave in an hour.  Tl;dr: A hidden gem! Eggs in a Basket and El Diablo are DELICIOUS (aka the jalapeño cheese toast). Be prepared to wait for a table and food. El Diablo. SO TASTY! ", pos 
Arturo’s Underground Cafe ," 8/21/2016 I'm not much of a yelper, but this place deserves a review. It's the week before UT gets back in session on a gloomy Sunday morning and we arrived about 30 minutes before 10 not knowing if there'd be a rush. Aside from another group of 4, we were the only people willing to wake up early to be there when the doors opened. We're fat kids at heart so we salivated over the menu and pictures from other reviews throughout the week. Needless to say, we were ready to order before walking inside.    By nature, I'm a Benedict fan but the Diablo was calling my name. My female companion ordered the Texas eggs in a basket. Let me say this. Phenomenal. The Texas eggs in a basket were my favorite by far. The buttery Texas toast coupled with the egg and smeared with pesto underneath. Absolutely spectacular. The Diablo was delicious as well and my stomach is aching from attempting to finish the lot.  This just became our official breakfast/brunch spot and we'll definitely be back for more. ", pos

There was already 15-20 minute wait. This place is small.. And popular! We ended up waiting more than 30 minutes, but didn't mind. They had self-serve coffee while you waited, and luckily the weather was nice (the only place to wait is outside).  I got to try both the salmon eggs benedict and the spicy Alamo eggs Benedict (sausage, cheddar cheese, and chipotle hollandaise). Both were excellent. Despite how busy they were, the hollandaise and the eggs were cooked perfectly. I get annoyed when restaurants over cook their poached eggs.  Saw other people around me order the migas and the French toast - both of those looked great as well! We'll definitely be back. The service/staff was also excellent. Everyone was super friendly.

The menu looked fantastic and I had trouble decided between a few different dishes. I eventually went with the Texas melt and loved it. It came down to what kind of egg I wanted, and the poached egg here was delicious. A lot of the dishes come with hollandaise sauce which is not for everyone, but you can get it on the side (but I don't get you if you don't like hollandaise). I also had a bite of my friend's Caribbean French toast which was also really good, but one bite was enough as I don't have much of a sweet tooth.

Arturo’s Underground Cafe ," 2/11/2016 Arturo's: is it a coffee shop with tacos, or a taco joint with coffee? It's hard to tell because both are pretty good. Don't be fooled by the small area inside around the counter, the downstairs with seats is pretty large and can fit large parties. The food menu is actually pretty huge, with lots of mexican style breakfast items, especially breakfast tacos. Said tacos were good, but not up to the Torchy's bar, though the migas were nearly as good. The everything tacos were a little soggy and could use more flavor, though luckily there was plenty of hot sauce to be found. The coffee here is also pretty good, especially the espresso drinks that are made fresh. The regular coffee itself was good though I'm not a huge fan of coffee sitting out in a pot all day long.

My wife had a Veggie Benedict (plus bacon, go figure) and I had a scramble with sausage, tomatoes, onions, chipotle sauce, tortillas and salsa (with fruit on the side as an extra).  Tortillas were quite fresh, and the egg mixture had just the right balance of all the ingredients, with a kick of spice from the chipotle.  The veggie benedict was considered the best of Austin by my wife, with a homemade muffin, and a hollandaise sauce that did not overwhelm with lemon.  The side of potatoes and bacon also more than passed muster.  Coffee and a latte were quite good (coffee is a little pricey at $3, but the latte was a good deal), and it took a bit of time for the main dishes to show.  Service was attentive and friendly.

There are many varieties of Quesadillas, but I recommend the ones with corn and black beans in them.  Portion sizes are big enough to fulfill any appetite. It's a little bit pricey, but the ambiance is totally worth it. Cool staff, cool customers, Cool art on the walls...  Even cool books. I liked one of the books on their shelf so much, I actually ordered it off Amazon. ", pos 
Arturo’s Underground Cafe ," 8/31/2015 Had a great experience here. The atmosphere was really good, sweet paintings and the all the staff were friendly & helpful!

Overall A+ Street view of Arturo's Caribbean French Toast... Amazing!!! ", pos 
Arturo’s Underground Cafe ," 7/12/2015 Very delicious. I had a cappuccino and the Migas. My daughter had the French toast and they were sooo good. The food was so fresh! Service great, but come in early, before the time it closes. We got there at 1 and after us they close the kitchen, even when they were suppose to close at 3pm. Cappuccino ... Yum. ", pos 
Arturo’s Underground Cafe ," 4/3/2016 The weather probably bumped this up .5 a star but 3.5 still isn't shabby. We had a bit of a wait and had to stand outside for about 10-15 minutes but it was beautiful out so we didn't mind it at all.  I'll start with the $14 mimosa carafes. it's the perfect champagne to orange juice ratio. Come with a couple of friends and you guys are all set to get your day drinking started with a bang.  As a group we tried the El Diablo, Caribbean French Toast, Bueno and Migas Scrambles --  all two thumbs up. I told our server Gabriella (who was great) that if I had more thumbs I would have given more.  Overall, it was an enjoyable experience and I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a nice brunch spot in town. ", pos 
Arturo’s Underground Cafe ," 6/19/2016 1 check-in Watch out if you blink you may miss it.  Nice small place to go on a weekend for brunch.  Being that the place is kind of like hole in the wall in size iwouldn't recommend it for big groups. Atmosphere was fairly cool. I couldn't really tell if the A/C was on or not, but being that it's underground it was comfortable.  We had to wait in line for about 20 minutes but a place like this is well worth the wait. They did have water outside while you wait and tent to stand in will in line. The menu was simple enough to understand.  NO SUBSTITUTES on the different items.   Food came very promptly and was delicious.  I had the Caribbean French toast ($11) highly recommended.  The right amount of syrup was in the plate to where it didn't make the toast soggy. My wife had the Austin Benedict which came with breakfast potatoes. It filled her up.  I would definitely come back.  You should try it out.

Arturo’s Underground Cafe ," 1/30/2016 I was excited to get brunch here a second time only to find out that I was about to be overcharged on my bill by $20! Please read your bill carefully!  From my last two visits I see that service here is a hit or miss. I told my waitress I didn't want tomatoes with my order and not only did she overcharge us, but she wrote ""no onions"" for my order which I can't justify because the place was not even crowded like it usually is at other times. When we approached the person at the cash register about the overcharge he just laughed nervously and quickly changed it without even apologizing!  While the staff may seem friendly and the food is great I question the integrity of Arturo's. There are numerous other brunch places that are just as good in my opinion, but I don't recommend this place if you are looking for professional and consistent service. ", neutral

Arturo’s Underground Cafe ," 5/1/2016 This place has a really cool Austin feel that presents breakfast plates with eclectic touches. I loved the menus- they all have different covers that sparked a little conversation amongst the group- it's really the little things. The group of us ordered a carafe of mimosas, which I would recommend as a good deal ($16 for roughly a glass and a half for 4 of us vs $4 each for one glass each). Ah, now for the food. I ordered the Texas Eggs in a Basket...which definitely has its own nuances that make it special- jalapeño cheddar bread with pesto etc. I was a little disappointed that when I cut into it, my egg wasn't runny, making the dish as a whole a little dry. I asked for hollandaise sauce to cure this problem and it worked for me but I do with my over easy egg was actually over easy. Other than that, everything else about my dish was pretty perfect. My friends had the Austin Benedict, French toast and the el Diablo. I will probably be back, but will likely try something new. Cute and cool little details ! Pretty yummy! Great hangover cure Over easy egg, not over easy ", pos

Patika ," 11/2/2016 3 check-ins BEST LATTES! :)  Their prices can be a little more than you pay for coffee but trust me, its so worth it!  ICED VANILLA LATTE! You have to try this! Almost every coffee I go to and order lattes they always taste like milk and the syrup. Patika's lattes taste super good! The coffee and milk proportions are perfect! even with the iced one, the it does not get watered down easily.  I'm so glad my best friend introduced me to this place. Its also a perfect place to study! It doesn't get too full here and when it does, it isn't too loud for you to lose focus.  I would love to try their other menus but this latte has stolen my heart.  The employees here are super sweet. They make your order super fast and their customer service is a 10/10. Iced Vanilla Latte $5.09 ", pos 
Patika ," 11/28/2016 Went here on a Sunday for brunch. It was super quiet in the morning. I ordered a latte for my drink which was delicious and served at the appropriate temperature. Pretty much only two ways to screw up the latte for me is to use too dark of a roast on the beans or serve the milk too hot. They didn't commit either of those sins.  To eat, I ordered the kale bowl. This was some of the best kale I've ever had. I'm not sure if it's the dressing or they gave it an extra long massage. All the flavors worked well together with the olives and the tomatoes creating a nice balance. The bowl did get kind of spicy at the end because the thin slices of serrano pepper built up an intense heat in my mouth so fair warning to you who might be spice intolerant.  Would definitely go back for my brunch items. ", pos 
Patika ," 10/27/2016 Listed in Yelp 100 Challenge 2016 I was visiting Austin and needed somewhere to camp out before speaking for one of the campus ministries at UT. One of the church members recommended Patika Wine and Coffee. Since she gave it such high reviews, I decided to drive out to Lamar. As someone else said, Patika is an 11/10 and a great choice. Turns out they were exactly right!  The ambience is so attractive with a mix of wooden table seating and bar seating alongside the wall. They maximize space well. They also have an outdoor patio area in which they also started serving breakfast and lunch.  I knew exactly what I wanted - afternoons I was feeling a cold brew. They actually had some in which it had been refrigerated for 24 hours. Wow, the flavors all permeated together in my mouth like a perfect coffee should. The coffee was quite strong but smooth to the taste- exactly how I like it! Cold brew! ", pos 
Patika ," 11/30/2016 This lovely little coffee and tea shop is located in the shadow of a modern storage facility and at first, I had a little trouble finding it.

I got an almond milk latte and a citrus muffin and sat at a very comfortable bar stool overlooking the busy street. The muffin was outstanding and moist even at 2:30pm on a Friday.

I just tried their new full breakfast and lunch menu for the first time, and will definitely be needing to try more items. I had the Not A PB&J toast, which was the perfect sweet/savory combo and was way more intricately flavored than I was expecting from the description on the menu.  It does seem that it's getting more and more crowded here every weekend, especially after 10.  I hope they expand to include the newly-vacated bike shop's space next door! ", pos 
Patika ," 9/6/2016 Yep, I definitely miss Austin coffee shops. The natural light brought into this place is great. A lot of natural features and minimal so it's not distracting.  They make some mean coffee. Mainly because I remember getting a cup at their little trailer on 4th st years ago. Now look at them. There's ample seating for the size of the place and a community table for meetings or just stealing a seat to get some work done.  It's funny how many Macbooks sit all around you when you're there but that's life.  I'll be back when I'm in town! ", pos 
Patika ," 5/21/2016 1 check-in I do not like coffee, but I love tea!  This place was cool for sure!  I was looking to kill sometime before I met up with a friend and stopped in here.  When you pull in you drive around to the back to park.  They have a nice outdoor patio area in the back.  It's a comfortable little coffee shop with places to chill and get connected.    I ordered the vanilla honeycomb tea and the popcorn trio.  The tea was tasty.  I would order it again.  I liked the vanilla flavor to it.  The popcorn trio was a little different but still good.  My favorite flavor, probably because of my sweet tooth was the caramel pretzel chocolate.  The chili lime and garam masala were ok.  The trio popcorn was a little much to eat alone in my opinion.  It would make a great snack for 2 people - so it is shareable - fyi.    Patika is a cool place to relax with a tea, coffee, wine or beer ... whatever your thing is you can do it and hang here.

Popcorn trio was interesting and unique. Caramel chocolate, chili lime and another one. It's a big portion and good to share. I probably would not get it again because it really wasn't my type.

Patika ," 2/27/2016 4 check-ins Listed in Cutest Cafes in Austin, Austin Espresso Essentials I can't really think of anything I dislike about Patika, and all my experiences here have been positive, so five-stars is pretty deserving. This place is pretty much everything you'd want a coffee shop - an open, comfortable space with a good amount of seating indoors and outside, friendly staff and quick turnaround on your order, and of course good quality coffee with pastries to complement it.  The space is open and inviting, with sort of a modern, minimalistic vibe. I absolutely love the details in the decor - there is unique artwork, a small piano and bench in one corner, flower pots, and super convenient cream/sugar and water bars right in the front of the shop.  As for the coffee - I think that Patika has some of the best latte art I have been given in awhile, and their coffee is smooth and a good balance of bitter and sweet. I would maybe even say it's one the best quality espresso locations in Austin.  In the area, this is the place to go for coffee!

Patika ," 6/8/2016 I liked it more before it became a free office for many.  Interior designer who wields a paintbrush, understands the viewing height of art, understands when to have rules and when to break them. Coffee and service are good, can be slow when packed which is often. Parking is tough.  I loved it right after it opened, when it was a coffee shop for friends gathering and chatting, and before it became a free office space for many lone people to sit at their computers working and talking on the phone.  For me, great cafe but wish it had not become transformed into that place where every table is a home office. The cost payoff for providing free WIFI and free office space for people who pay $2 for a cup of coffee has to be challenging for these adorable tiny cafes... especially when all of the parking spots are filled with nice cars of these nice lone coffee office workers.  Love the architecture and the art and the space, but whereas I used to go about once a week, I now go about once every 3 months. ", pos 
Patika ," 11/16/2016 I have mixed feelings about Patika.    Pros: - Coffee is good. - Interior has a decent amount of seating and it's a pleasant, modern, well-lit space, kind of a Scandinavian vibe.  And it's not too loud or too quiet, just right. - Back outside area has a few semi-shaded tables and is dog friendly (but definitely not as pleasant as inside). - They have communal copies of the New York Times and local papers to read if you are just there waiting for someone, not to work.  Cons: - Service is slow.  I've probably gone here half a dozen times, and never had prompt service.  Not because there was a long line ahead of me either, or because I ordered complicated pour over drinks.  The staff is just very, very leisurely. - Related - some of the staff is a bit too cool for school.   - Limited pastries/food options - they have a few scones and bagels, but not much else.  Although apparently, they have just expanded there breakfast/lunch menu, so I'll have to try again. ", neutral

Patika ," 12/28/2015 2 check-ins Listed in Austin Coffee Patika pretty much fits the bill when it comes to what I look for in a coffee shop. The interior is clean, spacious, and plentiful in natural light (big windows and a skylight). There are plenty of tables inside, and it has an overall quiet and relaxed vibe, making it conducive to studying/reading. There's also a parking lot in the back, so there's no hassle with street parking!  On to the drinks: the vanilla latte is awesome, and I also really like their cappuccino. I'm not much of a coffee aficionado, but I think they both tasted great! The baristas are friendly and make the atmosphere cozy and inviting.  A con, if anything, is that it gets kind of dark if you're here when the sun starts to go down. The actual lights in this place aren't very bright, so if you're coming to study, I suggest coming during the day and soak up the natural light when you can, haha. Vanilla latte! ", pos 
Patika ," 7/14/2016 I ventured to this tiny, tiny coffee shop today for a meet up with my boss for my internship. Patika's significantly sparse square footage is compensated for by it's minimalistic, industrial interior design. The beautiful space is soaked in natural lighting encouraged by large windows and stark white walls that envelop the environment. Although occasionally a little try-hard - I paid particular attention the art that graced the walls, which were a nice touch. Each table essentially was being used a mini home office, which was very conducive to a productive environment - perfect for college student me.  I came in at around 9:30 am, which seemed like rush hour but the traffic significantly subsided after 10:30 am as space became more available and ample. I ordered the sweet vanilla latte and paired with a freshly prepared pastry - both had a quick turnaround. The latte was good with some of the best latte art I've seen in a while, but at it's steep price I wouldn't call it amazing.  Would visit on occasion due to how far it is from campus and it's steeply priced menu, but definitely want to try out the carefully curated, seasonally evolving wine list another time when I'm not presenting a pitch to my boss LOL sweet vanilla latte ", pos 
Patika ," 2/21/2016 1 check-in Relaxing environment where you can easily get some work done or read a book. The best part about this place is the natural lighting! I hate cafes with dim lighting or unnatural LED lights. This place is awesome since they have huge windows that allow the sun to come in and brighten the place up. They have nice large tables where you can easily crack open your books or laptop and let the time pass by.  However, their wifi was terribly slow for me. I read that other people had the same problem so I hope that they fix it soon. I understand that the Internet may be slow when there's a large amount of people but come on, this is a coffee shop!  I ordered their latte and tried out a couple of pastries as well. I usually order Americanos since I don't really enjoy my coffee with milk or sugar, but I wanted to try something new since I heard their lattes were good. I wasn't disappointed! The latte was perfectly smooth and not too sweet at all. Definitely would order it again.  All in all, a solid coffee shop. Definitely would come again when I want a relaxing environment. Regular latte ", pos 
Patika ," 7/9/2016 Initial thoughts: It's so tiny! Patika is a really small and beautiful space with lots of natural lighting that compliments the stark white walls. Sometimes a little try-hard, but it is most definitely easy on the eyes. It is a pretty easy place to focus and get work done during the day (if people are talking on their phones), but I am hoping to go back and see what the evening scene is like. The latte was delicious, of course, and they had a pretty simple, tasty looking array of sweets and Rockstar bagels, etc. It was a little more pricy then I would like, but ya win some ya lose some. There is a patio, which must be lovely if it weren't blazing hot! I appreciate that there is additional parking, but it is difficult to find a spot none the less.  Overall, delicious things being made here, evident by the crowdedness. Additionally, I was uncomfortable by the contrast of cellphone talking/working folk and inappropriate ""TMI"" sort of conversations going on the baristas and their friends. I'm not a prude, but yo. C'mon, guys. ", neutral

Patika ," 5/29/2015 I've been a fan of Patika for the past three years, ever since they just had a coffee trailer downtown. One of the first things I did when I moved to Austin was search for the best coffee in town. After visiting nearly 20 different coffee shops, I found my soulmate in Patika. Not only is the coffee impressive, but all the baristas are highly skilled and consistent in their work. They also appreciate the loyalty of their longtime customers (which can't be said for some of the other places I've frequented in the past). The one drawback? At that time they didn't have a brick and mortar. How I kept dreaming of the day they would, so I would have a place to plant myself for several hours. Well, that day finally came in September 2014!  Since they first opened their doors, I've been a regular. I work remotely, so I affectionately call this place my ""office"". It's really become my second home. So where do I start?  Well, for starters the whole vibe in this place is just awesome. The decor is clean, simple, and modern. There is lots of natural light and a variety of options when it comes to seating - whether it's at the community table, an individual table, or a taller table with stools. You can enter from either the front door or a set of double doors in the back that lead out to a beautiful patio area with a great, big pecan tree.  As a mom of two kids, I'm also really picky when it comes to the cleanliness of a business. Not only is the place spotless, but even the bathrooms are nice. And let's face it, most coffee shop bathrooms are nasty.  Ambience-wise, I love their selection of music. They always put on a good variety - jazz, hip hop, chill electronic, French cafe music, reggae, bossa nova, etc. And as of May 2015, I noticed they have speakers outside now. Even better, is the fact that they have LIVE jazz every Wednesday! Which seems to be VERY hard to find anywhere else in Austin (unless you go somewhere more formal and official for jazz like the Elephant Room). As a jazz lover, I enjoy bringing my kids every Wednesday to just unwind. Reminds me of some fond memories I have of New Orleans. They also do an eclectic mix of live music on Thursdays.  Next is the coffee and food itself. I've had almost everything on their menu. All I can say is I haven't had anything I've disliked. My favorite is their cafe au lait and their cortado (more milk than a macchiato; less milk than a cappuccino). I also love their tea selection - especially this one tangy blood orange tea! Even the cups and mugs are stylish.  In the evening, they have a great selection of wine and beer (including the Japanese Hitachino Nest beer). As for their food items, let's start with their daytime menu of bakery goods and bagels. The bagels they get fresh from Rockstar Bagels and all their bakery goods are made in-house by Bria (not sure if I spelled that right?), their talented baker. She comes up with some ridiculously creative things that I haven't seen anywhere else. A few things that stand out are the glazed donut garnished with bits of chicken 'n waffles, spiced donut holes, the rosé muffin, the peanut butter sriracha cookie, and the chocolate chip corn flake cookie.  Then in the evenings they switch to a different menu of small bites that are fun to share with friends. I love the cheese plate (which comes with toasted baguette from Easy Tiger). The spiced nuts and affogato are also good.  Last, is the service, which is outstanding. Owners Andy Wigginton and Nick Krupa really do run this business to perfection. I admit, at times I can be like a nagging mom (one of those ""annoying"" customers who is always making suggestions) but they really do listen to customer feedback. Several examples.... I (as well as perhaps others) suggested they put more signs in the parking area to direct customers to the alternate parking lot behind Mockingbird. Done. One day I complained about the internet being slow. Done.  As for the baristas, they are all equally wonderful - friendly, professional, accommodating, and consistent. I've seen the same baristas for years, since going to their trailer. And anytime you see the same employees year after year, you know the business is run well and the employees are happy to be there.  One last thing I wanted to say about this business is how welcoming it is to a wide variety of people. For those with baby strollers or disabilities there's a wheelchair friendly entrance in the back; for those on a bike, a spacious bike rack in the front. I often come with my two children; sometimes we'll even bring other kids for hot chocolate playdates or Italian sodas in the warmer months. So, yes, I can vouch it's a family friendly place. I've observed so many different kinds of people - those on job interviews, couples on their first date, SXSW out of town tourists, students studying, friends catching up, and then all the telecommuters, like me, working away on their laptops.  Truly my favorite place in Austin! That's right folks.... food porn at its best. Behold the cherry goat cheese thyme DONUT. ", pos 
Patika ," 10/22/2016 I double-dog dare you to find a coffee shop in Austin that's better than Patika. The baristas here serve up some great espresso, and the space is great for work or conversation. In other words, it's not too loud. Nice! ", pos 
Patika ," 5/29/2016 1 check-in Here I am, and I must say that I am having a great time! Today is a Sunday, and it's the day before Memorial Day.  I am here with my two children and fiancee, and we are a coffee + tea family.  We scrutinize coffee like an interrogator questions criminals.  Here you go  Pros: Menu (very simple)         Quality (what we had was delicious)  Cons: Parking (found a spot, but I could see how this.  would be annoying          Selection (simple menu does not bode well for the promiscuous tongue)  I had two coffees, but the most impressive was the Iced  Coffee.  I told him to go heavy on the vanilla, which he did, and it was perfect.  I can feel the caffeine right now as I'm writing.  The prices were very reasonable.  I only do not give it a 5-star because I appreciate a bigger selection of flavors.  Ironically, the very thing which I applaud is the the thing which keeps me from giving a standing ovation.    Nonetheless, I recommend to anyone who wants to try coffee in this city and not be overwhelmed with selections.  This is the epitome of Quality vs. Quantity. ", pos 
Patika ," 8/4/2016 The mocha latte I ordered was the best, I mean best, ever. Perfect temp, so delicious, and not too sweet! The environment and staff are so inviting, looking forward to going back! The best mocha latte of my life so far! Hot, so tasty, and not too sweet. ", pos 
Patika ," 10/26/2015 1 check-in Great coffee shop with a modern, cozy atmosphere.  I came here a few times while in town. Iced coffee is delicious and refreshing. This place is pretty mellow so never had to wait in line for a long time and coffee came promptly. Service was friendly. ", pos 
Patika ," 10/17/2015 It's hard to stand out as a coffee shop, especially in a coffee shop filled city like Austin but Patika manages to do it.  The coffeeshop is welcoming and the baristas are passionate. They made my latte perfectly sweet and they do amazing latte art. There's a few seats inside and outside, and their patio is dog friendly.  When I went there was a good handful of people, but it wasn't packed with college students like you'd find at Epoch and Bennu. If you're in the area looking for a pick-me-up be sure to stop by.

Patika ," 10/9/2015 2 check-ins Listed in But first, coffee. Patika just makes my heart happy.  So if you've been in Austin for awhile, you know there aren't that many coffee shops with that modern, contemporary feel, so when I heard about Patika, I knew I had to visit.  Parking: There aren't many parking in the lot itself, but there are plenty behind Mockingbird Domestic (one building over)!  Coffee & Baked Goods: I've tried their latte, capcuccino, and iced vanilla latte. My favorite was the iced vanilla latte. Sweet, but not too sweet. They also offer a decent amount of baked goods. I tried the banana chocolate chip muffin, which wasn't as fresh as I had hoped for it to be, so eh.  Okay, let me just skip to my FAVORITE part about this place: the back patio. It's perfect. There are a good amount of tables and the lights strung across & above just set the mood ya know? It gives like this tucked-away, hidden garden kind of feel.  I did take off one star for the slightly-overpriced coffees and the slow Wi-fi, though. :(  But will be back often, Patika! Pretty cappuccino art Cappuccino & Latte ", pos 
Patika ," 9/27/2015 9 check-ins One of my top favorite coffee shops in Austin (#1...#2?...gah can't decide). From their stand to their brick and Mortar, Patika has continually been a go to place for me.  Iced Vanilla Latte and Iced Mocha are my top choices. Their cookies continue to be amazing. Check their website in the ""Baked Goods"" section to see what cookies they're serving. I always look out when they serve the Corn Cookie. Recently I had the Peanut Butter Sriracha Cookie...soft, moist, and one of a kind.  The staff is super humble and are easy to have a conversation with. The atmosphere is great for reading and light conversations. They have an outdoor patio for more chit chat as well. ", pos 
Patika ," 10/12/2015 I have been coming here since it opened. I have been a huge fan. It's small but I have always had somewhere to sit. All of the baristas have been friendly and they have great coffee and tea selection. After hours? Well awesome wine and beer. I am not much of a wine drinker but the beer, they've ad some craft selections that I haven't had before. Pretty good!  My choice is coffee and their almond latte (my go to) is on point. They also have an outside patio area so if you need sunlight, do it. They are pretty cool with dogs (outside) so that's nice. ", pos 
Patika ," 3/18/2015 17 check-ins I've heard amazing things about the coffee at Patika and when I came by, I was definitely pleased. I've come here a few times and I've had a cappuccino, regular latte, and a vanilla latte. All three of which were really good. Amazing? I wouldn't go that far. Although I've had better at other coffee shops in Austin, I would still highly recommend this place.  Parking used to be pretty limited here, but Patika now has more parking spots available. Yay!  The coffee shop itself is really clean and well-kept. There's also plenty of seating available. The ambience was pretty conducive to studying. I always try to sit in the back since it seems to be more quiet while the front is usually occupied by people socializing with one another.  Overall, I've had great experiences coming here and I would highly recommend this place if you're in the area. Vanilla latte. Iced vanilla latte. Cappuccino.

Patika ," 11/23/2015 This place was fine. Nothing special. I needed to do some work one morning and thought I'd find a new coffee shop. I was here for 3 or 4 hours, went up to the counter several times and was very politely greeted as if it were my first time every time. I realize that is hardly the end of the world, and it actually didn't affect my rating at all, but it was a blow to my self-confidence. Am I really so forgettable?  They had a few pastries, but not a large breakfast selection. It's a coffee shop, so I should probably be focusing my review there. Good coffee. They drew a leaf in my latte. Very friendly and helpful employees. Ample parking. A solid 3 stars. ", neutral 
Patika ," 6/28/2016 I dearly wish this place was closer to where I lived! The atmosphere is so cool, the barista was so nice and the coffee is so good. I got a pour-over of the Onyx coffee and it was impossibly smooth- it needed absolutely nothing added. My friend got a vanilla latte and said it tasted more ""real"" than any vanilla latte she'd had before. Good wifi, decent parking and enough of a variety to keep me coming back- which I will!!

Patika ," 10/14/2015 1 check-in Listed in Cawfee & Tee The space is beautiful, the paint, the natural light, the benches with pillows, etc. I love the playlist it's dynamic but still fills the atmosphere appropriately. A little smooth salsa, nondescript yet pleasant French, an Italian serenade.  I enjoyed the blood orange herbal tea, the music, the air conditioning, and the environment I was in. My experience, however, was marred by a group having an open discussion at the communal table. The space, though stylish, is small and sound travels well. That being said I was a bit bothered by the noise. Since I liked the music I didn't want to put earphones in but in order to focus, I had to. I'm not at all opposed to people chatting, but this was more of a back and forth debate of ideas happening at the table which I believe the whole café could hear distinctly.  Also if you're here to study or searching for some quiet time I recommend to check their live music schedule. My experience wasn't the direct fault of the business and so I will be back and hope people use their inside voices.    A plus is you can get wine & beer! ", neutral 
Patika ," 9/16/2015 Austin has a plethora of coffee shops to choose from, so how can you know which one are the best? For me, the most important things are the ambiance, seating, coffee taste, and customer service, and Patika fulfills all of these needs!  The coffee shop itself is light and bright inside, making it a good study spot.  Some Austin coffee shops can be a bit dim, making studying harder than it already is.  As for seating, I've always been able to find a spot.  There are multiple small tables, one big community table, a bar, and a couch to sit at. They also offer outdoor seating! The coffee itself is so smooth delicious (my personal favorite is the vanilla latte.)  The baristas are always super friendly, and one of them even brought my drink to me after I had to wait a while for it.  Overall, Patika has become my favorite coffee shop in Austin and I highly recommend it to any coffee lovers out there! Smooth and creamy, yet not too sweet, vanilla latte! Feat. barista's handy latte art ", pos 
Patika ," 3/25/2016 1 check-in What do I love?  Coffee is delicious and they take particular time making drinks.  The baked goods (scones especially) are DELICIOUS!  Unique flavors, and always fresh.  I think they make everything in house.  Prices are pretty reasonable, but you are paying for quality.  They have a good amount of seating with a ton of natural light and even tables outside.  What needs some work?  The avocado toast.  The bread wasn't actually toasted and there was way too much feta cheese on it.  I would also say that I've been in a few times and experienced the coffee shop snobbery that I think people fear.  Most of the time they're friendly but I think they could kick up the service a notch. ", pos 
Patika ," 2/4/2016 9 check-ins This is my favorite coffee shop in Austin! Every drink I've tried here is great but my favorite is the mocha latte. The wifi is pretty good and they have an outdoor patio for when the weather is nice. But my absolute favorite thing about is the natural light!  While some coffee shops can feel dark and dingy, Patika's interior is bright, clean, well designed and has many windows so that the light can flood in. The music they play is not at all distracting so this has become my favorite spot to crank out some essays and do some reading, especially on a weekday when it's a little less busy.  However, I was here one evening and I found out that it's not very well lit apart from the natural lighting. If you're looking for a spot do some hardcore studying at night, this may not be your place. ", pos

Patika ," 7/5/2015 1 check-in I got hooked on espresso a couple of years ago and now I can't stand any sort of drip coffee, so I definitely appreciate a good espresso when I can get it. Patika didn't fail me in that department. And wait.. They have beer too! And wine? Coffee and beer and wine? Yep. While I was there, they were playing a bunch of pop music from 2006-2011 (give or take a few years). Not really what you'd expect from a coffee shop, but hey, I appreciated it. I'd like to go back and try some pastries. They didn't have many while I was there. ", pos 
Patika ," 6/11/2015 4 check-ins I was pleasantly surprised by Patika. After seeing their branding and the buzz around it and in accordance with my desire to visit all coffee places in town (evil laughter), I was delighted to come here for a little creative date a recent past Saturday.  Upon parking in one of 4 or 5 total spots in back and sitting at an outdoor table, I was delighted to walk inside and admire that the interior was a lot larger than I expected (originally anticipating being in a very clean Honda Element or something).  Upon seeing Sightglass Coffees on their shelves, I recovered from becoming the emoji with heart eyes before ordering a house coffee (delicious) and a goat cheese biscuit (delicious). And you know what, the house coffee was a mere $2. After I mentally passed out from the adorable succulents and fun toys at the cashier, I poured myself glasses of water and chatted with the studious neighbors.  We Austinites, so spoiled with the fantastic neighborhood coffee shop. Well this is no exception, and I'll take spoiled all day errday. I give them 100 (underlined) and would love to come back! ", pos 
Patika ," 2/5/2016 Very good coffee shop, but not good for remote work. I was so excited to see that they opened up a brick & mortar shop - I used to frequent their trailer downtown. Average prices for espresso or drip coffee. Very well decorated on the inside and I love the music they play in the morning.  My only complaint is the wifi. It is unbelievably slow. I work from home, which means I work at coffee shops. It's imperative that the internet works well. When Patika is crowded (it usually is), forget about doing research/browsing the internet. Any web pages will load slowly, if at all.  I had to leave early a few times because I couldn't get any work done :( They should definitely upgrade their internet plan for the volume of people working at the shop. ", pos

Patika ," 11/10/2014 1 check-in Great new addition to the neighborhood!  This coffee spot has Cali-cool roots, without the pretension.  Modern interior with a simple blackboard of ordering options, keeping things no-fuss.  I noticed it was almost completely full with seating inside but really quiet, which is great if you come to work and not gab.  I'm sure this changes throughout the day as it shifts into beer/wine time, which they seem to have a great selection of also.  There's also a nice little patio out back with plenty of seating.    I ordered a sweet latte (vanilla) and mixed berry coffee cake and both were delicious and beautiful in presentation.  The food options were really interesting and not your average coffee shop fare.  The pricing seems about right and the quality is definitely there.  Only bummer was parking-only a few spots in the attached lot, so I needed to find parking on the side street (Kinney).  So many people walk/bike/bus in this area though, that I'm sure it won't be a problem for most.  Bonus points for the killer music selection (again, not your average coffee shop) that was low-key but still entertaining...think Al Green and a fun R&B version of Seven Nation Army.  I also noticed a few people putting things on their ""tab"", which is a great idea I hadn't seen before in this type of setting. Happiness. Mixed Berry Coffee Cake...the real deal! ", pos

Patika ," 9/29/2015 1 check-in Disclaimer: I am not a cool hipster.  Came here to study with a friend, who had seen good reviews about it. Got here around 5 on a weekday to a relatively quiet, easygoing place. Massive points because I was able to park in the front, but do not fear if you get here and you don't see any parking! They do have some extra spots on the side and in the back :) Just make sure you don't park next door at the bike shop--they specifically ask you not to (via a paper sign on the door).  Got their chai latte, which was really pretty and delicious! Has a much more spicy taste than I'm used to, but I think I'm a fan. Also tried their vanilla latte, which is a little bit more bitter than I would like, but definitely pretty and yummy! Also, the baristas are pretty friendly, which I really appreciate. And their menu sign is fancy shmancy hipster (aka on chalkboards). Unfortunately, was down to study, so no wine, but seems like they have a fairly nice selection of elegant wines. Will come back on a more relaxed day to try those.  They have a nice piano near the back--not sure if it's just decoration or if people are actually allowed to play it.  Super easy to be productive here because there's just coffee shop music and rustling sounds of people (if you wanna block it out, bring headphones). They have big and small tables, so you can study with up to 4 people per table, or just 2, or even by yourself. For metal chairs, I think they're pretty comfy, but they also have wooden benches that have cute pillows on them.  Usually when I come to study at coffee shops, they're always filled with students trying to study/hang out, so it's either loud, packed, or worst case scenario, BOTH (especially places closer to UT campus). But VERY excited to find this place because it's so chill and quiet; easy to get work done (but this was on a Tuesday, so come on a weekend at own risk)! ", pos 
Patika ," 4/23/2016 1 check-in A nice little place with big windows, lots of table space and reliable wifi! My study buddy and I were able to get some work done over delicious coffees and fresh baked goods. There are several cute little nooks and crannies to relax in, and big tables to spread out and get work done. Is it slightly expensive? Yes. Are you surrounded by hipsters? Yes. But we are in South Austin folks, it's to be expected. Relax, people watch, count the jorts and snapchat the trucker hats. It's a nice little place to stop and enjoy, especially since it hasn't been overrun by students like some of my other favorite places. ", pos 
Patika ," 11/3/2015 The five stars is for the iced latte, which is basically the best I've had. Worth going back for over and over. I had to add a bit of half and half and splenda, but I do to all my coffee drinks. With a bit of half of half it was heavenly. I also had the hot chai latte, but do not recommend it. The chai latte is not as good as Panera's or Bottega Louie's in LA. The cafe has decent wifi (a bit slow) and is REALLY clean. They also put long pillows on the wooden benches, which was a fantastic touch.  There wasn't enough parking right next to the cafe, but you can find additional parking one shop over on the unpaved back lot. ", pos

Patika ," 2/1/2015 2 check-ins Listed in a latte love I liked Patika.  The coffee was good--not the best I've ever had (although this is strictly based on a vanilla latte), but it was good. Solid, even. It wasn't super far from campus, but it was past the river, and a little out of reach, so I wouldn't say I'd be back often.  Patika is a very cute, quaint, and modern coffee shop, and everything is decorated with light wood and white walls. There seemed to be an outlet near every table, which was really convenient. Lighting is perfect for studying/working, and the atmosphere was very warm. Most people in the back of the shop were working, and most people in the front of the shop were chatting, so it was kind of a half and half environment (a good thing, not a bad thing). There's also this cute patio out back for those days with perfect weather!  Parking wasn't THAT bad. Granted, I came on a Sunday, and I missed the building by a second, so I parked in the neighborhood without even looking at their tiny parking lot (and by parking lot, I mean four or five spaces in front of the building). The neighborhood wasn't far at all, and there were plenty of spaces, so parking is definitely do-able. Don't be scared to come if you're scared about parking (I almost didn't come because I was scared about parking, lol).  Service was friendly--I didn't really talk to the barista, tbh. But he brought my coffee over to my table, which always surprises me because coffee shops usually just call it out at the bar. I thought that was really nice.  I ordered a vanilla latte because I had gone to another coffee house (Figure 8) yesterday, and was craving that same taste (but I had wanted to try a new place). I don't know why I did that--I pretty much got my hopes up for nothing because no coffee shop's taste is ever exactly alike.  Their vanilla latte was good. Definitely better than Starbucks or your late-night Bennu's and many other coffee shops, but it was heavier on the steamed milk than it was on the espresso--I wish it was justttt a littleee richer. The sweetness was nice and very subtle though, great for those who don't like over-sweetened coffee.  Great place for coffee and working! Will be back~ ", pos 
Patika ," 5/25/2016 Updated review Updated review because though the pastries are amazing and coffee is good, the service can be quite slow.  I actually go there way less now because it's so cold in there.  On weeknds it's nice to grab a book and order a bunch of coffee for an hour but I go to other coffee shops b/c they keep it so cold in there.  If you are serving beer and wine and want people to stay or go more often, it would be nice to not keep it freezing.  It's been like that every time, so I only go there once every few weeks not instead of every weekend. ", pos 
Patika ," 6/5/2016 I was looking for a coffee shop in the area after taking a class at Sukha. Not the area I would normally hang out so I turned to Yelp for help. Found Patika so I decided to give it a try. I was lucky enough to find a parking spot right in front of the shop. But there are plenty of street parking in the nearby neighborhood if you can't find a spot in their small parking lot. I wanted to try their latte and pastry (I know I shouldn't have but it was so tempting). Their pastry was made in house and the presentation was great. I had the hardest time deciding between pineapple morning cake and lemon raspberry white chocolate muffin. So I turned to the guy at the counter for his recommendation. He recommended the pineapple cake. I'm glad I listened to him because the pineapple cake was delicious! I got my latte a few mins after, and it was definitely one of the best latte art I've seen in Austin. It's a bummer that it's really far from my house and work. But I'll definitely stop by whenever I get a chance to be in the area. ", pos

Patika ," 10/10/2015 1 check-in Patika is one of the better options in town for quality espresso and filter coffee.  Lately they have been carrying Ceremony Coffee Roasters from maryland which is a nice break.  Traditionally their trailer was the best place in town to try Cuvee but they are mixing up roasters more at this shop.  Prices aren't over-priced, this is standard speciality coffee pricing.  The new in house pastry selection here is awesome.  Especially the rotating gourmet-whatever donuts with creative flavors.  The parking lot sucks balls but at least there is tons of parking next door that you are allowed to use.  Inside is always completely crowded with people sucking up wifi but they have tons of seating out back so I guess it's OK except when its 100+.  I'll also agree with another review that the clientele is mostly douchbags from California so you are gonna deal with that too. ", pos

Cons: - Easy to miss in the Lamar clutter  Treat yourself to a scone and coffee here. ", pos 
Patika ," 10/8/2015 Good coffee and friendly baristas. They pour a great cappuccino and don't skimp on the cream cheese with your bagel.  I'm not giving it 5 stars due to the lack of parking and some of their clientele. I probably shouldn't judge, but it's really annoying to hear 2 middle-aged narcissistic Californian women chat. I've been here numerous times and about half the time you get some really annoying self involved people talking about their unimportant over dramatized bs. Headphones, engage. ", pos 
Patika ," 12/8/2014 1 check-in I had an extremely delicious mocha here yesterday, and it sealed Patika's place as a worthy coffee stop on the south Austin rotation. Last week, I attended an event here and had some of the best pastries of my life. We went back on Sunday especially for the French Onion biscuit, but unfortunately it wasn't there. The goat cheese and sundried tomato biscuits they did have looked tasty, but we really had our hearts set on the french onion.... So my only recommendation to patika is to post a bakery schedule or even tweet or fb the daily goods for those who have a favorite!  Otherwise, definitely worth a stop - smooth, delicious coffee drinks, great snacks, and a really nice modern but still warm decor. You can pick up coffee accessories here, too, like chemex and filters. ", pos

The interior is very nice and roomy and not crowded on weekdays (I haven't gone on the weekend so I don't know about the weekends.) The outdoor seating in the back is really nice too.

Patika ," 12/16/2014 1 check-in I'm a total Patika fanboy. There is absolute magic in their drinks.  I am serious when I say this is the very best coffee I have ever had. It's no joke. No bitterness or burned taste whatsoever. I could drink their liquid happiness all day long.  The staff is friendly, the drinks are delicious, the atmosphere is quaint and quiet, and the bathrooms are surprisingly well-done. Did I mention how good the drinks are? They're fantastic.  This is THE place to get coffee in Austin. ", pos 
Patika ," 5/6/2016 This is the best coffee shop in Austin. Their espresso is so smooth and it doesn't leave you with the shakes afterwards. The only thing I'd improve is the internet. Sometimes it gets pretty crowded so the internet becomes basically impossible to use. I think I'd come here more if I knew the internet was reliable. The coffee is so great though, it's worth just popping in and out. ", pos 
Patika ," 12/17/2014 1 check-in Went on a Sunday at 10:30 and there was parking right in front. There were a handful of people inside, and a handful outside on the patio enjoying the balmy winter day. Had the straight black coffee and loved it. Really liked the knowledgeable staff, music, skylights, ambiance, etc. Will definitely be back. Someone came in before me and cleared out all the food, so watch out for the pastry monster Sunday mornings... Exploring Conversations and patio in back.

Patika ," 12/24/2015 Good coffee with a lot of emphasis on style and taste, except for the fact that they serve it LUKE warm.   I don't expect burnt Starbucks coffee when I pay $6 for my latte but I do expect it to be warmish hot.   Apparently if you want it hot, you need to ask for it ""extra hot"" I was told. ", pos 
Patika ," 1/3/2015 4 check-ins Although located in a busy section of south Lamar, the parking isn't terrible. It's pretty funny the bike shop next door has a sign that says free parking at the coffee shop with the purchase of a bike.  Coffee selection is good and thy also have tea choices for those that don't drink coffee. Seating is also decent with wide windows to look out into the Lamar traffic (if you're into that stuff).  The employees are also very hospitable. ", pos 
Patika ," 9/26/2014 1 check-in It's a bit out of my way, but what isn't when you live in north Austin?  Your basic coffee drinks, and a handful of pastries, I was expecting more food based on things I'd read. But maybe more food is coming. And I don't see any info about wines in here, but maybe that's because I'm here at 10am. No worries.  This place is painfully representative of all the other locally-owned coffee places in Seattle... I mean Austin. Small, and concentrating on a select few items, this place is a dime a dozen.  But don't get the impression that I dislike this place. I definitely don't. Local businesses are tops in my book, as a typical Austinite. The kids who work here are very nice, and I enjoyed my beautifully-decorated cappuccino. It's just that I didn't see much of a reason to go out of my way to come here again like I did this morning.  However, today is their official grand opening, so we'll see what the next couple of months bring.  If you need me in the meantime, I'll be at Fair Bean Coffee. Or Dolce Neve. Or La Patisserie. Or Once Over. Or Bouldin Creek. Or Seventh Flag. Or Epoch. Or... See all photos from Catherine T. for Patika ", pos

Patika ," 11/16/2014 Battled the misting cold weather to drop in for a cup of coffee on Saturday.  Parking is not great. We were able to snatch a spot as someone left, but there's probably only room for about 8 cars.  Baristas were friendly. Baked goods were decimated, which was disappointing since so many other reviews rave about how delicious they are. I ordered a latte and my SO got an Americano. I enjoyed mine, but I felt like the milk foam to steamed milk ratio was more in favor of a cappuccino.  Overall, I thought it was a solid coffee shop, but I don't really see a reason to stop here versus Seventh Flag on S. 1st, which has better parking and more space. ", pos 
Patika ," 12/29/2014 From the outside, I thought this place was going to be small but it is super spacious. It is a very chill place that is great for studying - they have a patio out back as well. The coffee is great and they also sell a variety of baked goods.  The only problem I forsee is parking. Tea and cake ", pos 
Patika ," 10/21/2014 1 check-in Oh my what a cute place to come to and get caffeinated and get some work done and/or some socializing and catching up with your friends.  First time I came here I was greeted with a gorgeous smile from one of the gorgeous baristas behind the counter. Eye contact, smiling, and a nod to sit anywhere me and my friend would like was the best greetings. We weren't entirely too sure if we should sit and wait for wait service or go up to the counter. The baristas friendly greeting gave us the cue to sit down and get comfortable. Waters were brought out as the barista greeted us & was provided a wine/beer and coffee menu. We were pretty set on getting a bottle of wine and he was more than happy to suggest some great reds on the menu. He also told us it was happy hour so it was $3 off a bottle of wine! SCORE!  The atmosphere is absoutely gorgeous at night. Dimmed lighting, clean and modern spaces to work on and sit back and enjoy in as we sipped our wine. I even saw the back patio getting a refreshed spritz of water over the succulents. The ambiance of this coffee and wine spot is definitely worth checking out and coming to especially around happy hour.  Music was low and unobtrusive and overall the place was calm and quiet. We were given a nice helping of nuts and snacks that were made in house and had the best herbs and roasted nuts in town! WOOZA! It was delicious!  I will have to come back and try some coffee since this shop is right in my neighborhood. Forget Starbucks down the road...come here to Patika. ", pos 
Patika ," 7/5/2015 As someone who both has a caffeine addiction and has worked in the cafe industry I have to say Patika is far and away the best cafe in Austin! The management is pleasant and wonderful, and the staff friendly and knowledgable. Everything feels like home, with a simple, and yet ingeniously designed interior that is warm and comfortable. Every time I go notice some cute detail that I hadn't seen before.  When I say the staff is knowledgable I'm not kidding. Every shot is perfectly measured, pressed and poured. They carry quality beans and their cold brew is fantastic and completely not acidic. Their alcohol selection is solid as well.  To not just sing their praises and stan over them this whole review they do have a very small selection of drinks and food. But even then it's the mindset of know what you do and do it well. They may not have the selection other cafes do, but unlike other cafes anything you order is going to be the best you've had.  Their baked goods are stellar, their baker (a lucky hire straight out of school) is one of the best bakers in the city. And their items are at times avant garde and yet always amazing. (If you can get your hands on their Chicken and Waffles donut it's a must)  If you haven't been to this cafe yet you must. And you'll probably see me there. ", pos 
Patika ," 12/27/2015 Was in town for a concert so the morning we were heading back home, we decided to get coffee. This place had super awesome ratings so it was a no brainer to go here! The two ladies who took our order were very nice. I'm a sucker for a good latte so I ordered an almond milk latte. I wasn't too impressed. It tasted sour and bitter. I couldn't even finish it! Granted, this was the only thing I've tried here, so maybe everything else is phenomenal. But my experience was mediocre at best. ", neutral

Patika , 2/13/2016 Cute place but the service was lacking. The girl who took my order for tea had friends come in right after me and proceeded to talk to them for 10 minutes before I walked up and asked if my tea was ready. She had clearly forgotten about it and told me that the water was waiting to get hot. 5 min later she brought it out. They stayed until closing and I basically heard their whole loud conversation the whole time. The other issue is that it's a little too dark. I was doing work without a computer and really could have used some more light at night. I will definitely give it another try though. , neutral 
Patika ," 1/15/2015 I only have it 4 stars instead of 5 bc of parking. Parking is a little limited, but it's not impossible to find a spot. It surely doesn't stop me from coming back though.  It's a small place, but it's charming. It's a bit bigger on the inside than I expected. Lot of natural light and space.  I've only tried getting a soy cappuccino so far, and it's pretty up there on my list of favorite coffees. I'll have to go back and try the others.  Also, I'm a big fan of the pastries.

Patika ," 10/20/2014 Patika is the best coffee shop in Austin, hands down.  I have visited Patika 6 or 7 times since it recently opened on Lamar, and every visit has left me more than satisfied. With an inventive chef, welcoming staff, and a hip atmosphere, I don't think I will ever visit another coffee shop on the south side.  Here's why:  The COFFEE is consistently delicious.  The selection of PASTRIES (particularly the breakfast cakes, of which I've had a few) are unique and baked to perfection. The chef really knows what she is doing. The spiced nuts and cookies are so so great!  STAFF are incredibly friendly and customer-service oriented. On multiple visits I have received free samples of snacks and pastries.  The afternoon MENU of snacks, beers, and wines is small but diverse and high quality.  the ATMOSPHERE is hip and simplistic, the way that a coffee shop should be.  The CAR PARKING is sufficient and I have only once struggled to find parking, but this was on a night when there was an event at the coffee shop.  BIKE PARKING is visible from inside the coffee shop, which is great if you want to keep an eye on your bike.  forgot to add: MUSIC: Patika has a great playlist!  Overall would I recommend Patika to a friend?: YES, this would be the first coffee shop I would recommend no matter where your relative location in Austin!

Patika ," 10/10/2015 So my coffee standards are high to start with , so I will say the bar is set out of reach for most. Patika is awesome, they are genuinely nice to you, and make a hell of a good almond latte and cortado. I had the avocado toast a few days ago and it also was impressive. I have never had to wait in line here either but I do go at off times typically, none the less very cool place. ", pos 
Cenote ," 11/1/2016 Great place to study or hang out with really good food and coffee. Some seats weren't the most comfortable but there is a selection and there is also a nice outdoor space with seating. Plenty of outlets too, which is nice. This place was way less crowded than a Starbucks, and had a bit more of a quiet vibe. The tables were mostly small, so I wouldn't recommend it for a large group.  Be careful when you are outside, because there were lots of mosquitoes when I went around dusk. ", pos 
Cenote ," 10/15/2016 Went today, and I have to say that the vibe and environment is cool.

Parking - Meh, I've had worse in this part of town. Curbside and the ""church"" parking lot that still is a short walk to the place. Food - My salmon spring rolls were excessively salty with whatever sauce they put in them. I had to remove the salmon to scrap off the sauce and had to accept that it was a lost cause for the drenched rice noodles. I felt really cheated out of 1/2 my meal. Drinks - The mimosa drinkers next to me seemed content which their selection. Seating - My large group who showed up in pieces were able to sit together on the covered patio ", neutral

The salad had mixed greens with raspberry, mango, avocado and other fruits. Served with a tangy cilantro Lime dressing. The portion sizes are huge and the price is well worth it. I would like to come back to try more things off their menu. Only 2 drawbacks I experienced - filled up my chai so high that when I picked it up from the bar it spilled over on my hands (hot!) and you have to throw away your trash and put away the plates. If we are paying tip, I feel like full service should be included. Huge cup of chai! I was buzzed the rest of the afternoon. ", pos 
Cenote ," 9/25/2016 1 check-in Very cool, hipster place to get coffee and a light snack in East Austin.  I loved the vibe here.  It is obviously a favorite neighborhood hangout at all times of day.  Both times I visited I had the iced vanilla latte.  It was delish!    My favorite experience was the day they had empanadas as a special.  I tried to bacon and potato empanada.  It was not the empanada of my childhood in Panama, but it was yummy.  There was a spicy guac type of dipping sauce that definitely gave it a kick.  My favorite aspect of this shop was the people watching.  There is a very diverse crowd that visits here and they were all extremely friendly.  If you are looking for inside seating to avoid the heat...Good luck.  Seats were one or two for the taking but groups are pretty limited to the patio areas.

Cenote ," 8/28/2016 2 check-ins I dream of this place. On a Sunday morning in NYC, filled with delicious brunch spots, Cenote is what I think of. 100%. If you are in Austin, I'm marking this as an absolutely must try.  This is a locals spot. You see grad students working on their laptops, people writing screenplays, friends catching up after work, carb loading after yoga. Cenote has this absolutely Austin feel.  What you need to try: 1. Chai latte - dirty. Get that espresso shot. It doesn't matter if it's iced or hot. This is one of the best chai lattes I have ever had. 2. ALL THE BREAKFAST TACOS. I love the migas taco for the texture of the tortilla strips. The chorizo has so much flavor. One taco can fill you but two will put you in a happy food coma. 3. $4 mimosa? Done. 4. Potatoes. 5. All brunch items are fantastic. $13 for tacos and a latte. That's the best price point for amazing food.  This is definitely not a large group place. Parties of four or less are the best way to go. Also, if you're ordering a drink, remember to grab it from the counter before you sit down. Either way, Cenote is one of my favorite places in Austin and best breakfasts/brunches that I've had. Whether or not you're living in Austin or visiting, going to Cenote is always a good idea. All breakfast tacos and chai lattes See all photos from Kathryn T. for Cenote ", pos 
Cenote ," 11/23/2016 1 check-in The food was surprisingly excellent! We had three appetizers during happy hour, half off until 7pm! Can't beat that deal. The root vegetables were a surprising hit for an appetizer, but goat cheese rarely steers me wrong. The 'lasagna' was more like mousaka, but that's taking nothing from it - excellent. We also had the yucca fries which are more like hashed cakes. I liked these a lot, but the 'chutney' was a bit too sweet for my tastes - however, the portion was enormous. The staff was not what I'd call 'friendly', and didn't know much about the food, but they were patient and efficient, which is a rare combination. We will definitely return to try the entrees, but we're too full on this trip. $25 with a beer and a coffee is an outstanding deal for this food! Well done! Coffee shops with beer are always a hit.

Cenote ," 11/12/2016 Tasty coffee, cool patio, and great breakfast options. Favorite dish = kale salad with salmon. One critique of their ceviche Thursday happy hour: it seemed like the ceviche hadn't been marinated long enough, and had a really raw texture. The shrimp was completely translucent. The internet tells me that, though the ceviche may still be translucent in the center, an entirely translucent piece is just sashimi.

Cenote ," 9/5/2016 This ain't no grab and go breakfast sandwich. It's also not a $3-4 one.  For about $11-12 I had a bacon, egg, and cheese on ciabatta, and an iced vanilla latte. Since this was my breakfast and lunch (I was studying for the long-term!) I didn't mind. The breakfast sandwich was yummy (I'd do almost anything for a good BEC) and the latte was good as well!

Cenote ," 3/9/2016 1 check-in Did you see my photos? Go look at them. We came here because it's been on my bookmarks for ages and we have fiiiiiinally arrived. The sandwiches. I mean really. For a vegetarian you're in heaven. They've got two veggie options so we went with both. They came out supa dupa fast, big, beautiful, and packed with flavor! They generously fill those big beautiful buns with a ton of veggies and very special sauces.  I was a little worried they would taste the same but they were both totally different. The ""Veggie Sandwich"" was my favorite with massive beets, a big helping of carrots, avo, and sprouts, and chipotle aioli puts it over the edge. The bread was also amazing and crispy on the outside.  The ""Beet It"" Sandwich was filled with spinach, beets, and tomato pesto concoction. Very very good. We will be back. Beer and coffee!

Cenote ," 5/9/2016 1 check-in Listed in Austin Guide Came here for brunch.  It's a very ""Austin"" place with its quirky paint scheme and a large metal octopus outside and multiple porches.  Basically, someone just renovated a house and turned it into a restaurant.  I had the BBQ Grilled Chicken sandwich ($12), which was quite good.  Cenote was packed when we visited, so it took a while to get our food.  They weren't doing a great job bussing the tables, so we had to wipe down our own outside.  When we were done, we were unclear if we were supposed to clear our plates (we did) or let an employee do it.  There was a pile of used plates in a bin next to a garbage can swarming with flies, which is a fun way to end your meal.  Cenote draws a crowd, so it's a little hectic.

While Cenote is a very cute, Austiny location, with a cute homey feel, and garden-like outdoor and patio seating, their food and drinks are quite underwhelming.  The coffee is very average; any standard restaurant or cafe has equally decent drinks. I don't think I'd come here specifically craving their food or drink, though I do still consider it a nice place to hang out or study. ", neutral 
Cenote ," 5/3/2016 Tried this place awhile ago and I quite liked it. The inside decor is super hipstery, but a bit dark on the lighting. That could also be because I went on a rainy day and it looked like they rely on their windows a lot.  I got the eggs benedict which was pretty good! I actually really liked it, but it's one of those dishes where by the time you're about 3/4 done with it, it gets a bit repetitive. So you could say I was a lot happier when I first started eating than at the end. The potatoes that come with it are excellent though, the perfect amount of crispy! I added avocado which costed extra, but it definitely helped with the creaminess of the chipotle hollandaise.  Overall, I liked Cenote a good amount. I don't think it's super amazing, nothing to rave about, but it's definitely a decent place with some pretty cute decor. Eggs Benedict. Rainy day led to this bad lighting :( ", neutral 
Cenote ," 2/23/2016 1 check-in We came to Cenote for the free cheese board and stayed for the Fried Picante Chicken Mac and cheese. Antonelli's Cheese was having a free cheese special at participating restaurants around town a few weeks ago and that night one of the specials was at Cenote. I had my eye on Cenote's breakfast menu for a while, so I figured their dinner entrees must be just as appealing. Cenote looks like a normal coffee shop from the inside. People on their laptops, smell of espresso, etc., but they do have a kitchen and they also serve booze.  Luckily we arrived just in time to get a free cheese plate. It had three Antonelli's cheeses, strawberries in some kind of strawberry sauce, honey, crushed roasted nuts, and bread. Needless to say I ate the entire thing. Boyfriend ordered their Mac and Cheese which had fried chicken and picante in it. It was fantastic.  Also, be sure and check out their website, because they have different specials each weekday night. Wednesday is 1/2 bottles of wine (they've got sparkling too).

Cenote ," 11/8/2015 1 check-in Such an east Austin, hipster, trendy spot. Good food at fair prices and with healthy quality also. Super insta worthy place, especially on days with nice weather, as the majority of the cafe is an outdoor patio area.  Fish tacos were surprisingly delicious for a cafe, non mex spot. Excellent flavors and a nice small salad of greens to accompany the dish.  Mango fields salad was simple and light, but nothing special. Perfect for if you want a refreshing light meal or snack though.  My only drawbacks of cenote would be the lack of parking, lack of availability of some menu items, long line that we encountered, and the long wait- all signs of a popular venue, but we were expecting an in and out, order at the counter and get your food right away type place. So make sure to set aside enough time to enjoy your meal here because it might take a while! Fish tacos Mango fields salad- not much mango though :/ ", pos 
Cenote ," 10/26/2015 1 check-in Let's start with the positive: This place is super cute! I love their set up and in typical Austin style, they were able to gut out an old house and make it a functional place to serve people.  As soon as you walk in, you are able to go to the counter and order what you want. The food menu offered a variety of sandwich and breakfast items when we came in for Sunday brunch. My honey got a breakfast sandwich, I had the banh mi sandwich and my friend ordered their omelette. We also ordered tea, a cappuccino and a soy latte.  Service: Nothing to write home about. My friend, who always orders her coffee drinks with a half shot of espresso, complained about it not being strong enough. They asked for a dollar to make it stronger.  The drinks: There are so many good coffee places around Austin (and down the street), that these guys really need to stop offering such weak ass coffee.  The food: This is what made me give them three stars instead of one. Everything on our plates were delicious. To be fair, the omelette was more of a scramble than an omelette, but it was great! My banh mi sandwich was gigantic and had the thickest cut of pork belly I'd ever seen. My boyfriend had to finish it off, but only cause there was so much of it.  Overall: I doubt I'd come back. The food was good, but nothing really stood out as exceptional. That, combined with the weak coffee, leaves a lot to be desired. Banh Mi - Giant deliciousness Cappuccino ", neutral

One of the first things I noticed at 8am on a Saturday was the completely reasonable beer prices.  $2 tall boys, and a variety of local taps for $4 - $5 each.   If I lived near here I would probably come in for beers sometimes just because the prices are solid.  On the food side, I had the breakfast sandwich with Egg, Avacado, and Cheese.   I don't usually dig on Ciabatta bread, but this sandwich was solid.  Needless to say, if I am ever int he neighborhood and I want a beer or a sandwich, Cenote will probably spring to mind. ", pos 
Cenote ," 2/16/2016 If I were to judge this book by it's cover it would be the a bestseller. It's as if you were stepping into a neighbors house to join them for tea when you walk through the door. It's definitely a 5-star ambiance. Quaint and homey.  Luckily, I dig deeper than just viewing the cover of books and have come to realize that this place is all bread and no meat. (is that a cliche?) The food is ok. The service is ok. The coffee is ok. There are always 3-4 people behind the counter and they definitely care more about their conversations than their customers. It's not a bad thing, but it definitely doesn't feel like you're being greeted by your neighbor. More like your neighbors kid who just got back from their first semester at college.  This is not a great coffee shop to work remotely at, either. You're lucky to find a table inside, because it's so popular. But, if you have a full battery and it's not too sunny, the outside is a great place to be. ", neutral 
Cenote , 4/19/2016 I wasn't a huge fan of this place but now that they've revamped their menu a bit I feel like I can go here more often. It's one of my best friend's favorite places so I've dined here a bit more previously than in the past! I've taken vegan friends here and picky eaters here and there's literally something for everyone.  A few notes on their new menu: I split their burger once with my friend and it was great! (although a bit hard to eat as it was massive).  I've also had their mango salad and thought it was pretty good. Then I ordered their arepas and they were pretty good but SUPER salty. Almost so salty it was hard to eat..so definitely the food has been mixed for me. Would try some other things as well. I love that they have a very spacious patio that is great for spring hanging out in Texas as well as working during the day.  I love that they have coffee as well as beer and wine. The guy at the register cracked me up in line so that alone is worth coming back for. , pos 
Cenote ," 7/6/2016 Cenote has been my go-to cafe since I have been in Austin.  I've come to cafe about ten times in the past few weeks and have ordered the turkey club a number of those times.  On my last visit, I asked the waitress to toast the club because I noticed that the turkey was unusually cold, but the bread was nice and warm. She then explained to me that the turkey club was a cold sandwich and let the chef know, who came out of the kitchen to take a look at me.    It took a few minutes for her to bring out the warmed club.  When she brought it to my table, she condescendingly let me know that I should ask for grilled turkey moving forward.  Thanks for making me feel uncomfortable. ", neutral 
Cenote ," 9/26/2015 1 check-in Came here for a quick morning breakfast before my flight - - Chai Latte - It was one of the best Chai Latte I've ever had.  Although I don't usually go to coffee joints, I definitely could see myself starting to if I live next to a place with concoction like this. - Turkey Avocado Sandwich: To be honest I didn't expect much for this sandwich; I mean it's just a regular sandwich right? A sandwich is a sandwich...So i thought.  As I picked up the sandwich I noticed how toasted and crisp the bread was, and I knew deep down they took special care of this piece of work; and the first bite?  The flavors, the freshness of the ingredients, and the texture of the bread with avocado meshed and fused into a power level 9000 sandwich....wait what are we talking about here again...?  LOL Chai Latte! ", pos 
Cenote ," 11/7/2016 Nice place with very healthy food options. The dish I ordered, eggs florentine was very spicy and the eggs were a bit overcooked. My friend really enjoyed her dish, a breakfast burrito. I would try it again but choose a bit more carefully. It was so crowded when we were there I didn't feel like we could linger as there were a lot of people waiting for a table but that is always a good sign! ", neutral 
Cenote ," 1/20/2016 1 check-in I was very impressed with Cenote.  They have coffee, beer, solid food and a fun atmosphere.  I will be back here the next time I visit.  I ended up with a pint of 512 brown ale and some fish tacos.  The tacos were pretty awesome and the beer was a great pairing with it.  Pro-tip 1, you sort of seat yourself here.  You place your order at the counter and they give you a number.  If you have a group, it might be easier to stalk a table first and then order separately.  Pro-tip 2, they were awesome about my wife's food allergies.  I don't know if they necessarily bill themselves as being allergy conscious but it was easy for them.  This was a pleasant surprise on our trip and I highly recommend it. ", pos 
Cenote ," 9/9/2015 2 check-ins I'm glad i don't live in Austin because I'd overkill my daily chai intake. Cenote has the best iced chai that I have ever tasted! Just that drink itself would make me come back.  My friends got the burrito, parfait (which I heard was exceptional), oatmeal and the migas and everyone enjoyed their meal. I had the special which was prosciutto, goat cheese, arugula on ciabatta bread and it wasn't too bad! I would come here again for the atmosphere and outdoor seating. The patio is so huge and it's dog friendly. Iced chai latte never disappoints! Cozy indoor that has trees painted on the wall to match the theme of the greenery & outdoor patio. ", pos

Cenote ," 6/10/2015 14 check-ins This place has got to be one of my favorite coffee shops in Austin. Parking is always a bit tricky but absolutely worth it.  If you can't find parking right near the front there's always a spot on 2nd street just behind it.  This place has a very unique vibe to it, I bit hip and funky I'd say. Located a few blocks from i35 on the corner of Cesar Chavez and Medina. There are lots of tables outside even a smoothie bar located right out front which is ran separately.  Okay so why my favorite? Where do I begin, let's see. First and foremost their coffee is some of the best tasting in the area. I'm a big fan of their cortado and if you like chi tea they make their chi In house  it's suburb. I've tried many dirty chi lattes around town and this is the best. Mmmm .. Okay then I love the fact that it's a coffee shop with wifi so you can get some work done but they also have beer on tap! Yep, that's right, grab some local craft beer while you're here. Then lastly, their food is bomb. The breakfast taco is HUGE and only $3.50. Sausage egg and cheese is where it's at. I had their chicken Pozole soup once and I've been craving it ever since. Let's see what else have I had, their oatmeal is good, comes in a huge bowl. And today actually I tried their tomato zucchini soup, pretty tasty.  And the atmosphere never gets old. Great spot, great people and the staff have always been so so very friendly. I'm a regular! Breakfast tacos are huge and only $3.50. One is filling enough for me. See all photos from Tiffany S. for Cenote ", pos 
Cenote ," 7/24/2016 Hipster food with lots of hipster vibe! Food is just okay. Actually it made my stomach turn a bit. I ordered their Migas with chorizo and it was not very good. It had the hipster look of course. Everything looked fresh and inviting but it was bland at best. It was covered in corn chips to a point that made it seem more like nachos than Migas. All that corn made me feel sick.  Also, we were sold on a dish being gluten free, but when we insisted talking to the manger to double check we found out that it actually wasn't. These mistakes just can't happen when your wife has celiac. She would have been really sick and that's just not cool!  Yes, this place is a nice relaxing spot, but their food is bland, their coffee mediocre and their staff are more interested in being ""hip"" than they are knowing their menu. It was disappointing overall and I'm in no hurry to come back.  I'm not mad at anybody, cause I get what they're going for, it's just to me personally, being hipster doesn't automatically equal ""happening""! ", neutral 
Cenote ," 3/29/2016 Their sandwiches, OMG SO GOOD! HUGE and I couldn't even finish all. I will be back to try their sandwich with beet!  just be warned that the line can get LONG but worth the waiting. Iced lattes with chicken flautas and grande breakfast burritos with my love. ", pos

The migas plate was better than expected in a beautiful extra crispy and greasy kinda way. But, the best part of this place is the staff and the beautiful house and patio. I love the vine enclosed patio. One of the servers would soulfully never know the lyrics but still sing along, and the guy who checked me out was super friendly and reminded me to GET HYPED about game of thrones tonight.

For now, this place is a three for me.  The space was too cute for words, the coffee, which is what I went for was in fact, A-OK but not great, and I didn't think it was as good as some of my 4 star places.  I witnessed some delicious looking food and would like to spend an afternoon on the generously sized, fenced (YAY!) patio when it warms up.  I am confident that when I come back and eat and lounge outside this place will be at least a four, completely worth checking out. ", neutral

Cenote ," 4/22/2016 1 check-in Breakfast food + outdoor seating = All I need to be a satisfied customer. I was really excited to come try this place and I'm glad I did! A few of my girl friends and I came by for some breakfast early Saturday morning and it was packed in here. They have two lines to take customers' orders and the line went out to the door. Even in midst of the busy morning, I was well taken care of and the workers behind the register are people-loving people. They make small talk/ conversations with you and it was a good way to start off my morning. The food was great- with lots of flavors! The weather was nice so we decided to sit outside and they brought us out our food. My Americano, however, I had to go to the bar to get myself. It was really a crowded wait for the water and my coffee- I wish they had more room or another dispenser for water to make it less hectic! Overall, I had a great time dining here. ", pos 
Cenote ," 10/2/2015 1 check-in This place is pretty awesome.  Love the outdoor wrap around patio and garden seating, plus the indoor vibe is pleasant and uncramped. The outdoor art is a fun touch -- I regret not taking a selfie with their big green bullfrog statue. The interior space is lovely as well with high ceilings and turquoise walls.  Besides the aesthetic, the cubano sandwich was fantastic, and we tried the Cobb salad as well. It was gorgeous and tasty! For the price and variety on the menu, what's not to love here?  It was five o'clock somewhere, so we tried their seasonal mango sangria and were not disappointed. The portion was generous and it made for a refreshing palate cleanser on a hot day. The fresh chunks of strawberry and mango provided a healthy dessert too. ;) ", pos 
Cenote ," 5/10/2016 2 check-ins I love love love this place!  Their coffee is awesome - strong, but not bitter, smooth, creamy, and has almost no acidity.  The first time I came here I just ordered a drink but the second time I ordered food as well.  The turkey club that I got was definitely a generous portion but it wasn't all that great (I think it needed some crispier bacon and slightly softer bread).  It wasn't bad though and I would be willing to try something else the next time I go.  The best part about this place are the generous seating options.  There are benches in the front if you want to sit picnic/family style and there are smaller tables and chairs in the back - all shaded.  It feels like you're sitting in your friend's backyard.  The decor is incredibly cozy and cute all around, a perfect spot to catch up with a friend or to bring a date. ", pos 
Cenote ," 8/18/2016 I am more so reviewing the place in it's entirety. The food isn't great but it's better than expected for coffeeshop food. But the atmosphere and the darling outdoor seating on the front porch is what brings me back. There is a good amount of indoor seating and a ton outdoor. It's a great place to come early on a weekend morning (not past 10, it gets crazy busy), have good coffee, and enjoy the weather. Also a great place to grab a drink with a friend (less busy at night) and sit on the porch -- I did this recently when it was raining, and it was beautiful. ", pos 
Cenote ," 9/20/2015 When we arrived at a little after 10:30 am on September Sunday morning, there was a line out the door to order, but several open places to sit both inside and out.  We were able to order within 15 minutes of arriving and food came out shortly thereafter.  Cenote is both an excellent coffee shop and dining establishment.  This old frame house with interior painted walls depicting trees is filled with charm and serves high quality coffee and food.  The latte that we ordered was smooth, well foamed, and without bitterness.  There is plenty of seating at tables and the wifi speeds are a respectable 13 Mpbs download (I've managed to do work using VoIP at 1.5 Mbps).  The bread on the turkey avocado sandwich was soft and moist, and the sandwich ingredients were piled high.  Everything was fresh and the added bacon for $2 made it that much better.  The salmon salad was surprisingly large, served in a chilled bowl was a giant portion of kale, garnished with slices of beets, halved grape tomatoes, nuggets of goat cheese and dressed with sumac yogurt and a fennel vinaigrette and topped with freshly cooked salmon filets.  Very fresh, very filling and reasonably priced.  It was hard to choose what to order (grilled breakfast burritos and chilaquiles were vying for my attention), and I'm eager to go back to try more of the menu. ", pos 
Cenote ," 11/13/2016 Cenote is a quaint, counter-serve restaurant located in the heart of one of Austin's oldest and most eclectic neighborhoods. The interior evokes all the charm and character of the rustic, DIY design that's come to define the I-35 corridor. The menu, while lean in the number of its offerings, provides both variety and quality at a tremendous value. Meals are prepared in short order and delivered hot to your table by a staff that is professional and engaging.

No, I want raw, unapologetic, real deal people with strong attitudes and stronger coffee.  As I first walked into Cenote, the sweet sounds of Pantera blasting out of the PA system immediately put my mind at ease.  The gentle giant behind the counter was kind enough not to break my nose after noticing my hulk hogan tshirt (it's still real to me dammit) and even gave me a solid ""whats up dude"" greeting.

The breakfast burrito here is probably the best I've ever had. You can tell they put some effort into the recipe instead of just throwing stuff in a tortilla. There are some great subtle flavors that show the quality here.  There is a discount if you pay with cash which is super cool.

Regardless the parking was what I was most worried about so it wasn't that big of a deal. ", pos 
Cenote ," 7/10/2016 Love this place and bike here frequently, but they gotta stop raising their mimosa prices! I can get one cheaper at the four seasons!!! ", pos 
Cenote ," 7/23/2015 2 check-ins Although Yelp has made it difficult to find a bad meal in Austin, I think my fellow Yelpers has sold Cenote short!  Great atmosphere, close to downtown but not in all the crowded hassle. Cenote is a cool oasis on The trendy east side. I came in during the dinner rush and had no problems getting the order in or finding a table. The salmon and kale salad was excellent!  Just-right salmon atop a bed of tender kale greens with beets, carrots, pecans, blue cheese, and a tasty vinaigrette. A lot going on in that bowl, but absolutely delicious. Thanks Sara P. for the recommendation   If you're n Austin, get out to Cenote any time of the day for good food. Kale and salmon salad ", pos 
Cenote , 1/17/2016 Awesome sandwiches. Great coffee. This place is definitely worth a visit and I will definitely go back. It gets pretty busy on the weekends but there is a lot of seating (both indoor & outdoor).  Cashier recommended the Turkey Avocado sandwich and i loved it. , pos 
Cenote ," 12/3/2015 Cenote is exactly 3 stars. It's ""Okay"" It won't give you food poisoning, but it's not that great. I like Cenote for cuteness, location, and the JuJu Juice outside. The coffee is so-so. The service is hit or miss. The internet is shotty. It's where I go when I get tired of Austin's other, better coffeeshops, because I spend too much time at them.  The amazing thing about Cenote *used* to be the food, but they seem to have changed the kitchen staff. Ordering the same dishes that used to be amazing are not very good anymore. For example, the vegetable plate a few months ago was phenomenal. Today, half of the veggies were overcooked, the other half undercooked, and all covered in ridiculous amounts of flavorless oil. Why? Why would you do this to my veggies, Cenote? And at $9 for a small portion and snotty counter service? No way.  But, in a pinch, when everything else is getting old, Cenote is there. And it's ... fine. ", neutral

Cenote ," 12/5/2014 1 check-in In Austin from San Antonio for my nieces wedding. Found Cenote as a local recommendation.  I had their house salad which included avocado and cilantro vinaigrette dressing. I was impressed with the large serving for the price; wonderful tasting. Followed that with the perfectly prepared Seared Atlantic Salmon which sat over a bed of couscous, tomato confit, basil, & kale. This was ""presentation"" and taste to match! Yes I had to have the cappuccino ~ ", pos 
The Hideout Coffeehouse ," 11/13/2016 1 check-in I was in Austin for a few days and needed to find somewhere to get some work knocked out...this was the perfect place for that!  I went in the morning hours so they had their breakfast tacos out and the place was hopping. Let me give you a couple tips because I obviously went in clueless on how the place worked but soon figured it out. If there is a line go and grab your tacos out of the crockpot first and then get into line. They have around 6 different versions which are labeled in paper bags. They also have salsa available. They are smaller tacos but one was the perfect amount for me.  Grab a cold brew, it's completely delicious and will get you completely ready for a productive day. They even offer $1.00 refills but I didn't need one due to the perfect state the first one put me in. Seating is pretty plentiful and restrooms were clean. It definitely seemed like a hotspot for meetings too. Check this place out! ", pos 
The Hideout Coffeehouse ," 10/26/2016 I come here for the espresso.  At one time or another I have spent time at almost all of the coffee shops in Austin, and I only drink espressos. Many of the coffee shops/cafes in Austin have a specific type of espresso, and it has a very tangy/fruity/acidic taste. I'm not a big fan of this espresso taste. Call me traditional, but I like my espresso to be dark, chocolaty, smooth, and Italian.  There aren't too many places in Austin that serve up traditional espresso, but the Hideout Coffeehouse is one of them. They use Katz coffee, and they pull incredibly smooth shots that don't have that very sharp after taste. So if you're looking for a place with chill vibes to relax or study, and have a good espresso I would recommend this place. ", pos 
The Hideout Coffeehouse ," 7/18/2016 When you walk in the place feels very Austin-y despite being in downtown Austin.  Or maybe I just loved it because all the tables were filled with people there by themselves. I came in waiting for a friend for happy hour, but this is a great place to come with a book or with work if you're downtown. I did not get a coffee drink this visit, but I did order a grilled cheese and appreciate they have food-- they even have hoboken pie by the slice!!  I gave 4 stars for a small menu. I'm excited to go back and try more, but it did seem limited.  Side note: I was panhandled here from a guy asking for money. I saw the barista ask him to leave, I understand people need money but as a single girl downtown 8 hours of the day, I appreciated this jester from the barista.  I was also panhandled recently at starbucks across the street and they did nothing. I'm from Austin, love Austin, and appreciate when businesses help me feel safer in downtown Austin. ", pos 
The Hideout Coffeehouse ," 10/19/2016 I love the vibes in this place! ""D"", a barista here, is so friendly and helpful. It was my first time visiting and she was great.

The sandwich was huge and a little too much cheese and grease but overall pretty good! ", pos 
The Hideout Coffeehouse ," 7/17/2016 Great little coffeehouse right on Congress Ave.  Cold Brew is on point and if you plan on doing work the refills are inexpensive.  I opted to get some work e-mails done AND stream golf on a Sunday on my iPad. Internet was able to support both. Plenty of power as they have surge protectors throughout.  Bonus: Breakfast Tacos!!! Amazing! I didn't try anything other than the cold brew and the tacos, but other goodies looked fresh and delicious. Doing work and watching golf with my cold brew! Awesome! ", pos

For a small shop they keep a pretty large selection of local food products. I didn't try the food but the green tea was delicious and refills are only $1.  My only complaint is that the wifi was a bit on the slower side and it even wasn't packed that day. Otherwise, the chairs are comfy, the vibe is chill, and the drinks are reasonably priced. Good green tea, comfy chairs, laid back vibes. ", pos 
The Hideout Coffeehouse ," 4/10/2016 1 check-in Pretty cool interior and vibe.  Honestly didn't love coffee, but after the strong espresso of Boulder,Colorado it's hard to compare them fairly!

The Hideout Coffeehouse ," 9/8/2016 Great little coffee store in Austin. Plenty of seating, good wifi and coffee.

Don't let the construction next door bother you - the shop is tucked away on Congress and no noise in here. ", pos 
The Hideout Coffeehouse ," 6/22/2016 Who knew there still existed such coziness in Downtown Austin?!  I work in dt, and only visited this coffeehouse yesterday. It was like stepping into an Austin business from 20 years ago. The smell, the furniture, and the intimacy of the place made me incredibly nostalgic.  I got a simple brewed coffee and had it black. It was good and fresh, despite it being the middle of the day. Can't wait to curl up with a book here over a weekend! ", pos 
The Hideout Coffeehouse ," 11/16/2016 Ever since I had the Hideout Hazelnut Latte here, I've been dreaming about coming back for more.  It is possibly the best latte I've ever had in my life.  The foam on top of the latte were like soft, marshmallows against my lips.  I've never felt anything like it, it was so inviting and comforting.  And then, you get the taste of the hazelnut warmth and it's like you're in heaven.  I'm trying to describe this the best I can, but really, it is nondescribable.  You have to go try it for yourself.

The Hideout Coffeehouse ," 1/9/2015 2 check-ins Downtown, and need a place to chill where you can, like, chill?  This is what coffee houses used to be like: cool, comfortable, low-key. The kind of place where you just start up conversations with other people based on their hair or shoes or the phone they're flashing. Cause its easy.  The coffee's good, the prices are fair, the servers look you in the eye, and there's plenty of room to lounge and visit which, on a cold afternoon, is much better than drowning your sorrows in a beer.  Yes, the parking is a bitch: its downtown, remember? But if you want to be treated like a human, meet some interesting peeps and really get to relax even if its just for a few moments, skip the corporate stores and try the Hideout.  You can thank me later. Main sign at The Hideout ", pos

The Hideout Coffeehouse ," 1/25/2016 1 check-in Great to see a divey joint in the middle of Downtown Austin, and indeed a hidden joint. While the Internet is usable, the connection can be slow. I also felt that the music was a little distracting and a bit aggressive for a cafe. Service was great and quick though. I got the cold brew. If you're looking for a caffeine fix that is generally more affordable in Downtown ATX, consider the Hideout. ", pos

Banana nut bread and raspberry lemonade!! ", pos 
The Hideout Coffeehouse ," 1/24/2016 The right amount of sugar and chill. Nice low key coffee shop. All of the quality without any of the snobbishness. Snagged an apple fritter. It was awesome not to sweet and it wasn't dry at all (trying to avoid using the word mo*st) but it was! Also grabbed the gorilla mocha which was super tasty. Not too heavy and just sweet enough. Lots of mochas tend to be too syrupy, but the gorilla was just right ", pos 
The Hideout Coffeehouse ," 12/13/2015 Went to work here for an hour on a quiet Sunday afternoon. Nice atmosphere. Got a beef and cheese sandwich with some coffee - both were tasty.  I'm removing one star because the guy who served me had a serious attitude. He left me standing waiting to be served while he was writing something in a notebook, and when I said 'Hello' as he came to serve me and he just replied 'Yes?'. Then when I asked for a savory croissant he just said abruptly 'There's none', so I asked if they still had sandwiches to which he said 'Of course we have sandwiches'. Then he threw my credit card back at me on the counter instead of handing it to me. Don't know what's up his ass today but I let it slide. Such a shame mate, be nicer to your customers. ", pos

The Hideout Coffeehouse ," 2/3/2015 I've been thinking about how I could do this place justice with some words on the internet...for DAYS...and I just can't. I mean, how do you properly communicate to someone the stream of tears you cried, doubled over laughing hysterically or the number of times your ass came up off of your seat in a fit of laughter?!  I came across The Big Bash event listing a few weeks ago while looking for something interesting to do as part of my 30th birthday festivities. This seemed fitting. I had zero idea what to expect, but can I just say that any expectations I did have coming in here were blown out of the water in the first couple of acts.  I've seriously never laughed so hard in my life. It's better than Whose Line is it Anyway, but the same idea...improv that encourages suggestions from the audience and even audience participation. That's right folks, I volunteered to ""help out"", but when they said I'd be doing sound effects for everything Roy did I about passed out. I don't do sound effects...and I definitely don't do them while I'm cracking up. I was in literal tears by the time I sat back down.  I could not have been more impressed with this production or the people in it. Roy, one of the improvers, was also the person I was in contact with ahead of time, and he graciously reserved seats together for our party. So professional and you can tell these entertainers are totally invested in their craft. Otherwise, it wouldn't have been nearly as impressive.  I'm already planning a return trip! ", pos

The Hideout Coffeehouse ," 3/21/2016 3 check-ins Cold brew is excellent, even with almond milk - which tends to water iced coffee down. The barista who took our order did not greet us nor ask if we needed anything else, only nodded when we asked questions. As it is the first day the town is back to normal after SXSW, I'll give them a pass and return in case the staff is just exhausted; but it is why they get three stars instead of four.

I am on a cold brew kick right now and theirs really got my blood flowing, so thumbs up there.  My tip would be, try their harvest loaf. I literally had to hide it from myself so I wouldn't devour the whole thing at once. ", neutral

I typically drink my coffee black, but I really enjoyed the whatever chai they use and would definitely be back at this coffeehouse when back in Austin.

I went during the Monday of SXSW so non badge holders were still allowed, but there weren't any seats inside so I had to leave after getting a drink. I got the hideout hazelnut for about $4 and was pretty pleased with it. Usually I'm very wary of these types of specialty coffees because they're loaded with sugar. However I asked for less caramel and sweetness in general, and the barista was really good with that because I loved my drink! ", pos

The Hideout Coffeehouse ," 10/14/2015 The location is pretty neat looking, although I had to admit I hesitated before sitting on a very dirty looking bench. My latte was good and so was the specialty flavored cream cheese on it. I found it strange, however, that the barista called out my drink when it was ready but the person that prepared my bagel did not. I looked back to see why my bagel was taking so long and saw it on the counter. This happened to another customer and when he said, ""I must have not heard you call my name,"" the woman who prepared the bagel simply said, ""I didn't call your name."" Odd.

I'm more than sure that this great city has tons of them, but I can't think of a better first impression than the Hideout Coffeehouse.  I popped in after spotting it while walking down Congress and immediately fell in love.  The first thing that was evident was that they had a solid array of drinks.  From coffee to teas, there are plenty of options for all caffeine lovers. I settled on an iced tea since I was a little sweaty after exploring Austin.  I almost bought a sweet treat, but restrained myself...this time.    The atmosphere is relaxing and it's fun just to look at the variety of artwork on the walls.  This seemed to be enjoyable not only for me, but for the other customers that I was people watching (a bit of a hobby for me).  There were plenty of outlets on the walls for those in need to get a little work done.  I'm intrigued by the theater aspect of this place and will have to check it out next time I'm in the area.

The Hideout Coffeehouse ," 2/25/2014 Hideout definitely is hidden away...or was for me, Admiral Oblivious. I first stumbled onto this place one February morn but a year ago. A friend (I'll call him He-Man) came over to my place around 6am that Sunday so that we could go cheer on our friends who were running the marathon. He-Man brought his cousin...and a box of wine.  Oh boy.  The day started out nicely enough, despite the fact that I didn't get any coffee. We drove to our first intended cheering station, where my sign was the clear winner (BE BEYONCE). He-Man ran after our friends when we saw them, and almost got hit by a slow-moving bus.  It was then that I realized He-Man and his cousin were still drunk from the night before.  We then moved on to the next station...or would have, if He-Man the navigator hadn't lapsed back into a boozy stupor. We ended up stuck at the front of a line of traffic waiting for a gap in the pain parade for an hour and a half. He-Man and cousin made water in the bushes, while I tromped straight up to one of the neighborhood houses and asked to use the bathroom like a human being and a woman who doesn't like to bare her ass for a line of traffic.  Anywhooooooo...a gap finally opened up and we sped off. As the hours wore on, I became painfully aware of my growing caffeine deprivation and subsequent headache. We ended up parking near downtown at the Mexican American Cultural Center, where He-Man emptied his stomach in front of a high school kid he used to coach. So that was great.  Having given up on the rest of our cheering stations, we made our way toward downtown. It was at the corner of Congress and 4th Street that the cousin and I turned away for a second...and when we turned back, He-Man had disappeared.  At that point, a few other people joined us, but I was the only person among the group who was concerned about my friend He-Man, who in my imagination had already fallen on a cop. The group halfheartedly searched for a couple of blocks, and then we all decided it was time to sit down.  Voila! A gorilla in the mist! Hideout Coffeehouse! How is it that I had never seen or heard of this place before? Must have something to do with the name. Tucked away in its own little corner, the place had exactly what we needed: Caffeine, beer, and a multitude of pastries. We sat near the front at tiny copper tables, which are exactly the right size for a laptop. Semi-dark interior, local art, big windows, music that doesn't deafen you, and cool baristas. A great end to a marathon of a day.  He-Man eventually found us, and so did our newly-medaled friends. So maybe it's a great place to tuck away and get some work done in a low-profile environment, but I wouldn't use it to, you know, hide from the police or anything. ", pos 
The Hideout Coffeehouse ," 6/29/2014 1 check-in Hotel dining is highway robbery, so it was worth the half-mile trek to Hideout for substantive cold brew iced coffees and perfectly satisfactory breakfast tacos. The feel is laid-back bohemian. They unpretentiously offer a whole menu of ""specialty"" sweet drinks, and there's a space in the back for stand-up comedy. ", pos 
The Hideout Coffeehouse ," 10/29/2012 What a gem!  Aside from Boite, this is my fave coffee shop now!  Their breakfast burritos are so tasty, and at $2 (or something else ridiculously affordable) they are a steal.  Great coffee as well.  Woman at the counter was so sweet, and patiently recommended her favourite offerings to get a taste of their café.  Very comfortable atmosphere + good coffee + Texas breakfast burrito = an odd combo that seriously works.  When in town, I will be back! ", pos

They make excellent coffee and I usually stop in this place on New Years eve.  They also sometimes sell torchy's tacos and some of the best biscotti I've had.

The staff is cool shit, too. Very friendly, unlike how elitist coffeehouse staff has become over the years, that has allowed for a very welcoming, comfortable place to enjoy a nice cup of hot Jamaican Rooibson or White Peony tea.  A cool theatre sits in the back of the shop where you'll find music or improv almost daily. There's a theatre upstairs, but I never made it too far from the couch by the window. ", pos

The Hideout Coffeehouse ," 4/5/2012 I approached the counter with Heather L. and asked the barista what I should order if I wouldn't be able to enjoy this Austin establishment for a while because my physical being would be in another state. He gave an excellent recommendation of the espresso rocket ($4.85) because a) Amy's Ice Cream is local, and b) Katz Coffee is in Houston. It was also /very/ effective at keeping me awake after dinner: like a woman on speed, I proceeded to stay up for way too many hours cleaning and working. (The barista also took the time to give me some handy advice since he turned out to have also lived where I'm planning to move to.) Heather got the Almond Joy and was correctly warned to steer clear of the special of the day (Sea Salt & Caramel Latté): the Almond Joy was so delicious.  As we sat by the window enjoying our drinks and each other's company, we noticed the interesting things on the walls and ceiling (e.g., several human head sculptures high up on the wall, a doll in a Tarzan get-up hanging from the ceiling). And a bizarre, repurposed school bus labeled ""Interstellar Communication"" and a platform with a railing on top of it drove up and down Congress outside. Yes, there was a band of some sort on the bus's platform, and some guy hanging out the bus's front door. Thanks to the Hideout's large front window, we were quite entertained.  The verdict: I'm going to miss the Hideout. It's definitely a place that is very Austin even as downtown is getting more and more Californian. Keep up the good work! The espresso rocket kept me up for more than eight hours. ", pos

The Hideout Coffeehouse ," 3/5/2012 For those who don't know, the Hideout Coffeehouse is a completely separate business from the Hideout Theater upstairs.  Maybe it's just for liability reasons but it's an interesting split.  Friendly baristas knows their stuff and they'll try to accommodate any request.  I'm really just happy that they can squeeze out delicious shots of espresso to wake me up before (improv) class. Thanks hideout-coffee-guy!  The Hideout is a overlooked bastion of Austin's coffee culture.  A little bit shabby, a little bit chic, a lot of homey and a warm feeling like you're wrapped in a big coffee shop blanket.  The Coffeehouse acts as a concession stand / waiting room / lobby for the Hideout theater.  As with most coffeehouses these days, the Hideout also had a pretty good selection of beers, sandwiches, local pastries, bars, and sweets.  The only criticism I have is that their particular Guinness selection (bottle stout, no nitrogen) is probably the worst variety.  C'mon guys, serve the nitrox cans and a pint glass already! ", pos

It's a little worn, a little musty, you get some sketch characters in there sometimes; BUT it's got the best drinks, the best atmosphere, that ""welcome home"" feeling you only get from local Austin places.    DRINKS & SERVICE: Excellent I stroll in here 2-3 mornings a week.  Jackie and Michael are usually working.  They promptly get me my El Pachon (their light roast coffee) with skim milk.  If Jason D. (current check-in Duke here) is with me, Jackie only questions whether he would like a medium or large today, and then she whips up the best iced vanilla latte in town.  There's a new kid that usually works weekends who also makes a mean latte (I usually get my hot almond-flavored latte with skim when he's working).  Recently,since I'm cutting back on caffeine, I even braved the DECAF coffee.  It's got a strong chocolatey flavor and is actually really good.  Yes, that's right, the decaf coffee is good, I said that. (Though I still need one cup of my El Pachon, yum).  FOOD: Good enough Sometimes I get a scone (doesn't hold a candle to Cake and Spoon, or Waltons, but I still find myself craving them (read: sugar addict)); sometimes I get an amazing Migas and Avocado breakfast taco ala Torchy's Tacos.  (All the tacos are vegetarian.  For meat ones, go to Royal Blue next door).  The muffins and wraps are good too.  I don't really come here for the food specifically, but I still enjoy it.  DECOR/ATMOSPHERE: It's got character, definitely. I love the ever-changing artwork. The pink chairs and the long orange bench are a little gross.  And I wish  there were power strips coming out from under the orange benches so I wouldn't have to crawl under them to plug in my laptop. But it's comfortable enough for me to sit there for hours on end video editing.   This is a GREAT place to work, until around 6pm when the improv crowd starts showing up.  Man, those people are LOUD.  I wouldn't call this place quiet, but I can easily ignore (even enjoy) some music and the casual coffee house conversation.  But when it's time for improv classes to start, it's time for me to pack up my laptop. And I almost forgot, the bathrooms are clean and full of interesting graffiti that gets reset every so often.  It's an extension of the overall Hideout vibe of self-expression.  Also, FREE WIFI!! ", pos

The Hideout Coffeehouse ," 2/26/2010 I came to The Hideout on a Thursday night to see an Improv ""Threefer.""  The coffeeshop part when you enter has a familiar and comfortable vibe. The barristas were both very nice though I didn't buy anything. I went to the box office and purchased a ticket, which was only $3. I arrived at 7:45 and the show started at 8pm, so I sat in the café until it was time to go upstairs to the theatre. There also appeared to be a music stage downstairs...I didn't go to that show, but the sound quality was fantastic. They called us up- we trekked up the stairs to a small room with a stage and a cityscape set. Three different comedy troupes performed improv (much of which was based on audience suggestion).  Overall, it was a really fun way to spend the evening if you're not a big drinker but want to be around nightlife. Inside the Hideout ", pos

Lucky Lab Coffee ," 11/14/2016 Their truck comes to my office building a couple of afternoons a week and has been for a good while, but I just recently tried them for the first time. I absolutely love their Honey Chai, hot with nonfat milk. It is the perfect amount of sweet and spicy. I could drink this everyday. The price is on average with everywhere else, they get the temp just perfect so you can sip within minutes of getting it. I've also had their rice krispy treat, it was a huge piece and really fresh tasting like it had just been cut.  I'd say I'm going to try some other drinks, but I don't know if I can break myself away from the Honey Chai! Well done y'all! ", pos

But if you come for the caffeine boost, you'll return for the service and friendly baristas who remember you!

Everything is SO GOOD. It took me way too long to write this review and share this joy with everyone.  My favorite would definitely be the lavender rose mocha - this drink only has a slight fragrant taste that is not overbearing at all which I have experienced with many other flower-type lattes at other places.  I have not tried any of their baked goods yet but they seem delicious as well! Some of their baked goods are homemade and they also have some from Upper Crust Bakery - an amazing bakery. I am so happy they made a home in Space 24 Twenty - a convenient place to stop by on my way to class or on my way back to my apartment. I am already a regular and you should be one too!!

Lucky Lab Coffee ," 5/15/2015 This lovely little coffee shop on wheels started coming by my office park last Friday in the mornings.  I don't drink a ton of coffee, but I love to drink chai in the morning given the opportunity.  It's not really conducive for me to make a proper cup of chai at my office and microwaved water in your tea really sucks. really really sucks. I stopped by last Friday morning and had their house chai and my Friday was all the better for it.  It was so nice to drink a good cup of what tasted like properly steeped tea with just the right amount of sweetness blended with spice.  This morning it was raining and i thought..well no chai for me..but what do i see but that truck sitting out there in the rain. This morning I had the honey drizzled chai and on such a gloomy morning this really brightened the day.  My one regret was today i didn't get the awesome cinnamon chip muffin I had last week.  I ate the entire thing over the morning. it was so moist and perfectly complemented the chai I was drinking. I won't make that mistake again.  If you have the opportunity to get a drink from this mobile coffee truck don't even hesitate.  These guys have basically any milk or non-dairy product you could want in your beverage of choice and their menu appears to be pretty extensive.  I can't comment on the taste of the coffee since I haven't sampled it, but i would hazard to guess that's pretty good too..just from the aroma emanating from the truck. ", pos

Cream Whiskers ," 11/22/2016 1 check-in Cream Whiskers is definitely one of those places that receives criticisms and tagged as ""overrated,"" so I avoided trying this place for a while. However, when I finally tried it after three years, I was mad at myself for never giving it a chance before.  First, aesthetics. I was with a group of friends when we stopped by, so I recieved a chance to see and taste the variety of flavors at one go. Each cream puff contains a pastel color, that suits each flavor of whipped cream, custard or cheesecake filling. While the color of the cream is already alluring enough, the choux pastry has beautiful shades of light and dark brown that complements the filling. Each flavor also has their respective toppings. For the ""Matcha Azuki"", they added azuki red bean paste and a dulce de leche drizzle, for the ""Fresh Strawberry"", they added whipped cream, strawberries and belgium chocolate ganache, and so on. And if that isn't enough, they complete the order by sprinkling some confetti sugar on top, (for ""Tiramisu"" it was cocoa powder.)  While aesthetics and plating is important, so is taste! I ordered the ""Matcha Azuki."" I love matcha, but I'm always super sketical to order an item that contains matcha, since it's difficult to execute it correctly. I'm also a bit wary of red bean paste too. I love the taste, but it's hard for me to get over the texture when it contains a bit of the beans. So I was a little disappointed when they did have the beans in the paste (Side Note: This is just me being super picky! Most of the red bean desserts come with small pieces of the beans inside. I'm just super weird when it comes to textures and you will probably notice that in my reviews.) but I was surprised at how well the flavors all worked together! I didn't think the matcha and red bean paste pairing was unusual, since it's actually super common. What I was surprised about was the Dulce De Leche drizzle. Initially I thought it was strange, but the flavor didn't overpower the main flavors so it was an enjoyable pairing.  Eating the whole thing isn't difficult. There is a variety of flavors packed into one item, that even after the third bite, you still enjoy the taste. And yet, the flavors do not fight against another and it's not too heavy. This is super important! There are some dessert places that immediately drag you down after you finished it. However, since it is cream puffs, it's already light to begin with. But even with adding all the extra ingredients, it's still not too heavy to eat after dinner.  Definitely stop by this place if you haven't given it a try! Don't let the ""it's too overrated"" comment stop you. I know I learned my lesson to try things out before you completely trust someone's opinion. Also a bonus for UT students: This place is pretty close to the campus and it's a nice, quiet place to study. However, just like other places, the restaurant itself is small and can only contain, at most, about 30 people. So if you want to study, get there early, if you can wake up.

My ministry has the time slot on Mondays at 7 pm it's very nice and peaceful~ anywho! Yah I really like the strawberry, Oreo, and matcha cream puffs though, but don't really like the new cookies they added. Coffee is big and good!

Cream Whiskers ," 6/16/2016 1 check-in Highly recommend cream whiskers! Affordable light desserts! Freshly baked handmade cream puffs are so delicious, on top of that you can choose from cookie top or original. Cookie top is a bit more flavorful, sweeter and crunchier. Go with original if you want something more traditional.  Lots of flavors: cookie n creak (too sweet). My favorites are mango, vanilla whip, strawberry cream cheese, fresh strawberry and matcha.  The shop is pretty small, space is limited but very cozy. Lots of tea choices and coffee!  Ps. They make your cream puffs in front of you, so it might take a while.

Cream Whiskers ," 4/24/2016 2 check-ins Mind. Blown.  We decided to check this place out on a whim 'cause it looked interesting; really representative of the unique eats that Austin has to offer. The hus-bae seemed reluctant at first, but as soon as we opened their door, the gorgeous smell of freshly baked puffed pastries wafting through the air nearly had us floored. They offer their ""puffs"" in an original and cookie-top variety. I do believe the cookie-top is priced about $0.50 extra? Nonetheless, we ended up with 3 cream puffs after contemplating over all the different permutations and combinations we could have.  Mango cream puff on original: To DIE for. Excellent quality delicate puffed pastry with a delightfull tasting mango flavored cream cheese filling. The cream puff was oh so delicately sweetened with the just the right hint of tartness from the cream-cheese based filling. Topped off with a mango drizzle, this was perfection in a puff.  Brown butter pecan on original: Light and airy, the cream filling was so delicately flavored with hints of brown butter and pecans, topped off with what I believe was a brown sugar drizzle?  Fresh strawberry on cookie-top: The combination of fresh sweet strawberries and fresh cream filling is perfection. They finish this one with a chocolate drizzle. What's not to love?  I can't wait to take the next out-of-town friends that decide to visit us to this place! I love showing off the awesome eats we have access to living here in the ATX :) Mango Matcha Azuki Fresh strawberry. See all photos from Mrs. Arati S. for Cream Whiskers ", pos 
Cream Whiskers ," 4/17/2016 2 check-ins What an absolutely fantastic find by my wife..!! Creampuffs, she knows this is my weakness when it comes to desserts. After wonderful date night at Shabu, we were looking for something that was light but flavorful to satisfy our sweet craving.  The front entrance is tiny and so is the storefront, but as soon as my wife opened the door, the wonderful fragrance of freshly baked creampuffs filled the air.  The mango creampuff was my absolute favorite, I would definitely have that one over and over and over again.  They have a nice relaxed atmosphere in the store, something that goes with the Austin vibe.  I will definitely come back to try the other flavors and keep exploring more of the wonderful offerings this place has to offer.

Cream Whiskers ," 8/1/2016 1 check-in Listed in A Taste of Asia and the Islands, Steepin' in Green Tea, There's No Place Like Home, How Sweet It Is! Once upon a time, Eric R. drove me to Pasadena, CA for the Texas at UCLA game a month after we got married (so I definitely knew he loved me, he is an Aggie!) - anyway, I had learned about Beard Papa on Travel Channel and called over 20 locations in LA trying to find matcha flavored cream.  It happened to be in Pasadena so we went there and I suppose I was happy but not necessarily overwhelmed.  Remember 10 Things I Hate About You, ""Can you ever just be whelmed?""  I found out about Cream Whiskers in a ""100 places to eat/drink in Austin"" blog post, and here I was melting away in the Texas heat, with about 15 minutes to get to the bus stop I needed to catch a bus to make everything in my schedule work.  I got to Cream Whiskers, and the kind staff person explained what the deal is.  I ordered an original puff with matcha filling, which technically includes sweetened azuki beans, matcha cream, and a generous drizzle of dulce de leche over the top plus a dusting of powdered sugar.  She took my money, gave me the indulgence to go, and I hoofed it several blocks in my high wedges and got on the bus.  Luckily, the ingredients she used were refrigerated and held up in my heated frenzy.  I was in cream puff heaven on the bus, where I probably was not allowed to eat it.  The matcha was soooooo green-tea-grassy (in a good way) and the combination of red bean and dulce de leche with it was great.  The cream puff also held up and was not soggy.  I will be back, and there are many other flavors to try but I may just stick with matcha azuki!!!  Itadakimasu! ", pos 
Cream Whiskers ," 5/12/2016 4 check-ins Listed in Just A Spoonful of Sugar I love Cream Whiskers for their cute atmosphere, convenient location for UT students, and of course their cream puffs.  My favorite flavors are the matcha azuki (matcha AND red bean? Yes pls) and the mango cheesecake. I always prefer the cheesecake flavors over the regular whipped ones because it's thicker and oh so delicious.  In terms of drinks, I like their chai lattes but NOT their matcha latte. The iced matcha latte tasted super powdery, and there were even some big chunks of matcha powder floating on the top.  You can collect stars when you pay with your card, and after you've collected 10 you get a reward on your next purchase!  My complaints would be that the cream puff is kind of small, so it's gone pretty quickly unless you eat like a cat. Also, availability of outlets and seating is dismal. I would like to study here, but good luck finding a seat! Tiramisu Cream Puff ", pos 
Cream Whiskers ," 8/30/2016 The cream puffs here are really good and they're definitely Instagram worthy too! I actually wish I had a bigger appetite to finish my cream puffs, but it was too big for me to finish.  I ordered the tiramisu cheesecake cream puff with a cookie top! The tiramisu and cheesecake flavors complemented each other pretty well, while the cookie top gave it a nice texture to it! I liked the pirouette cookie bit that garnished the cream puff, because it made it a lot nicer to take pics of. I believe it cost about ~5-6 bucks for a cream puff, which is a little on the pricey side from what I'm used to, but it's big and filling so I guess you're getting your money's worth ^_^  I also liked the decor of the place. It's trendy and very hip!  I think it seems like a pretty good study spot as well. ", pos 
Cream Whiskers ," 3/7/2016 1 check-in I feel so sad that this place has been open for so long and I have not even ventured over this way. Like Celine Dion song, bucket of cream puffs, and tears sort of sad.  We ordered 6 of these behemoths of the dessert world just to get a sample of all the flavors. The mango flavor ranked high up with the brown butter pecan. The strawberry looked good but my 3 year old niece defended her territory like a grizzly defending her cubs. Personally, the Matcha Azuki (Green Tea) puff was my leave favorite.  The option of the cookie crust left me inundated with too many options and I broke down like a robot. I don't know what else I'll be eating because each option has me drooling. ", pos 
Cream Whiskers ," 7/17/2016 2 check-ins One of my favorite dessert places in Austin. Basically a pastry filled with cream/custard filling in a variety of different flavors, including matcha, strawberries and cream, mango and cookies and cream. My favorite has probably been the tiramisu, which I believe was a seasonal flavor and not served year round. Every cream puff I have gotten has been played beautifully. I really appreciate the attention to detail the staff has. There are also a variety of espresso and tea drinks available as well. Great place for a quick dessert near UT.

Cream Whiskers ," 1/9/2016 1 check-in I think this was actually the first cream puff I've ever had. Although I don't have much to compare it to, I know that Cream Whiskers delighted my tastebuds for sure.  The inside of the store is somewhat small, but there were enough tables, couches, and chairs to comfortably fit the few patrons that were there when we visited. It looks a lot like a coffee shop inside. Appropriate, since they serve coffee. To order a cream puff you first choose if you want the original cream puff pastry shell, or the cookie top pastry shell. Don't be scared of the cookie shell, it's actually airy enough so that when you cut into it, your cream in the middle doesn't get smooshed all over the place. After you choose your pastry shell, you pick what kind of cream you want. There are a variety of whipped creams, cream cheese based creams, custard cream, and a frozen cream.  I went with an original shell, strawberry cream cheese cream, and requested a chocolate drizzle on top (they have drizzles too). Boyfriend got cookie top, and buttered pecan whipped cream, which came with some sort of caramel drizzle. We also got a Belgian hot chocolate to share. Everything was delicious. The whipped cream wasn't too light either, like I was concerned it would be. Strawberry Cream Cheese Cream Puff with Chocolate Drizzle Added ", pos 
Cream Whiskers ," 9/28/2016 Sometimes, you just medal for trying. A for effort. Thanks for competing. Cream Whiskers is unfortunately, pretty ordinary.  What brought me to the door was the hype revolving around the cream puff pastry that is so original to this joint. It was so prettily packaged and so beautifully photogenic that I just had to come back to give it a chance. The matcha azuki as it is titled is matcha green tea and red bean cream sandwiched between an airy puff pastry cut in half. It was drizzled with caramel sauce and topped off with powdered sugar. All the prettiness it flouted could not entice me to return and dish out another $5 for the experience. I do give the cream some points for being light and refreshing in spite of the sugary calories. The pastry itself left much to be desired, seemingly baked much in advance. Stale would be too harsh of a description, but definitely not fresh.  The drip coffee is pretty bland. Caffeine content seems to be pretty lackluster. Flavor was pretty unremarkable, forgettable. The cold brew iced coffee can only boast of having the missing caffeine boost the drip coffee lacked. The only redeeming drink was the matcha latte on ice, which was sweet and tasty.  The space is quaint and cute with hues of yellow and brown. Plenty of outlet options are spread through the shop. Good study atmosphere.  Would I return? Probably not. But at least, parking is free in the Quarters Garage with validation. ", neutral 
Cream Whiskers ," 6/18/2016 1 check-in A must when I go to Austin since Houston doesn't have a decent creampuff bakery yet. On my first ever visit I tried the fresh strawberry flavor with the cookie top and fell in love with Creamwhiskers. Be sure to try the cookie top - the normal cream puff top pales in comparison to this crunchy alternative.  Most recently, my boyfriend and I tried the mango flavor. I love all things mango but was left a little disappointed because it was really a mango cheesecake. I also ordered three other creampuffs to-go but by the time we got back to Houston, the cookie top was mushy and no good. Bummer. Maybe I should have kept the box open? Either way - I'll be back but will stick to the fresh strawberries flavor. ", neutral 
Cream Whiskers ," 11/2/2016 Good modern atmosphere. There are lots of undergrads studying inside so it might be hard to find a seat at nights. I tried green tea flavor and it was delicious.

Their cream puffs are MUCH better now than before, and all the flavors are great! The teas continue to be good and I still love the quaint atmosphere. The only thing is, I think their coffee quality has gone down, but it's still very satisfying and better compared to some of the other coffee places.

Cream Whiskers ," 9/15/2015 2 check-ins I LOVE Cream puffs. LOVE them. I went here because it's been long enough since I've heard about them to give them a try. I got 3 puffs. The Matcha, the strawberry and the OG.  I did not like the Matcha at all! It had red beans? green beans? I don't know what type of beans at the bottom. I did not enjoy it at all. The filling/cream was ok. It was matcha flavor but it wasn't the best.  The strawberry, I got it without chocolate drizzle b/c I'm not a big chocolate fan. It was fine. It's a whipped cream, not a custard cream so I was once again disappointed.  I'm so glad I got an original!! It's just what I wanted. It's a custard cream that's the traditional filling for cream puffs. I love that it's full of cream so almost every bit had a balance of pastry and cream. I will be back!

Cream Whiskers ," 4/20/2016 Holy wowsers! I saw this bakery on a yelp weekly email today and tried it out. I was blown away. I don't even like cream puffs, but did not read the description of the bakery too carefully, so there i was. I tried the fresh strawberry reluctantly, expecting cream like i've had in the past where it tastes like Kool Whip and margarine, but it was AMAZING. It was exactly like the best possible strawberry shortcake you've ever had. The cream was as if you freshly whipped heavy cream at home in your mixer.  I am a very food oriented person and an experienced home cook and baker and let me tell you, this dessert was PERFECT. And I do not say the word perfect often. Just go here. This is more of a creampufferry than a bakery. They just have these creampuffs. Regular and cookie top. Get the cookie top. Fresh strawberry ", pos 
Cream Whiskers ," 12/7/2015 ""So I read about the place which will pipe in different flavored cream and even ice cream into a choux pastry..you know like Beard Papa.."" was the beginning of a conversation with friends as we were planning an eating session in Austin...""Wait, whaaaat??""  So of course after a day of eating off we went to Cream Whiskers.  Tiny space and packed with hangers (you know people who buy one puff and hang out for 2 hours) and an overworked employee greeted us. But all was very pleasant overall.  Ordered the macha-adzuki bean puff, affogato and ice cream filled puff.  The macha was a pleasant surprise because it really tasted strongly like macha but the adzuki was just a gentle hint of a schmear at the bottom of the pastry which really needed to be ramped up to make a difference.  The ice cream and coffee were just fine.  Overall I thought the choux pastry has started losing its crispness already, but was still a pretty good eat.    They need some new and interesting flavors (jalapeno and pineapple perhaps? jalapeno jam at the bottom of the puff with pineapple cream?? ) to jack it up a notch, but good eats.

Cream Whiskers ," 6/19/2015 A place to satisfy those cream puff cravings.. enter Cream Whiskers!!  I am a big fan of cream puffs, always and forever will be! The ones I had before were from Beard Papa's and ones in Japan. But CW definitely hit the spot. We came here on a hot weekday afternoon. The place was rather quiet, but I'm sure that has a lot to do with the fact that school is out, but nonetheless CW is a cozy place to hang out/study/relax. Street parking only - well the same goes for anywhere around UT.  Now the good part - We ordered two puffs, the regular puff x matcha with azuki beans & the cookie puff x lavender vanilla and prickly pear icecream (yes, comes with two scoops of icecream!).  The two different puff shells honestly tasted very similar, but I would have to say the regular puff does it better for me. The regular puff is light and chewy, but I would have preferred it to be more fluffy. On the other hand, the cookie puff, didn't give even a slight ""crunch"" factor at all. So I would say go with the regular puff. The matcha cream paired well with the azuki beans and had just enough sweetness. While, the prickly pear icecream (get that if available) is delicious!!  Overall, great selection of cream/icecream puffs! I will definitely venture back to this place again.

Cream Whiskers ," 7/21/2016 Shared a matcha cream puff with a friend - last time I had the matcha cream puff a year ago, and it's definitely changed, in taste and appearance.  It used to be much sweeter (probably due to the sauce drizzled over it, which wasn't on my cream puff today) and bigger. Today's cream puff was a baby compared to what I had before. I preferred today's lighter sweetness. However, I noticed the prices have gone up...I'm not sure it's worth it for the price.  Ehh, it's close to campus, so I might stop by in the future if I'm craving a cream puff. It's aight. ", neutral 
Cream Whiskers ," 4/30/2015 4 check-ins Love this place! Such a quiet and intimate place to hang out or even just do homework. I think the cream puffs and the drinks here in general are all very carefully handmade, and a lot of thought goes into each one. I love their seasonal menu, and I think it's so cool that they change their menu every now and then. This is definitely one of my go to dessert places, and one that you will not find anywhere else.  I had the brownie chocolate cookie cream puff and a latte, and I think that drinking coffee with cream puffs just balances really well. I think any of their flavors for the cream puffs are all good, but I saw that a lot of people really liked the tiramisu. I think the cookie outer layer is better with its crispy and sweet texture, but I do have a sweet tooth, so it might not be for everyone. I will definitely be back for more!

Cream Whiskers ," 10/18/2015 1 check-in Cream Whiskers is the trendiest dessert cafe on campus. Not only is the location convenient (about a block away from campus, and in the dead middle of West Campus) but it is cute and comfortable, and there is plenty of seating for a small group of friends. I wouldn't recommend coming here if you're in a large group but they do cater and you can reserve the space as well.  The fresh strawberry cream puff is by far the most popular- and for good reason. It's a vanilla whip with fresh strawberries and topped with a chocolate ganache. Get it on the cookie top (a sweeter, more crunchy version of the original puff) and you're gold.  I also recommend the lavender ice cream if you want something cold and sweet! The cheesecake flavors aren't my favorite, but I'm not big on cream cheese, and they are cream cheese based.  Cream Whiskers also has a large drink menu - the chai lattes are extremely popular. You can get anything hot or iced, and they serve amazing cold brew. I recommend the elephant vanilla iced chai latte or the hazelnut iced cold brew latte.  It's also a wonderful place to study in the afternoons - it opens at 1 pm so you can spend your afternoon catching up on work after class. And in the evenings, it's a great place for a social outing with friends - there is outside seating too for you to chill.  I definitely recommend trying this place if you're a UT student - or in Austin looking for a place to have dessert. It's unique and cute and their items are all really great (and look great for instagram, too) ", pos

Cream Whiskers ," 9/30/2015 1 check-in Listed in Places to study in ATX/HTX I'm really impressed that Cream Whiskers has continued to improve itself. The cream puffs have always been the key selling point, but CW now validates parking in nearby Quarters Garage, has plenty of outlets, plays music at the right volume, and offers GREAT iced coffee.  There are a ton of flavors of cream puffs to choose from, so odds are you'll find at least one that you'll like (if not many). You can even customize it with a ""cookie top"", although I feel it's unnecessary - the original ""top"" is just as delicious.  This is a great place for both getting work done and catching up with a friend, but I do have two complaints: wifi is inconsistent, and the cream puffs are a bit more expensive than what I would prefer to pay.

My best friend and I ordered a Mocha, Vanilla Latte, and Original Puff with Cookies and Cream filling. The Original puff was very light and fluffy! I'm so glad I got that instead of the cookie puff because otherwise the combination would have been overwhelmingly sweet with the cream filling. The cookies and cream filling was very smooth. It had the perfect consistency and was very light, but it didn't necessarily taste like cookies and cream. I think it could use some more flavor. The vanilla latte I had and the mocha my friend had were very bland. It tasted like we were drinking straight milk. The interior and atmosphere of Cream Whiskers was a little awkward. It seems like a fine place to study, but the cashier was just a little hard to talk to, not that she was mean, just not very sociable.

I've spent at least 50% of my undergrad in this place -- and I can't list all the great things about it, but I will try, because this place deserves a visit if you're ever around UT campus.  Puffs (from my most favorite to least): Cookies n Cream (cheesecake filled with an Oreo on top, get it, you won't regret it), Fresh Strawberry (cheesecake again, you're seeing the trend here), Strawberry (you can't go wrong with plain strawberry), Choco-whip Brownie (it's a little on the sweeter side), and Vanilla (honestly it was kind of bland).  Drinks: I'm really picky with my coffee - but this place is always a hit or miss. I've tried a variety of their flavored lattes, and I think the iced caramel one is my favorite, BUT it really depends on who the barista of the day is...  BTW, they now have ice-cream puffs?? It's worth a try, but I think I'm going to stick with the original ones.  Misc: There's a good number of metered parking spots on the side, and tons of outlets for your electronic devices, and the seating isn't that bad although it does get quite busy when school is in session.

There's a good amount of variety and they also have a seasonal menu every once in a while.  Each cream puff comes with the option of the regular cream puff shell or a crispier, cookie-like shell. My sister and I purchased 3 cream puffs and had the regular puff shell on them (Fresh Strawberry, Chocowhip Brownie, and Cookies & Cream). All of them were great, but a bit sweet.  Store gives off a cute coffee-shop vibe, and is also a lot more than just cream puffs. I also saw options for cheesecakes and espressos.

Cream Whiskers , 5/4/2015 Adorable place! Wish this was here when I was at UT. Ambiance is ideal for a study environment and it's close to most apartments in West Campus.    Brown sugar pecan was my fav! Fresh strawberry was good as well. The cookie top and regular puff are both good but I would get the cookie top with a lighter flavor inside to balance out the sweetness. The coffee was also good and the price is great for the sizes offered.  They have some pretty interesting flavors like mango and matcha so I'll be back to try these next time I'm in Austin! Hope they expand! , pos 
Cream Whiskers ," 10/28/2015 1 check-in The pictures of the delicious cream puffs will draw you in alone. At least it did for me! A small coffee shop serving puff pastries filled with, my favorite, whipped cream. It's a small and quaint little place. Lots of students studying with their laptops and study groups. Couple of guys on the couch playing games. Plenty of counter space near the window to sit. We stopped by and got some coffee. Delicious. Got 2 different cream puffs. Birthday cake and fresh strawberry. Definitely wanted more but resisted. I will definitely be back to try the cookie topped puff. This is a must stop by place if in Austin for a nice treat.

Cream Whiskers ," 9/30/2015 5 check-ins I think I have a problem, since I rate bakeries and coffee shops relatively highly compared to other restaurants. It just so happens that Cream Whiskers is a cream puff bakery AND a coffee shop. Brace yourself for ridiculous amounts of praise.  First off, the cream puffs are delicious. Are they worth the $3-5? Probably not, but #TreatYoSelf, haha. I think Mango might be my favorite, but I also love and recommend Cookies & Cream, Tiramisu, and Fresh Strawberry. Next time I go, I'm definitely trying the ice cream kind; will update this when I do!  The coffee is good enough in my opinion. I'm sure it's not professional coffee roaster quality, but I like it more than Starbucks and anywhere else close to campus. I think it's a lighter blend, but don't quote me on that. My friend had the tea, and he said it was a little watered down, so I guess I wouldn't recommend that.  The study environment is the best part. There is an abundance of outlets--I only wish there was more space! Service is always friendly, even though it's mostly student run.  Will be back to study for the rest of the semester!

Cream Whiskers ," 7/16/2015 1 check-in I've been dying to try Cream Whiskers. I'm totally not a ""dessert person"" but this particular treat struck my fancy. We arrived just before close and though they were out of ice cream puffs, they still had matcha, tiramisu, strawberry cheesecake and brown butter pecan.  I chose the latter and my two friends got strawberry cheescake. For those of you who have tried frozen creampuffs, those are not these. These are hollowed out cupcake looking things that they squeeze fresh cream-based fillings in. And you can get a cookie version. And they dribble stuff on it and add a little cute garnish.  Next time I'll try a smaller one and maybe do the ice cream thing. I wanted mine to have a bit more of a savory bite to it for balance but overall, this is one of the most unique desserts in the city right now. ", pos

Not saying that men don't go to this establishment (I have seen a few), but with its decor, cute cream puffs, and soft color palette, the ladies are bound to flock to Cream Whiskers.  They feature fluffy cream puffs filled with varying flavors of custard or cream. All the flavors I've tried are amazing, but my go-to is the brown butter pecan. Their drinks are superb. I love their matcha tea, chai tea... basically all their teas.  My only qualm is their hours. I wish they opened before lunch, especially since they serve coffee. Plus, it gets crazy crowded during the school year after 2-3pm that sometimes I can't find a seat. I would totally come to campus to work more often if they opened earlier! Hint hint.

I discovered this place during a recent tour of West Campus and came upon it after needing a sweet-fix post-coffee. How has this place not taken over Austin!?!  It's cream puffs, but like ""say what!?!"" cream puff flavors and you can even get a cookie top on said cream puff!?!?! I cannot stress enough that everything as in EVERYTHING Is an insta-""GET IN MY MOUTH"" situation!  It was sophie's choice (otherwise I would have instantly put on 100lbs if I had ordered everything I wanted), but I went with the Matcha Azuki sub chocolate drizzle because it seemed like the most unique flavor. It really was incredible, especially with the cookie top! Seriously, it was amazing!!! I paired it with a green tea chai (which was INCREDIBLE) and I was one happy woman!  You can definitely tell the quality of the ingredients used (especially in the chai), so I didn't mind that both my cream puff and my chai came to $8 because it was not only satisfying, fulfilling, and delicious, but everything about the experience was worth the price tag!

Cream Whiskers ," 2/9/2016 1 check-in I had the regular crust with the whip cream and fresh strawberries. Yum.

It was a pretty expresso colored shirt so I was like why not! My friend enjoyed her butter pecan flavored cream puff but it was a bit too sweet for her.

Cream Whiskers ," 6/4/2015 While on a super rare break from my gluten free diet, I came here with the hubby for a dessert. I got a cookie top puff with whipped cream and strawberries. Small, simple, tasty- not overly sweet.  Not sure super this is my kind of dessert, but I appreciated all the different flavors and combos. If I come again will try with ice cream.

Cream Whiskers ," 5/3/2015 2 check-ins I'm proud to say that I've tried every single flavor at Cream Whiskers!! This place is just too cute to resist not buying something every time I pass by it. My two favorite flavors are the Matcha Azuki and Strawberry Cheesecake! I don't think there's much of a difference between the original top and the cookie top cream puffs except cookie tops are slightly crunchier, so you can save your $0.50.  I also got the iced green tea latte. The drink tastes like creamy green tea. If there's espresso in it (which I assume so, because it's a ""latte""), I couldn't taste it. But it's still super good! Great choice for tea lovers who want a latte experience.  They tend to run out of more popular flavors (such as mango cheesecake) throughout the day, so go earlier if you want the complete menu! The only reason Cream Whiskers doesn't get 5 stars is because the cream puffs are honestly too expensive (around $3 to $4 each). ", pos

I've tried the iced ginger peach black tea and iced sunburst green tea, both of which I liked. Next time I want to pair my cream puff with a latte!  I think Cream Whiskers is a nice quiet little place to hang out with friends or even study because there are plenty of tables inside and outside.

Cream Whiskers ," 2/27/2016 Cream puffs are adorable and I think I'm predisposed to like them. That being said, I've tried three different flavors from here: the mango cheesecake, the matcha azuki, and the simple cookie top shell and vanilla bean custard. None of them really blew me away, and I think I went back a few times because I really wanted to like them more than I actually do. Also cream puffs are a pretty neat dessert alternative to froyo or ice cream or doughnuts. The prices themselves aren't bad, but the prices for the amount of satisfaction I got were a little steep.  The mango was the best of the flavors I tried, the matcha azuki was okay but kind of mild to actually taste anything besides cream, and the vanilla bean custard was a disappointment. I mean the custard itself was amazing, but I only got a tiny dribble inside the puff itself so I mostly just ended up eating a plain shell.  Inside was a pretty chill environment- fine to go with friends or just to hang out by yourself for a while and pretend to be fancy while you nibble on cream puffs and sip some tea. ", neutral

Cream Whiskers ," 10/15/2014 1 check-in The signature cream puffs were great and the atmosphere was chill, but I still can't believe how expensive a single cream puff was. The cheapest one, the original vanilla cream puff, was already $2.50 each and the rest was even more expensive. Sure, I could taste the high-quality ingredients that were used in creating the cream puffs, but I just don't see why the price has to be this high.  If you don't mind spending substantial money for quality dessert, Cream Whiskers is a great place for an afternoon tea location or an after-meal dessert place. I am just a cheapskate so the high price was a serious turn-off for me. Can't get any more classic than this vanilla custard cream puff ", neutral 
Cream Whiskers ," 6/24/2015 Second time here. I decided to step out of my comfort zone with Cream Whiskers. Rather than getting m all time favorite, Vanilla Elephant chai tea, I got their mocha. I wasn't too ecstatic about their mocha unfortunately. But that's okay!  As for the puffs, I stuck with the usual and got their Strawberries and Cream. Hands down my all time favorite puff from them.

But it wasn't as good as I remembered. The creams were... kind of bland and there was too much whipped cream (?!)  added.  The matcha latte definitely was NOT worth it. It might be the WORST green tea latte I've had. It was just warm--tbh lukewarm--milk with matcha powder sprinkled a bit on top.  TL;DR I was super disappointed.

If you're of those people who doesn't really get cream puffs then STOP THAT and check this place out! Whether you've got a sweet tooth or need a chill spot to meet with friends, Cream Whiskers is the definitely THE place to go. This sweet joint is great especially for UT students due to its convenient location right around the corner of campus. Cream Whiskers has really changed the game for cream puff desserts. They offer a cool variety of options from simple flavors like strawberry to unique flavors like matcha azuki. In addition, they give you a chance to go crazy with a cookie top or be a normal person and get a regular cream puff shell. I personally am I fan of ordering on the simpler side and went with the strawberry cream puff but with a cookie top. The presentation was graceful with an artistic chocolate drizzle and a sprinkle of powdered sugar. The best part however was the taste and texture. The crunchy cookie top complemented the smooth and fluffy cream with  strawberries that was sandwiched in between the cookie shell. Adding in real strawberry bits added a tartness to the sweet and fluffy cream from becoming overpowering. Overall, it was a decadent and divine experience as a first timer. It was also good to have a nice long chat with a friend in such a hip and cozy atmosphere. If you haven't already, be sure to check this place out. ", pos

This location has very friendly baristas and servers and they know their menu really well and have been able to suggest very good drinks for me, a coffee lover, my uncle who wanted a sweetened latte, and my little cousins who just wanted a sweet treat. The ""Chai Me a River"" is the one drink we've ordered time and again for the kids and adults alike especially in this warm and humid weather. It's sweet, not too rich, not very strongly tea flavored, and gets bonus points for not calling it a ""chai tea"" (THAT BASICALLY TRANSLATES TO TEA TEA!!) Another good drink for the kids - either the hot chocolate or Mexican hot chocolate spending on how experimentative they are. Neither are too sickly sweet! Now my favorite is the Frenchie - it's a simple espresso drink with lavender syrup and lavender honey and it's is hands down the best coffee I've ever had! It was very fragrant and flavorful notes without compromising the strong Java flavor. And also the cortada deserves a special mention for being a well made strong and flavorful pick me up drink!

Lola Savannah Coffee Lounge ," 6/6/2012 3 check-ins Lola Savannah, I'm not really feeling you.  Ok, I'll just say that I'm not a coffee connoisseur, so if you are then you can disregard this review.  I was looking for a nice place to study and enjoy some coffee. Honestly, I don't really know what I like so people will just make something that tastes ""light and yummy"". I know that's vague, sorry.  When you walk in it's bright at the front, but towards the back it gets quite dark and romantic. That's nice if you're with a date or wanting something cozy. There are 4ish? seats to the right and some comfy chairs to the left as you walk in. That's where all the light is. The seats in the front were taken.  I walked towards the back to find some open seating and it was very secluded. There's a big group table and then a few smaller single bar seats in the back. Again, it was very dark.  When I got my coffee it tasted... bad. I told them I like chai tea lattes? So they whipped up something fairly similar in a cold drink. Sorry, I can't say what it was. All you coffee people are laughing at me. Anyway, it's not my favorite place or my favorite coffee. But other serious coffee people seem to really like it so give it a shot!  I wouldn't say I'd never come here again, but if you like finding open and bright coffee places I'd suggest somewhere else. Maybe sipping on a glass of their wine with the boyfriend in a cozy couch in the back would be just the thing for me :) ", neutral

Lola Savannah Coffee Lounge ," 2/6/2013 This place is great. It has a more upscale cafe feel to it. I've honestly gotten used to the Austin feel of cafe's with the beat up tables that were probably found in a salvage yard to go along with the staple baristas serving all the drinks.  Those places are great and dandy but this place makes me feel a little more refined again.  It's connected to the Grove Wine Bar and Restaurant next door so if you get hungry, boom you can order from the cafe, which is pretty sweet.  Legit snacks and meals there.  Their americano is smooth as heck.  I'd come back for that.  The place is a little dark if you want to study but it's fairly quiet for the most part.  You can still see just hopefully you don't have to do too much tiny print reading.  So come to chill, eat or study.  It's a nice little discovery in the nicer part of town.  Also they have ESPN on the TV if you need some distractions.  I'll be back again. ", pos 
Lola Savannah Coffee Lounge ," 12/8/2014 50 check-ins Lola has the distinction of being attached to the Grove.  Which frankly is a good thing.  Especially after enjoying some vino at the Grove.  What's curious is they actually have really good coffee if you just happen to drop in to grab a cup of JO.  However, I haven't done that yet, so I cannot comment how that feels.  What I do know is we tend to pop in once we have finished noshing and drinking wine and always enjoy the atmosphere and a little sweet bite.  They tend to have many different options to bite on.  One nice difference is that I have never seen so many different selections of coffee offered in a shop before.  They organize them by blend, flavor, organic and origin.  Not only do they offer coffee, but have a nice selection of teas available and a high end smoothie.  Their prices may be a little steep in some areas, but the quality is there.  For me, I am not a coffee connoisseur per se, so I won't find myself hanging out here, but I am probably going to find myself dropping by in the near future. ", neutral

I guess that's what I get for growing up on Dunkin Doughnuts coffee regular. :) That said, I did have a good cup of coffee there, the atmosphere was pleasant, the food smelled great, and there was a lot of activity, so they are doing a lot of things right. Another great thing about this location is that they participate in Ground to Ground and provide their used grounds/filters to area gardeners for free. Any diversion from the landfill is good and I applaud them for putting the effort forth to run an ecologically responsible business. ", pos

It's not really in the city, but it's worth the extra five minutes for a very comfortable cup of your favorite coffee.  First and foremost, they've got some of the best espresso machines you can buy.   They look like they came from Metropolis.  They're coffee beans are roasted outside of Houston at the original Lola Savannah (which I believe is the owner's mother's place).  The baristas care about coffee and making it correctly which seems to be a fabled myth in the corporate coffee world we are surrounded by.  They're always playin' good music, the seating is spacious and very comfy and they have really good breakfast tacos and pastries.  Oh, and they're connected to The Grove so you can enjoy that great wine selection.  Serious recommendation from a fairly serious Yelper. ", pos 
Lola Savannah Coffee Lounge ," 6/6/2012 The place is nice, it pretends to be a coffee bar but actually a slightly pretentious atmosphere,  the seating is certainly comfortable.  I was very stressed and needed to get away and take a break so decided to stop in.  Having had a day slaying dragons at work, it was not fun to have a lecture from the barista.    I ordered a simple cup of coffee, they offered two sizes and I asked for a small.  What showed could have doubled as a small aquarium - I asked if this was the small which started the lecture.  The attitude-laden barista informed me there is only one size and price!  Clearly offered two on the menu so I had to ask how it could be there was only one size.  The explanation was simple, we offer one to go and one for having in the store.  Not able to stop my curiosity, I asked a simple and obvious question - why not make this clear on the menu?    The response - ""Is 50 cents really a big deal""?  Well, no yet that's not the point;  being honest in transactions is the point; suggesting a bit of help clarify their menu might a consideration, the entitlement attitude moved to an attack mode - ""so what are you, like a business god""..  My desire to find a hideaway from the workday shattered, I simply walked away and got to work.    Nice place to work away and future trips I'll simply order and move on avoiding a barista beat-down :) ", neutral 
Lola Savannah Coffee Lounge ," 2/19/2012 1 check-in Great little spot that is a refreshing alternative to the mega coffee houses. The staff was very knowledgeable, professional and the pastry was good. What bumps this place up to 5 stars for me is they know how to properly brew coffee. I always order a single espresso when I try new places because that's the only way to actually taste the raw product. Their espresso had a beautiful crema on top, was rich with a bite, yet smooth and not bitter. The coffee is well roasted and high quality, but more importantly, the baristas know what to do with it.  Additionally, I enjoy sitting in a cafe and watching the clientele. This place seemed to pull the normal crowd. The staff is very eclectic and easy on the eyes. A mix of urbanites that are hip as well as intellectual.  Overall a great first venture that has made a mark for me. I will be back. ", pos

Forgot that they have wine :)  Good wine :)  Let's see, it pretends to be a coffee bar but actually I can hide in the back and have wine and do work on my computer.  HEAVEN!

Lola Savannah Coffee Lounge ," 4/30/2012 Lola Savannah boasts a very pretentious but warm atmosphere. The decor gives off that wine bar sort of ambiance, but the menu is still no-frills, as an standard coffee shop menu should be. It is attached to the Grove, so that may shed light on why it is so uppity.  You don't technically feel like you are drinking coffee and reading Faulkner at Lola Savannah, but the seating is certainly comfortable. Additionally, I think its nice to have a little space every once in a while.  Aside from the sleek design, I think the offerings in themselves are nothing noteworthy. Simplicity is what lies behind the whole concept here, in my opinion.  If you are passing through this area of town (is West Lake Hills technically its own town?), Lola Savannah is definitely a good place to settle down and have a cup of joe, but I don't think anything stands out in particular that would make it a better choice than any other establishment.

I'd stopped by to put in some wifi time on my way home.

Lola Savannah Coffee Lounge ," 8/19/2012 4 check-ins Last month, a friend of mine was visiting Austin for an assortment of interviews during an exploratory mission for moving to Austin. For the next four days, our dialogue went pretty much like this:  Her: ...It's called an engineered strategy, and small cap and value are big focus areas for them...So, they...Nathan, are you listening?  Me: So what if Kate Middleton gets her hair blown out three times a week? Big f**king deal; you do, and there's no headline anywhere about *that*.  Her: Um...are we having the same conversation?  Me: Where are we going for lunch?  One of her more intense interviews was to take place out in Westlake, so while she was supposed to go talk shop about mutual funds and her preferred philosophy about investing rich people's money, she tasked me with the MUCH more arduous job of beginning ""50 Shades of Grey"", to be read at whatever coffee shop that was close by in which I would be waiting. Lola Savannah ended up being that fateful locale.  It's less of a coffee shop as it is an extension of The Grove Wine Bar, mostly because the two spaces are separated (maybe?) by a curtain, and the employees drifted in an out quite freely between the two. I wasn't really paying that much attention, as I was on a mission.  The place is quite spacious. It's sunny thanks to the big front windows, and while there are tables and padded wall seating for plenty of people, it never felt crowded. I parked myself at a spot along the back wall with an A/C outlet, and ordered an iced hibiscus tea.  While I would have much preferred to read ""50 Shades of Grey"" in a discrete manner such as on a Kindle, or my iPad, my friend insisted on giving me a hard copy so that I could be seen with it. To be fair, my shame did not stem from the graphic sexual content contained in the novel at all, but from what I already had heard through the grapevine was undoubtedly a horrible, shit-tastic writing job. In short, I'd rather have people in a coffee house know I was reading porn than terrible Twilight fan-fiction. In this case, it was both.  First off, the hibiscus tea was amazingly refreshing, as the perky barista had already informed me during my ordering process. I sipped on that while I flipped through my iPad edition of the latest Vanity Fair in an effort to vamp before I actually started the book. Once I'd fallen in love with a Gucci tote and read more about President Obama's romantic life in NYC than I ever cared to know about, I figured it was time to bite the bullet.  The next two hours were spent with me reading a book I felt could have been pilfered from the Trapper Keeper of a freshman highschooler who knew way too much--and yet nothing at all--about sex for her age. I'm not sure if the other patrons noticed, but my facial expressions were probably priceless, sitting there with my hibiscus tea and wondering what on God's green Earth I was reading. Who the hell says ""I was a quivering mass of female hormones""? How many times could a guy say ""Laters, baby"", without having someone kick the living shit out of him for being such a douche? In what world are there 25-year old billionaires wooing clumsy, flaky girls with Audis and helicopter rides, all while handcuffing them and whipping them in a Seattle penthouse before casually introducing her to his parents? In the middle of Lola Savannah, I decided that either this world should exist and I MUST become part of it, or this was all completely made up and therefore the stupidest book I've ever read in my life. I'm supposing, of course, it is the latter.  By the way, I think the only words I ever said out loud in Lola Savannah were ""Stop calling it a foil packet! It's called a CONDOM!"", which I screamed at my book. Luckily, no one seemed to notice. Two girls who were clearly sorority sisters from 3-4 years earlier were busy planning some stupid party with cupcakes, or poodles, or some such nonsense to even hear my completely inappropriate coffee house outburst.  In a daze of literary outrage and righteous anger that whoever wrote this drivel was a millionaire, I went back up to the counter and ordered an iced mocha. It was tasty enough, but in all honesty, the hibiscus tea seemed much more suited for a hot summer's day. And for calming me down during my ordeal.  I returned to Lola a second time, for much the same reason, and much of the same events re-occurred, except the second interview only lasted an hour. Decent coffee, nice staff.  I guess what I'm trying to tell you is that Lola Savannah is a pleasant, quiet, cute Westlake coffee shop...that I, personally, will forever associate with my experience delving into the world of ""mommy-porn"" S&M fanfiction schlock. So. Does this coffee shop make ""my insides practically contort with potent, needy, liquid, desire""? No. Would I come back? Maybe. But only if there's some sort of coffee that would make ""the muscles inside the deepest, darkest part of me clench in the most delicious fashion.""  Laters, baby.  4 Stars ", pos

But today when I went, I circled for 30 minutes and then tried valet and they were completely full and couldn't park me. So I had to leave.... No where in the entire parking area had a spot. This is a problem because now I'm at Triannon which is no bueno.

My barista hasn't stopped serving, busing, replenishing supplies and cleaning since I got here. So much cleaning. And cleaning. The blender is spotless already.  She's done more work with smile on her face, than I remember seeing anyone, anywhere.  Then there are three guys within sight just dealing with glass cleaning. One guy washing and another uber-polishing them with some fancy machine that looks like mini, rotating car wash brushes. Good job unnamed barista with the blue hair.

And they are always stocked up on the local kombucha, so that's a definite plus in these dark days of Lohan.  I'm not a big coffee drinker, but the occasional lattes I've had were yummy and had pretty designs on top.

Modern decor seemed a little upscale but found a place in the back to post for some time.  The baristas were extremely nice. Noticed we walked in with our backpacks and were curious as to what we were studying for. Waited 3 minutes for an awesome Vanilla soy latte with, to my surprise, an intricate leaf design in the foam.  Outlets were close by and convenient and the couches and chairs were comfy enough to sit in for about 3 hours. We probably could have stayed longer but were kindly informed  that a Happy Hour was taking place about 45 minutes prior to its start time, giving us plenty of time to get to a stopping point and head out.  The staff thanked us as we walked out and I immediately decided that I would love to hang out there again.

I of course say yes and when I walked in I thought NO! this place cannot have good breakfast tacos. Where are the guys in flip flops and wrinkled shirts, long sideburns and hippie girlfriends? This cant be good. I was so wrong. I ordered a cup of dark coffee,a  bacon egg and cheese taco and a bean and cheese taco. We sat down and the bacon egg and cheese taco was way better than most, served in foil on two fresh corn tortillas, I poured the dark roasted salsa over it and was in heaven. Done with that in a few minutes I turned to the filler taco- bean and cheese.  I opened it up and was pleasantly surprised to find it was a mixture of black beans whole and refried. Served on a very thin flour tortilla with cheese and some salsa mixed in. Oh sweet Lord in Heaven. It was the single best breakfast taco I have eaten in my 45 years. Bean and cheese, who knew.

Lola Savannah Coffee Lounge , 7/6/2009 We were out in the Bee Caves area today and after lunch at neighboring Jimmy Johns decided to get coffee here.    I had a soy chai and my husband had a latte.  Both were EXCELLENT and topped with lovely latte art.  The interior is funky and relaxed and the service was great.  We also enjoyed a delicious chocolate chip cookie and I'm looking forward to being out in that neighborhood again to try more of their coffee offerings.  Highly recommend! , pos

Lola Savannah Coffee Lounge ," 4/12/2010 1 check-in If you like the taste of wet cardboard, and hanging out with douchey losers, don't go to Lola Savannah.  If you do in fact enjoy fresh coffee and exceptional espresso drinks, coupled with a great atmosphere then you'll really like Lola Savannah.  Really though, the staff here is seriously exceptional!  The espresso drink art is very creative and unique.  The staff is also very cool about making creative drinks off menu.  Even putting all of that aside, the coffee is very high quality.  The atmosphere is very comfortable, clean and generally pretty cool.  It's not full of goofballs setting up a remote office there, or pissy hippies doing home work or looking up Phish shows, or couches to sleep or whatever they are doing at places like Austin Java.  It's mostly just hanging out, chatting, music, real life social interaction, and all that stuff.  I agree with some of the other reviews that the parking pretty much sucks.  If you just accept the parking sucks, and park far away, you'll get over it pretty quickly.  To be honest, I actually think the breakfast tacos suck.  It's a f'n coffee shop, not a taco store.  If you want a taco, go to ZuZu, which is right next to Lola. ", pos

As I've mentioned before, I would drink iced coffee while ice fishing in Fargo, and if Lola Savannah had a Fargo annex, I would do exactly that. This lovely little low-key lounge is attached to the Grove restaurant and wine bar, but has its own mellow ambiance. Not the spot to just pop in and grab a cup of coffee as the service is geared more to the laptop and conversation crowd. Their iced coffee is my favorite Saturday morning treat, and its location next to Lone Star Kolaches is ideal for snagging a few tasty bites for brekkie. Highly recommended! ", pos 
Lola Savannah Coffee Lounge ," 3/25/2010 Great coffee, comfy seating, and free wifi. I like it. It's a good place to relax and read. One of the best cups of coffee I've had in Austin.  The bad? The parking lot is almost always completely full so I can't even go here half of the time I want to. It takes a lot of luck just to get in the front door because of the full parking lot.  But the real reason I chopped off a whole star is that the staff is kind of rude. One guy in particular offended me so much that I wanted to splash my hot coffee into his face (I wish I'd gotten his name; I was THIS close to making a complaint to the manager about him). I go to coffee shops to relax, to read, to get work done. I go because I don't get bothered there like I do at restaurants.  So when I am here to do a LOT of work and have to stay here for like four hours, LEAVE ME ALONE. I came here on a day where I had a lot to get done and had to stay for a long time, but one guy working here kept trying to guilt trip me into buying more or leaving or something. Every time I went to the counter to order more coffee, he would say in a snotty voice ""you sure have been here a long time"". Over and over. He'd even come to the table I was doing my paperwork at and interrupt me several times with his snotty ""you sure have been here a long time"" comments, shoving a menu into my face. Was ordering a cup of coffee every hour in a near-empty room not enough to make me worthy of sitting there and doing my paperwork? I felt like I was being harassed into purchasing more and it made me feel really unwelcome.  So I like your coffee, guys, but I hope someone in charge there reads this and will remind the staff members to leave people who are planning to stay for a long time to get work done alone. ", pos

Seventh Flag Coffee Co ," 8/29/2016 2 check-ins Coffee at Seventh flag is pretty great! Definitely high quality. They serve a lot of sweet pastries as well as breakfast tacos and toast and such, so this would be a great place to stop by for breakfast as well. The service really stood out to me here as the staff were very genuine, friendly and accommodating; I wasn't sure what the pastries were exactly so the worker kindly explained each item.  I will say that their lattes are quite heavy on the milk flavor, so if that doesn't suit you, keep it in mind when you order!  The space itself is incredibly homey (it is inside an old home) and open, and very bright and well-kept. Seats have no back here, so if you're looking for somewhere super comfortable you may not like it here.

Seventh Flag Coffee Co ," 5/23/2016 1 check-in Really nice coffee shop on South 1st in Austin. The baristas are friendly and the place is kept quite immaculate. I ordered a cappuccino to keep things simple, but they have a special drink over there called the Gibraltar, which is apparently similar to a cortado. My cappuccino was quite good - not the best I've ever had, but the coffee was good and the beverage as a whole was definitely made by an expert.  A personal gripe perhaps, but most of their seating is quite communal (ie they have a couple of really large tables), which makes it awkward for people who come alone and just want to sit at their own personal table.

An extremely strong cup of coffee to go with my extremely decadent sweet and savory donut? Yes, please.  I ordered a Gibraltar, which is a double shot of espresso and a bit of milk. It was sour and bitter and dark and complicated, and when the barista topped off the milk in the shape of a heart, I was smitten.

We had ours with the homemade almond milk, which was fantastic.  The baristas were friendly, and while the place seems like it might have a pretentious pour-over coffee shop vibe, it really doesn't.

The baristas are kick-ass and friendly, and the prices were comparable to what you would find in LA. $4 cold brew is a must try and their croissants are HEAVEN. We stopped by here 3 days in a row and got a croissant every time (both plain & almond are delish). There is a small parking lot in the back, and plenty of street parking in the neighborhood.

He recommended a wet cappuccino, which normally I would not be a fan of but this one was superb. It was the best way for me to taste the creaminess of milk and the brightness of the espresso.

Seventh Flag Coffee Co ," 6/14/2015 1 check-in Listed in ATX Coffee Fix, ATX for First Timers I heard so many great things about Seventh Flag and finally had the chance to visit this weekend. Their parking spots were all taken (they probably had 5 spots total) but there was plenty of street parking on W Monroe with not a lot of traffic on that street.  Seventh has patio seating near the front and side. In terms of ambience, there was plenty of windows though it was strange to see the long table/main area not receive a lot of natural lighting--maybe it was the direction this shop was facing. In my opinion, the perfect spot at this shop is the nook where there is a small table with two stools and a couch--perfect for your Instagram photos ;).  I ordered their espresso set which came to around 3-4 dollars. The set included mineral water (Topo Chico?), espresso, and black tea that had faint hints of red fruit, particularly apple. All in all, it was a pleasant experience. On a side note, I hope they open shop at another location closer north closer to where I live. Ethiopian espresso set ", pos

Seventh Flag Coffee Co ," 10/4/2015 1 check-in Listed in 2015 Yelp 100 Challenge I have been to this coffee place twice now and I think my favorite aspect of the place is the outdoor seating with picnic tables and large, old, character-filled trees. I have gotten hot drinks both times i have been and have been pleased both times. It is nicely placed across the street from a small food truck park so you can go get tacos or a donut and then eat them while you sip on your coffee.  The inside of the coffee shop is really unique, fairly modern and grey, but it is neat. I will probably visit this shop every time i am in Austin because the quality of the coffee is so good. Also, the drinks aren't ever too hot to burn your tongue.  I think my only complaint is the offstandish attitude some of the baristas have towards patrons. ", pos

I love the preciousness of their technique when they pour a filter coffee and earnestly explain that it takes 6 minutes to make one.  The decor is Swedish minimalist. a nice respite from the tchotchke-filled Austin  aesthetic of some old time places (the neon sign store is just down S 1st street). That old decor style filled with license plates and road signs is perhaps more booze that coffee. With 7th Flag, I think Austin may be moving away from all that - and this place and ones like it are saying, ""Hey Austin, there is more to life than 6th street. instead of going out carousing, wake up early and write a novel set in Stockholm, right here."" this was the coffee around Thanksgiving!

But I don't really know what kind of activity it's suited for. On the one hand, it's way too austere for hanging out with friends. But the chairs are really uncomfortable, work space is limited, and there aren't many outlets, so it's not ideal for reading/studying, either.  So: stop in for great coffee to go, but I wouldn't plan on staying for too long. ", neutral 
Seventh Flag Coffee Co ," 10/7/2015 1 check-in On my infinite journey of finding my favorite coffee shop in Austin I stumbled across Seventh Flag Coffee via yelp (obviously).  My first impression was that the place felt a little incomplete.  I did however appreciate the outdoor benches.  We ordered our usual (vanilla lattes) which are $5 each.  We promptly received our very small cups and went on our way.  The coffee was just mediocre to me.  It was a bit milky and I had a hard time tasting the espresso.  Also, I was not impressed by the baby sized cups for $5. ", neutral 
Seventh Flag Coffee Co ," 8/7/2014 1 check-in Listed in Life is like a cup of coffee Seventh Flag Coffee Co is situated in a converted house on South First. It is conveniently a hop skip and a jump across the street from food trailers to include Torchy's Tacos. They have a welcoming outdoor area with huge shade trees. Outside you will find games and several picnic tables. There are a few parking spots in the back of the cafe otherwise you will need to seek out street parking.  The inside is open with communal seating and simple decor. Seventh Flag Coffee Co supports local by serving Cuvee coffee and Thunderbird Energetica bars. I stopped in on a Saturday afternoon and was greeted with smiling baristas. I ordered a Cuvee Black and Blue which was perfect on a warm summer day. I enjoyed my cold brew outside which is perfect for people watching.  This would be a nice spot to work remotely, read a book or people watch on the weekend. Cuvee Black & Blue ", pos 
Seventh Flag Coffee Co ," 2/1/2016 I visited on a Sunday Afternoon. The café is in nice location in South 1st Street, and even though of you don't get parking in the designated parking spot you can do a street parking. I ordered an Espresso, and worked for 2 hours. I am a wheelchair user and the café is completely wheelchair accessible. The staffs are courteous and helpful. I like the environments. ", pos

Seventh Flag Coffee Co ," 10/22/2015 I'm visiting here in Austin for the Formula One Grand Prix and had a day to kill before the race festivities began. Being a self-admitted ""coffee nerd"" and lover of third-wave coffee culture I decided to take a tour of multiple local cafes. Seventh Flag was the second spot I visited, and I absolutely loved it.  The atmosphere was aesthetically inspiring; sleek and modern with an underlying sense of coziness as it is a repurposed home. Great seating arrangements with tables for socializing, and plenty of spots for artistic wanderers such as myself to sit and write. The noise level was somewhat high, however it was not anything beyond what one would expect at a coffee shop. I simply put in my IEM's and was pleasantly at home in the atmosphere.  More importantly the espresso the barista pulled for me was delicious. Slightly less bright then the flavor profile I strive for at home, but the combination of tobacco like flavor and butteriness paired really well with the chocolate they offer at the counter.  I absolutely loved this place, and it's an early front runner for the top spot of my visit. I'd definitely recommend checking it out ", pos

Seventh Flag Coffee Co ," 5/14/2016 I love their house made chai. As a traveler to India, I'm a bit picky about where I buy chai a second time (first time, I'll get it anywhere because you never know who might surprise ya). Seventh Flag chai is the right about of spicy and toasty. My pup and I love walking over, settling in at a picnic table and spending the afternoon working (me on lesson planning and her on chewing bones). As a bonus, sometimes there's a pop up farmstand so you can not only get some good coffee, but also fresh veg! ", pos

They only offer whole or almond milk (no decaf, no half and half, no 1%, no 2%). Friendly, diligent staff that take their craft seriously. Highly recommend the avocado toast! I'd like to frequent this place however the 12oz latte for $4.50 and avocado toast for $7 - too pricey for what you get to become a regular.

Seventh Flag Coffee Co , 3/11/2016 Coffee was great. I do not want to give 5 stars because the pastries are highly priced. If you want non dairy milk they only have 1 option: almond milk.

Seventh Flag Coffee Co ," 8/19/2015 Finally South First has a great coffee shop!  Apologies to the other coffee places along South First -- they're fine, but not on the same level as Seventh Flag, which is on par with the best of the new breed of coffee shops opening across Austin.    I appreciate their commitment to finding the best beans and honing the preparation. It's one of the two places in Austin where I've *never* had a bad cappuccino. The only knock is their baked goods are not my daughter's favorite, so it's sometimes hard to rally her to walk over with me.  Some of the other reviews out there mention unfriendly service, which is something I've never experienced there. ", pos 
Seventh Flag Coffee Co ," 6/15/2016 I love the atmosphere of this place, and the guy who took my order was so friendly!

I'll definitely be back to work out of here too. , pos 
Seventh Flag Coffee Co ," 10/8/2015 This place is great every time I go. With an espresso order you get both a shot glass of Topo Chico and a shot glass of their own coffee infused tea. Nice touch! They also pour a top notch cappuccino. They have great rotating roasters, including Huckleberry (a personal fave) and Stumptown.  The thing for me that sets good coffee shops apart are the quality of baristas. Here, they truly know what they're doing. The dude with longer brown hair and glasses is an espresso master. Props to you man.  The interior is wonderfully modern and chic. Funny enough, I had designed my own condo in a very similar manner, and then a few months later Seventh Flag opened. Feels like home!

Seventh Flag Coffee Co ," 2/23/2015 Very funky, personable coffee place (old house, ample parking, super high-end coffee presentation) that is great for meetings or pretending you're writing your novel while actually playing solitaire or stalking old flames on Facebook. Unlike some indy coffee places, Seventh Flag is clean. That is good. I sense the dudes behind the counter (is the term ""barista"" trademarked by Starbucks? I don't want to get in trouble here...) know and care more about coffee than I ever will, so that's good. I know a little bit about how a plane works, but it's always good when the pilot is a few steps ahead of me... So, bottom line, good coffee, nice atmosphere, clean place, knowledgeable, friendly staff. Ample parking. Worth the trip. ", pos

Seventh Flag Coffee Co ," 1/5/2015 2 check-ins This space is beautiful, and such a quiet, pretty house in the south first neighborhood. There is great natural lighting and tacodeli, and the small parking lot in back plus curb parking is somehow always more than enough at times I've visited.  The furniture setup is interesting: I do think it looks great and it's definitely very spacious, but one large table is pretty much communal seating and outside of that, there's only a few tables that could be easily grabbed. Luckily, the seats outside almost double the capacity on nice days. I'm not sure it's cozy enough for reading, but the Cuvee is solid and it's a great place for small meetups or for studying or working. ", pos

Seventh Flag Coffee Co ," 1/14/2015 Rainy, dreary day sometimes calls for hanging out at a cute coffee shop. Stopped by here today, it was already almost 3 so I got a chai and then later a london fog. Both were amazing! I wish I could have tried out the coffee but I would be awake all night. The chai was incredible, tastes like my homemade chai! So impressed it wasn't a boxed chai. The london fog was also delicious..the only other place I've had one (other than Starbucks) was Bouldin creek and their LF is very watered down. They use a regular tea bag here but made sure it was steeped for a long time before adding milk.I loved that they took as much care into making tea based drinks as they would their coffee drinks.  Every detail is important, even the mugs the coffee is served in which has a simple 7 on one side. I appreciate that a place like this exists in my neighborhood. There are already a ton of great places in the area but this combines all of them. For example, Fair bean has the light but I'm not a huge fan of the coffee anymore. Once Over has great coffee, but the room itself is kinda dark and drab.  The tables filled up quickly but by 5 a lot of the crowd had cleared out. I can't wait to drink their cold brew! It looked like a guinness coming out of the keg haha. they don't have much in terms of snacks but Regal ravioli is next door and I adore them! ", pos

We stopped here because we wanted some solid coffee to go with our gourdough donuts across the street.  We got the French press and the regular coffee.

Seventh Flag Coffee Co ," 7/6/2015 1 check-in There are tons of signs outside that read, ""NOW OPEN,"" and so I was a little confused when I was told that they just celebrated their one-year anniversary. But what the hay.  Thoughts: --The coffee shop is austere, and modern, and clean. --The coffee selection is great. --The staff is not just friendly, but seem outrageously happy to be there. --There is a huge outdoor seating section, great for dogs. --Yes, the chairs are made of wood and, like any other modern furniture these days, are simply not comfortable. --There are about 5 parking spaces, but that's true of any place on South First. --The hours seem a little weird to me. Why do they close at 7:00 pm? --Misc thought: there could be more food options. There's a food park across the street if you're willing to risk your life playing chicken to get there. --The prices seem a little higher than some other comparable places but nothing that would require redirection. --The baristas (baristos?) compete in latte art competitions around town, so might be worth checking out one of those. --Good temperature, and good music to boot.

Seventh Flag Coffee Co ," 11/16/2014 I really like this coffee shop. Decent lot parking and plenty of street parking, which is always great on S. 1st.  Interior decor is beautiful and simple. Most chairs don't have backs, so it's not a place I would spend a lot of time in, but great to drink a cup of coffee and skeedaddle. Also, would be good to grab a cup of coffee to pair with a Gourdough's donut across the street.  Baristas are super friendly. They usually have a decent selection of baked goods. Espresso is good, but I was disappointed in their chai. It was very watery and not so flavorful. Guess it's a sign I should stick to the coffee... ", pos

Seventh Flag Coffee Co ," 10/25/2014 1 check-in Decided to check out seventh flag for a late afternoon pick-me-up. One of the things I loved: parking. There isn't tons of lit parking but a couple of spots were open when I got three. There is also quite a bit of close street parking.  The interior is clean and contemporary, lots of light colors and a large open area. There is a bit of seating inside, mainly at bar height communal tables. There Is also quite a bit of seating outside.  I got an Americano. My usual. And it was incredibly inexpensive, which was nice. After the drink was made, it was incredibly too hot to drink. I typically like my drinks less hot than most, but I felt like this was way too hot. But, of course, it cooled down. After it cooled down it was pretty good, it would be nice to go back there and work on stuff (it was sort of loud in there, but with headphones it would be wonderful) ", pos 
Seventh Flag Coffee Co ," 6/10/2015 I don't drink coffee or many hot beverages so this review is really based on the fact that they carry Tacodeli tacos and Tacodeli isn't anywhere near my house or work.

In any case, super excited they have my favorite taco, sadly others also like it too and it sometimes sells out! ", pos

The inside has a sophisticated yet simple and clean feel and layout, with simple decorations (including a framed needle-point), a fireplace, and a nice wooden floor.

And with parking too.  There's a small porch outside in the front with a couple of tables and chairs to work from. The inside isn't huge like Dominican Joe or Monkey Nest but they've done a great job placing the seating so that there's many options and it feels spacious.  Coffee is good, wifi is good.

Seventh Flag Coffee Co ," 1/13/2016 Three stars because the coffee is always good. In a pinch, this is a safe bet. Coffee has good flavor, good foam.  Everyone there is always very friendly.  Stars off because: Expensive. Five dollars for a 12 oz mocha, 4.5 dollars for a latte of the same size. For some reason, drinks only come in 12 ounces. Usually means if I get an iced Americano in the Texas heat I'm guaranteed a luke warm beverage within five minutes (stingy on the ice, because hey, there's no room for coffee in the teeny tiny cup). Last, between the concrete floors, uncomfortable seats, stark white walls (and one accent wall of wood paneling), it's strangely reminiscent of hanging out in a freeway rest stop. ", neutral 
Seventh Flag Coffee Co ," 8/28/2015 1 check-in Stopped in for a quick fix, ordered a double iced americano (my usual) and was happy to see that their prices were in line with what I am used to. This place is super cute inside and out, with lots of seating and even a bocce game outside! My americano came out a light brown color, worrying. It also tasted very weak. Maybe I should have gone with the triple? Regardless I was a little underwhelmed with the strength of the coffee itself. It was fine, but I honestly expect better from an independent coffee shop and hope they up their game in the future! ", neutral 
Seventh Flag Coffee Co ," 2/7/2015 This coffee shop is beyond legit. I came here to study with my friend and she brought her pooch, so we sat outside on their pebble-floor patio in the sunshine. The wireless connection is automatic- simply power on and click the 7th Flag logo and gain access. None of those, ""What's your WiFi password?"" questions or authentication process. Inside, friendly baristas will serve your order, and you will notice the absence of a caffeinated beverage menu. It's very chic if you think about it, everyone knows all the coffee variations and ends up ordering their own version anyway. ""One small double soy latte for here, please,"" I asked, and the silkly, smooth latte was my reward. The foam was also perfection. Hats off to 7th Flag! ", pos

Seventh Flag Coffee Co ," 7/15/2014 Great location and love the fact that there's a parking lot.  Although this is nice coffee shop with a great location and parking lot in back, I don't think it's the right fit for me for a few reasons.  #1: I'm not a coffee drinker, so I always order a juice, kombucha, lemonade, etc., but 7th flag doesn't have any of these options.  #2: The interior design has a Bo Concept - modern & contemporary look. While it looks super sleek...there are no backs on the chairs. Perhaps this was by design to keeping people from overstaying their welcome... (: Either way - looks sleek but lacks in comfort.  Pro - there is a sweet patio and porch with seating.  If you are looking for coffee, aren't looking to stay too long and have a really strong back, this is the place for you. (: ", neutral

The atmosphere is a great place for a date as it has a very cozy and intimate vibe. They also gave a good amount of marshmallows for the two of us. The smores were good- however, nothing too special, just the average roast it yourself by the fire with chocolate and graham crackers. Because it was generic, the price could be a bit lower for this treat on the menu (we paid $7- the price of many entrees around Austin). I assume you are paying for the experience. My cravings were, on the other hand, satisfied.  This place is great to visit occasionally- especially late at night because they offer lots of alcoholic drinks, coffee, and snacks.

Halcyon ," 11/6/2016 Out for my own personal coffee tour of downtown ATX (recently moved to the neighborhood) and up next was Halcyon.  Stopped in about 1000am on Saturday.  Short line but plenty of tables available.  Two people working the counter so patiently waited my turn.  Female behind the counter was pretty surly.  She was taking orders, serving at the counter, so chalk it up to maybe just a busy morning.  When it was my turn no eye contact just a ""what do you want to order"".  Okay.. there for the coffee not to make a new friend.  Ordered a coconut milk latte, paid, tipped, and walked over to wait.    The latte was perfection and the guy making it smiled and told me to enjoy.  Went outside and sat at the railing to drink my coffee and enjoy the city morning noise  Lots of people watching.  Didn't order food but they had the typical ATX breakfast menu.  Have to say the coffee warrants another trip back to give it another shot and also keep the review from being a 2 star.  With all the choices for coffee in the area, good coffee is helped by friendly service.  Just a tip. ", neutral

Pleased to report that my love of this place was not tainted by the rose colored glasses of my former relationship.  Yes, seating here is going to suck. It's hit or miss when you come in. But on nights where you need to stay up late cranking in work and in order to not fall asleep doing so---you need commotion, possibly a loud band and a decent hustle and bustle around you----Halcyon is the right place. I love that you can roast marshmallows here. I love during the right season there's like 10 different spiked hot chocolates to choose from, and I love that you have your choice of coffee or spirits.  Love this place. The employees are awesome, the bathrooms are clean, and just remember....be aggressive when you see a seat free up! ", pos

I was a bit confused that despite being ""eat in"" my cappuccino was made as to-go. But it was alright. The french toast isn't your traditional french toast, it's actually pretty dense...more like a bread pudding construction.

This is a great place to come during your morning work routine, or for a date, or for a reunion with an old friend! Yay!  Why didn't I give it five stars!? They were filming a movie! And, no, it wasn't cool. It was bothersome and it seemed to make the service... Less attentive. I know this may seem like a grumpy review, like, darn you kids and your fancy Polaroid cameras!!! But it really was annoying. The cashier wasn't the most polite guy. I didn't know you were supposed to order up front first (you order up front first!). And he kinda treated me like I was an idiot. It was not welcoming... It was more like, ""oh you DON'T come here all the time?! Well allow me to make you feel like a lesser person."" Yuck.

And if you don't want coffee you can have adult beverages, (there's a nice long bar), buy cigarettes ( I don't smoke but they have a huge wall of packs) buy cigars, (they have a humidor room!!!)and even delicious desserts. Like the smores- which is a must, they give you a little gas flame thing and you can melt your own marshmallows.

It was world music night and about 10 different people came to jam out on an array of different instruments, playing music from India, the Middle East, Spain, etc. Everyone together. They were great and people in the audience started dancing. Totally unexpected and totally an element of why Austin is so amazing to create spaces for this to happen and in such unexpected places.  Had a great time. Nice folks at the bar. ", pos 
Halcyon ," 6/9/2016 This spot is literally perfection - smack dab in otherwise dirty downtown. A modern interior with tons of intimate couch seating, or traditional bar type seating if you prefer. This place is the perfect pitstop. We arrived here on Friday night and ordered drinks and 'smores. I love the coffee meets dessert meets drinks aspect here, it's refreshing compared to the rest of the dirty 6.  The only thing that's a bit gross is the fact that their restaurant is open to the public and we saw the most random people walk in and use their bathroom which kinda marred the vibe a bit.  Otherwise, I love everything about this place - I'm sure it makes for the perfect daytime brunch and coffee spot as well! A must-visit if you're in Austin! ", pos 
Halcyon ," 9/10/2015 1 check-in Vibe is chill. Bartender is cool but for the price of the drinks I expected more with a lot better flavor and more diverse choices.  Bee's Knees wasn't on the menu but was made for me anyway. Okay. Bartender added quite a bit of gin which of course is pretty dry so even the honey couldn't sweeten it up by much.  Lemon Rhubarb was basically just sparkling lemon with a touch of alcohol. Where was my rhubarb? They looked oh, so very pretty but looks were kind of deceiving.  Thin mint is good but the person I was with that indulged in it said it sickened them after just a few slurps.  Hot chocolate was pretty bitter and really just could have used more sugar. It's hot chocolate, my friends. I'm trying to indulge, not be healthy!  Pretty cool that they have a cigarette bar inside to make purchases from and I love the idea of a coffee shop, food, and a bar combined but I'll stick with just getting the food and non alcoholic beverages (skipping the hot chocolate) next time I'm in here. Hot chocolate - not the best I've had but not horrible. Thin Mint. Chocolate rim with a mint alcoholic milkshake. Good but way too sweet after the first few drinks. Bee's Knees- off the menu; honey, lemon, gin. See all photos from Hannah H. for Halcyon ", neutral 
Halcyon ," 3/9/2016 1 check-in What a cute place!  I heard so many good things about their s'mores, and I was in such a s'mores kick so I had to try it out.  I can't say it worked perfectly, and made my marshmallows nice and crisp and gooey on the inside, but It tasted fine!    Their coffee is also very delicious.  I love Austin coffee anyways.  Their beans are so aromatically wonderful.  Great place to go to with a group, or even alone! ", pos

Halcyon ," 3/28/2016 1 check-in A friend recommended that I try Halcyon while I was in Austin and I'm so glad I did! My barista was actually from the same town I am, which was absolutely insane to me because it's over 500 miles away! This coffee shop is in a great location and not too far from anything! I ordered an iced latte and my husband got a chocolate frappe and both were excellent! Halcyon has a full bar, so you can add a shot to any drink you purchase. The ambience is awesome, and there is a ton of comfy seating. Their art is mostly from local artists and right now they have huge glitter paintings of celebrities and I almost emptied out my savings account for one of them, but you can't exactly fit a 40x50 canvas in a carry-on bag.

Halcyon ," 2/2/2016 Listed in Austin Coffeshop Bucket List This is my go to when I am late night raving on 4th.  It can be a bit packed, the baristas a bit pretentious, and the wait time a bit too long...but you are in downtown ATX, kiddo and you gotta learn that this is the norm somewhere so it might as well be where they have ""DIY s'mores"" and killer Thai Iced Tea (w/a shot of espresso, it is DIVINE!) and is one of the better ""after all the bars close"" people watching perches! ", pos 
Halcyon ," 2/2/2016 1 check-in A date night place if I've ever seen one before. It had a distinct hipster-y vibe and it's probably a place you'd expect to see in Austin. The guy we were getting advice from at Berry Austin suggested that we come here for ""the best hot chocolate and s'mores in town"". Since we were pretty much done with alcohol at this point, we stopped in for a bit.  It's pretty cute and I think the s'mores are a unique and excellent idea. Basically they bring a lighter, light it for you, and you roast your s'mores over a little fire. Yum! I haven't had s'mores in a long time. There's only enough for about two of them a piece, so make sure you savor every bite!  I ordered the peanut butter hot chocolate. I thought it was okay, but the peanut butter was being overruled by the chocolate and the hot temperature from the drink. Note to self: peanut butter in a hot drink doesn't seem to mix very well with its contents. I tried scooping the peanut butter out with my straw and almost gagged on the remnants of the peanut butter. Bleghh.  Well, that minor detail aside, I would recommend taking your bae here and showing her how manly you are by not starting your marshmellow on fire. ", pos 
Halcyon , 9/18/2016 1 check-in Very nice a clean setup. Food was very good for a light breakfast. The French toast was just as good as mother made. Great morning breakfast in Texas. , pos 
Halcyon ," 1/22/2016 Halcyon is a really nice place if you're looking for an edgier place to chill with some friends on a late night for coffee or dessert.  It's most known for the smore's - they give you a small fire, graham crackers, chocolate, and marshmallows to roast yourself right there in the cafe. I'm not a huge fan of smore's, and it is a  bit pricey here, but I do like the environment here, and the fact that it's open quite late.  The chocolate cake is really decadent, so if that's what you like, I recommend trying it! I haven't had much of their other food, but they offer a lot of snacks. Unfortunately, they don't serve food after around 11 PM, I believe.  For people just visiting Austin, I think there are better places to get dessert, coffee, and alcohol, so Halcyon isn't one of my favorite places to go. But if you're already downtown, or live in Austin, definitely check it out. ", pos

What really makes Halcyon great though is their wonderful staff. Just a great bunch of people that are super friendly and make everyone feel welcome. Caffeine junkies should ask for the Quad Latte. Also, the breakfast tacos are fantastic. Excellent place to day drink as well for those so inclined.  Great place for tourists to get their bearings on a visit since you're in the warehouse district and close to Congress and Sixth. My personal favorite of the many downtown coffee shops. ", pos

Halcyon ," 11/5/2015 3 check-ins The Good: This place is pretty consistent in everything it offers. Good coffee, vibe, people, service, etc. It's not you're usual coffee shop. On any given night you can find live music, smoke hookah or roast some marshmallows and make s'mores.  The Bad: as in most dt locations if you're looking for a work-place or a stop-and-go coffee this is not a easy place to stop at, unless you live downtown. Parking around this area is not easy, but not impossible. ", pos 
Halcyon ," 11/3/2015 I've only been to Halcyon a few times in the company of friends who knew some of the bartenders/baristas. Based on those experiences, service and the price of our cocktails was quite reasonable. Absurdly reasonable.  Nepotism aside, I really enjoy the environment at Halcyon and the enormous selection of drinks they offer. It's hard to beat sitting outside on a pleasant fall day and people watching. I've never gotten the S'Mores before, but it definitely looks like quite a fun thing to do and would be perfect for a date. ", pos

Although the espresso martini was tempting me.  The soy latte was very nice. My husband had the pour over coffee which was very good!  For lunch, I had the walnut apple salad. It was the perfect size and very nice. My husband had the Elvis - a PBJ with bacon, banana and honey. They classify this as a ""snack"", but it certainly can be had for lunch. He would have licked his plate if I allowed him.  Halcyon is a cool place with a cool vibe - quintessential ""Austin"". I need to come back and try one of these espresso drinks. A soy vanilla latte The apple walnut salad - very yummy! See all photos from Suann G. for Halcyon ", pos

They bring you the s'mores kit which is the marshmallows, hershey bars, and graham crackers and a mini fire stove so you can roast your own marshmallows! The atmosphere is super chill. I've been when they've had a live musician. It isn't too loud which is good because you can actually talk to who you're with. They have couches and tables and tallboys. It's across from all the gay bars and next door to Cedar Street Courtyard which are both fun spots to check out after you enjoy your s'mores. ", pos 
Halcyon , 8/24/2015 Not sure why I made such a big mistake by not ordering the s'mores but I think I need to come back and try it.  Came here to meet up with a friend on a Saturday afternoon and it was decently packed but nothing to crazy.  I ordered the Iced Latte and sat down for a couple hours to do some work.  The wifi was nothing to crazy but it did the job.  The overall environment in Halcyon was really nice.  Not too loud but not library silent.

Whether it's during the day or at night post-club/post-bar, this place never disappoints.  The s'mores and drinks are amazing here. I highly recommend you try the espresso martini - one of my favorite alcoholic drinks in Austin! I've also had the Nutella crepe, which was absolutely delectable. I honestly don't think you could go wrong with many of the items on the menu here.  It may seem a little small here, but there's actually a plethora of seating options available. Of course if you come at night, especially during the weekend, it may be a tad difficult to find seating. Fortunately, there's also seating outdoors. S'mores and espresso martinis. ", pos 
Halcyon ," 10/2/2015 The wife and I stopped in late night after dinner. I needed a little caffeine before the drive back to our hotel. We stumbled upon Halcyon and it had a great vibe going on. We lucked out and got a little corner area to sit and take in all the action as we had a view of the whole place. Now this review is mainly for the cold brew coffee and the coconut tea that the wife got, as well as the service provided. All was excellent and we really enjoyed the relaxed atmosphere.  It seems like they have some type of s'mores dessert that was clearly popular as we saw it on more than a few tables. I'm sure that they have some other food options, but we really didn't take a look at the menu other than for coffees and teas. We would definitely return and hang out at Halcyon whenever we find ourselves in downtown Austin. ", pos

Iced coffee was a good - not too bitter, just the way I like it. We also got the Migas breakfast tacos with avocado cream. They were really good, but beware the red salsa - it is extremely spicy. Also enjoyed the overnight French toast. Service was friendly and the place was very quiet and peaceful on a Sunday morning. ", pos 
Halcyon ," 3/3/2015 1 check-in Listed in Pretending to Hook 'Em The way I would describe this place is a Michael Buble song laced with a couple shots of whiskey. All in all, I had a hard time deciding between 4 and 5 stars. Let's be conservative and stick with 4 for now.  AMBIENCE Ohmygosh so romantic!! Red-orange lighting, live music (modified string ensemble with drum and guitar), colorful bejeweled portraits of famous people on the walls (Audrey Hepburn, Lady Day, Snoop Dogg just to name a few), varied seating in and outdoors, stools and couches, and a bar! Very cozy and intimate.  FOOD & DRANK Did I say intimate? How about s'mores for 2? At your table? Honestly this is probably just a thing for first-timers to order but it is still a really adorable and creative concept. My cappuccino came in a giant cozy mug. My friend's latte came in a yellow one! The color was adorable! Milk foam on mine could have been stiffer but the overall taste of the drink was strong and smooth.  SERVICE The baristas were wonderful, fabulous, friendly, and so easy to talk to I honestly didn't know how to go about interacting with them LOL. They addressed me by name and all that jazz.  Overall, I highly recommend this place for even though it is busy, it still creates an intimate atmosphere for whoever you choose to come with. Open late into the night, conducive to deep talks and cute dates. A cafe, with a bit of spice from the bar. S'mores for three! With an americano and peppermint latte in the background ", pos 
Halcyon , 8/21/2015 I had the cosmonaut and it was pretty darn good! The vibe is chill and their music playlist was bomb(in a good way).

Halcyon ," 9/11/2015 OVERALL: great place for a quick bite for dessert on a date!  AMBIENCE: perfect little place to go for a date with mild lighting and couches for you to sit. These couches have very comfortable pillows to make you feel like you're in your own home. There are some corners with couches that give you a lot of privacy also. Sometimes have live music playing which is quaint but not overpowering of the night to where it's all you can hear.  TASTE: we had the smores for 2 people which was about $7. It was your basic Hershey's bar, marshmallows and graham crackers that you could put together from any supermarket but it comes with a small flame to make everything yourself which is cute to share :)  SERVICE: No really waitress, but pay at the counter and they bring it to you. They don't really check up on you until you are on your way out. Staff is nice though! Basic smores for 2 with moist towelettes for the mess! Date night with the private corner of pillows!

Halcyon ," 7/24/2015 Really needed some coffee around midnight since we flew in on a Friday and were tired from the traveling.  We were really surprised how there was a cafe right in the middle of downtown where the party was happening!  Got an iced latte and it was good.  Very nice espresso with whole milk.  Tried a bit of the soy chai latte and typically I'm not a huge chai fan, but it was some tasty brew!  Didn't try the food, but plenty of people had drinks from the bar also on a Friday night.  The atmosphere is definitely on the cool side.  Outdoor area is great for people watching. ", pos

They have eight different kinds of hot Toddy's!  Eight!  The Buttery Rum is absolutely delicious.  A friend ordered coffee with Bailey's and was happy as a clam.

Halcyon ," 1/7/2015 1 check-in The two things I ordered at Halcyon both involved chocolate.  1) S'mores This is an ingenious idea that I wish more coffee shops did. It was freezing (for Austin) standards and I had a lot of fun torching marshmallows (and watching my girlfriend light a few on fire) before squashing them in between some Graham crackers and chocolate. Love it.  2) Some sort of chocolate martini thing. I don't really know what it was because I was drunk, but it sure was yummy when I had it! You should be able to figure it out when you get there.  Really cool building interior, but definitely not enough seats for its location downtown. You seat yourself, and I think most people have enough sense to leave after they're done with their coffee or whatever they're having. There aren't many electrical outlets handy, so that certainly helps keep the stereotypical buy-one-coffee-and-stay-all-day-on-your-laptop customers away.

Halcyon ," 8/6/2015 This is a great breakfast place! I got a Lox bagel and a Thai iced coffee, and they were both delicious. The bagel came out unassembled, and I am always a little confused when a breakfast sandwich comes out like this. I really liked this one though. The presentation with the lox was really pretty, and it made it seem like I was having a really fancy breakfast at this low key joint. The sandwich itself tasted really fresh even for this New England girl. The coffee packed just the right punch of caffeine, coffee flavor, and sweetness. I had initially asked for a French Press (apparently I only like country based coffee beverages), and they don't actually offer that anymore. Since I ordered that and couldn't get it, the barista actually took $4 off of my bill. So my coffee was almost free! I didn't expect it, and it definitely got my morning off to a good start.  The actual place has a cool vibe with exposed beams and brick walls, local artists work for sale on the walls, brightly colored accents everywhere, and classic bluesy tunes playing in the background. They have great places for working, but they also have cozy places to curl up with a book or even hang with friends. They also have a full bar for the evenings, and I can only imagine this place heats up at night. The baristas are super friendly and helpful (see above), and the wifi is free!

The cappuccino was excellent and went perfectly with our s'more feast and my friend's mudslide was tasty but after one sip I was ready to take on 6th street! The s'mores were a blast, we had fun shaking off the flames from the mallows and acting normal when they went flying onto nearby hipster messenger bags/or backs(tee hee). Use caution with those flames!

Visited a few times so far, first time had lunch, other times had drinks, coffee, and s'mores on the last date. Only comes with one or two servings so would have been down for a double order. Because of the night time buzz people seem very social even in the day time for a cafe when you want to just be working with wifi. Not the silent-whisper to your friend kind of cafe. Good times. ", pos 
Halcyon ," 7/2/2016 1 check-in Good place for coffee. Espresso was a bit watered down, though their La Marzocco machine is nice and I suspect it was just a poorly dialed in shot (but they obliged to give me a pull of a single origin). Iced toddy brew and cappuccino were solid. Good seating inside and out. ", pos 
Halcyon ," 4/16/2015 Updated review 2 check-ins Went here one night with my little sis to catch up since I moved to Houston, and what a great place to do so! We had both ordered an alcoholic drink that was somehow mixed with coffee (Irish coffee?) feeling a little adventurous and the cool and totally hipster s'mores snack/meal/thing. The s'mores came with I believe about four items of each of the essential components for s'mores, but at one point of the night, we underestimated how much cracker to use and had to ask for extra crackers. The cashier up front simply smiled and gave us a couple more with no charge, which was pretty nice of him since a line had begun to form outside of the building. The atmosphere is really chill. A nice cafe to go to when you don't wanna be dealing with 6th street drunkards. I do gotta say though claim your seats swiftly and quickly! Dem seats are in demand. ", pos 
Halcyon , 5/25/2015 Not as good as I remembered. We ordered Carmel hot cocoa and a peanut butter hot chocolate. Added baileys to each but just wasn't like I remembered the last time I was here.  I do recommend the smores. They are fun on a late night and so yummy!  The place is always packed even late with a very fun and eclectic crowd. We made a special stop since its one of my Austin favorites. It just didn't meet my expectations this time. , neutral 
Halcyon ," 9/23/2015 1 check-in A very relaxing cool atmosphere. My bestfriend who visits Austin often comes here during the day to get coffee and do her art. She loves this place and told us to come by!  I ordered what my friend usually gets which is a hazelnut frappaccino. It was so delicious not too sweet and had so much flavor! It is a bit on the really creamy side especially when you're down to the bottom of the frap it gets really foamy but eh, I don't mind that!  I love the atmosphere of this place, everyone seems to be to themselves but very friendly. A great place to study not too loud and pretty relaxing music. It's way better than Starbucks and if you're visiting in town like me I would definitely suggest this coffee place as a must stop by! ", pos 
Halcyon , 7/12/2016 If you only have time for one bar or coffee shop in Austin.... Go here. Best mojito I've had in Austin. Also the amazing coffee goes great with the smores! , pos 
Halcyon ," 5/20/2015 I love chocolate. I also love ice cream. And tea. And hot chocolate. Obviously, I love s'mores.    I am not a huge fan of alcohol. So a place that can combine the two successfully is so appealing to me. Either way, Halcyon is a FANTASTIC place to go to for just regular hot chocolate. Seriously, they have 4 different types of hot chocolate. Heavily on the chocolate (French Hot Chocolate), so delicious.. The other hot chocolate type that I tried is the Bittersweet caramel. I really love caramel, and it's this is a little salty and just fantastic.  Of course I'm going to talk about the s'mores. The s'mores are great -- they give you a little fire and you can melt the marshmellows and it's like you're at camp again! Except you're inside, there's no mosquitos and you're surrounded by comfy pillows.  If you are looking for a sweet intimate date -- Halcyon is the best place I can think about. The seating is sectioned off, there's pillows everywhere... ", pos 
Halcyon ," 9/14/2014 1 check-in I've been here multiple times, and I normally would give it five stars, except that parking is always insane, because this is on the corner of such a busy area!  Their food is great, and the drinks to me are just okay. What makes this place so cool is the atmosphere and the type of people that frequent here. You get a mix of your normal coffee drinkers with those that like to drink and have a good time, and you get a great mix of people all at once.    The service is always very attentive to your needs. Yesterday, I ordered a Thai tea, and I saw one, and thought it was mine so I took it.  The kind bartender told me that it was actually someone's previous drink that they forgot to pick up, but he gave me the option of getting a new one. And when they ran out of the Thai tea, he offered me a special drink which happened to be a very tasteful iced chai tea latte.  So, I always give special props and good reviews to those that have great service! The menu ", pos 
Halcyon ," 5/28/2015 If you have time to spare, Halcyon is a great spot to start off or finish your night downtown. Love the location and the fact that it's clearly marked and visible. The iced latte I had was fine, but nothing special. However, the green tea frappe was spectacular! Chocolate peanut butter frappe was nice without feeling too heavy.The hibiscus tea is good too, if you don't mind paying almost $3 for iced tea.  I agree that the s'mores are probably a first-timer gimmick, but they're so fun. And so cute. And such a perfect date idea. Service can be pretty-to-really slow, so go if you have time to spare and hang around. Note that the designated coffee pick up area is not clearly marked and is practically at the bar, which is confusing.  The pomegranate margarita was fine - strong enough, but nothing I'd come back for. Mainly, I bought it to try out the bar/coffeeshop environment.  Atmosphere is cool - almost too cool. The couches add a cozy feel and I like when there's a good amount of people in there. Overall a fun spot to stop if you're downtown! ", neutral 
Halcyon , 1/11/2016 Atmosphere is the best feature of this coffeeshop/bar.  I really like their latté and coffee in general , pos 
Halcyon ," 11/15/2015 1 check-in We ordered the Nutella crepes, which was okay; it tasted more like eating plain nutella than anything. The place has a good vibe, and it would be a place I would go to if it wasn't crowded (seating is hard to find). I wished I could have tried a cocktail! ", neutral 
Halcyon ," 1/7/2016 6 check-ins Used to come here frequently in the summer to read and hang out while waiting for my bf to get off of work downtown. Definitely a cool place to chill if you can find the space. Seating is pretty limited and the place is normally filled with other people working. (which is probably a good sign otherwise) Always a lot of cool art on the walls. I normally would order the hazelnut frappe but have tried the different iced teas, thai iced tea and have gotten a salmon salad that was one of their specials and have tried other things off their menu. Food is always pretty good and the prices are reasonable. I have yet to try drinks from the bar but in terms of my other drinks I've had slightly sloppy drinks made here and really really good ones depending on the barista. Tipping definitely will go a long way here.. ", pos 
Halcyon ," 6/23/2016 Halcyon is the perfect spot for so many things: Great coffee, great food, great live music and GREAT breakfast tacos!!  Every Friday I pick up breakfast tacos for my office as an end-of-week treat and when I found out Halcyon was starting to serve breakfast tacos, I had to try them for myself. DELICIOUS! My office had a taste test with various vendors in downtown and Halcyon won, hands down.  As an added bonus, everyone at Halcyon is friendly and goes out of their way to make sure I'm happy. Mari and Jules are especially great and always greet me with a smile, making me feel like I'm entering into a friend's kitchen.  If I could give more than five stars, I would! ", pos 
Halcyon ," 2/9/2015 Guys, I'm not gonna lie, I've hated on Halcyon for a while. It was kinda that place  where you'd go freshman and sophomore year of college when you wanted to go downtown, but couldn't actually go downtown (pre-21 lyfe). The first time I ever went, we celebrated a friend's birthday with the s'mores everyone is obsessed with. But you know, after doing s'mores the real way and having a real campfire, or even a gas stove for that matter, a small lantern ain't that impressive. Sorry, Halcyon.  Then, when a friend visited me junior year, we went to Halcyon, because even though I wasn't a fan of the s'mores, I do like me some coffee. Sadly, the coffee drinks were pretty sub-par and when Patika is a couple of blocks away, I'd rather opt for the real stuff. I remember we both got cafe au lait's and they were pretty meh - more milk than coffee and not even good coffee. I was really trying, Halcyon. At least you're still cute.  But apparently, it took me moving half way across the country for me to find Halcyon's sweet spot: cocktails. A friend I was visiting in Austin is obsessed with Halcyon. Seriously, OBSESSED. Thankfully, she admitted that the s'mores are unimpressive and the coffee isn't great, so I had renewed faith when she told me that the cocktails/beer/wine are pretty stellar. And she was damn right. Two cocktails almost took me to outer space (shout out to Dwight, the awesome bartender, and his awesome NASA cap). We had 4 cocktails in total, and naturally, I can only remember the name of one (Pine & Pear) - but ALL of them were amazing! You've redeemed yourself, Halcyon. ", pos 
Halcyon ," 9/13/2015 Listed in Austin We came for smores only. I love the concept of this, coffee, beer, and smores!  The lines are crazy long and the seating indoors is tight. There is seating outside as well.  It is warm in there so the chocolate bar was already melting!! It was a fun late night activity. ", neutral 
Halcyon ," 6/7/2016 1 check-in Coffee, tea, spirits, live music, art, people watching, and s'mores?! Cool place. Lots of seating. Open late. :) ", pos 
Halcyon ," 7/14/2014 1 check-in This shop is definitely not as good as the one in San Antonio but it'll do the trick.  Located downtown, this Halcyon is a lot smaller than the one in Southtown (SAT) but it does have more eclectic seating. The crowd looks quite the same; mostly early 20-something, more than likely college students.  The drinks are about the same although I found their chai to be a bit on the spicy side (not heat spicy just chai spicy). My wife just ordered tea so had they messed that up, well, things would have gotten nasty.  The one downer was the woman taking our order - the one with all the facial accoutrements that would make it impossible to pass through airport security. She was a bit on the sour-disposition side of things to say the least. I mean, when someone thanks you for something, how hard is it to say, ""you're welcome,"" or even just a ""no problem?""  One thing I noticed about this place is that they have make-them-yourself smores. You get a tray with a cast iron hibachi, a stack of graham crackers, 2 bars of Hershey's chocolates, marshmallows, and skewers. Too cool. Now maybe the Halcyon is Southtown has this but I've never seen nor asked. Unfortunately, my wife was not interested in making smores. Bummer!  Two other quick notes to pass along... Yes, they do have outdoor seating and yes, free WiFi. The latter is slower than a Lada heading down M58 in January. ", neutral 
Irie Bean Coffee Bar ," 10/30/2016 Beautiful coffee place with a great patio on the back! Hammocks and a very cool area to hang out while you drink one of their tasty coffees. We even had a pork bun from East Side King which is next to the café and it elevated the experience to another level. Yeah! Coffee and pork bun! Not the best combination when you think about it but totally worth it. Specially when it's happy hour and you have great stuff on the menu. Anyway, going back to the coffee shop, the staff is super nice and the place even nicer. Good prices and lots of options! ", pos 
Irie Bean Coffee Bar ," 8/11/2016 I'm not a huge coffee drinker, but my spouse partakes often, and we enjoy taking 30 minutes every now and again for a breakfast date after dropping our kiddo at school. Irie was a great find in the 04. The staff is friendly. The vanilla lattes are good. The other customers are friendly and the atmosphere is pretty cozy. Plus, they have Alma's breakfast tacos, which I love.  Parking can be an issue on the weekends, but during the weekday around 8:15 am, the neighboring businesses aren't yet open, so there is ample parking. You may run into issues if you need to turn left into commuter traffic to head north, however.  We've tried a lot of locally owned coffee places in the area and this is our favorite in South Austin. ", pos 
Irie Bean Coffee Bar ," 12/5/2016 My review is all about the hammocks in the backyard. I got a delicious soy latte and pretty much swung for an hour straight. Fantastic backyard set up, yummy drinks. I'll be hanging here whenever I get a chance to visit the southside. ", pos 
Irie Bean Coffee Bar ," 10/3/2016 1 check-in The 4 stars is for their hip outside seating area and the welcoming service we had here. The weather was perfect outside and there was plenty of shade. I can't say much about the food or coffee because I didn't try any of it. I really came here to read a book in a chill environment. For the most part it was relaxing to sit in the hammocks and read my book but I could hear some men working and clanking some things around (not so relaxing). But that obviously isn't the stores fault, there are other business very close by. I'll be returning, and trying some of their coffee! ", pos 
Irie Bean Coffee Bar ," 6/17/2016 3 check-ins This place is a great, locally-run establishment. All the workers are very friendly and it has that nice, neighborhood vibe. Coffee, beer, wine, and pastries/snacks are what you will find here.  The outdoor area is definitely where it's at. Hanging hammock chairs, tables, and an outdoor bar all make it a chill place to hang out. East Side King is right next door and will bring food over to you to eat here. Come and check out Open Mic on Thursday nights for a great rotation of local talent! ", pos 
Irie Bean Coffee Bar ," 11/12/2016 Irie Bean is a great pit stop when you're in a pinch for some brew or need to smash out some work in a low-key cafe. Their cold brew is perfectly decent and complimentary to the weather; nothing fantastic, but sometimes that's the kind of cafe we all need. Kudos for the crossword puzzles on the counter! ", neutral 
Irie Bean Coffee Bar ," 6/6/2015 3 check-ins I can't not do a review for this one.  I also can't about the food here (but I'm sure it's good) coz I didn't try any.  Patio + hammocks + stuff for kids to play with + bar + east side king as neighbors. What does that equate to? Do the math.  Patio = totally cool. Hammock = totally hipster. (Patio + hammock) = amazing.  Stuff for kids to play with = win. Bar = easy way for parents to relax while their kids play. (Stuff for kids to play with + bar) = win win.  East side king = great food. Service = A+.  Add it all up. What does it say??  Amazingly win win situation.  I docked off a star coz the margarita is kinda not very margarita like,and the restrooms remind me of public toilets in Miami beach. (No need to elaborate on that one. )  The best drink here is obviously the watermelon yum yum. It's freshly ground watermelon with moscato garnished with lemon. There's a lot of beers to choose from, they also have rotating. And of course, mimosas for you lovely ladies out there.  I like this place the way it is. Easy, friendly and not trying to be cool. That's what makes it so cool. Watermelon yum yum- watermelon with moscato Hammocks. What!!!! ", pos

Irie Bean Coffee Bar ," 4/4/2016 Would i return - yes, most definitely.   I would get exactly what i got the first time - iced latte.      The hammocks out back were fun.  It was clearly a place where people liked to go and hang out.  Why not 5 stars - although the coffee was low acidity it didn't have the perfect balance of flavor; maybe too much milk?  Also, for the hot latte my husband got, the drink could have been bit hotter, i'm not talking super hot but lets just say closer to 140 degrees. ", pos 
Irie Bean Coffee Bar , 2/26/2016 wow this coffee is so amazing like woah was not expecting it when i walked into this little place on accident it looks like a typical small average coffee shop but the taste is much better than anythig ive had around the area and great prices too! , pos 
Irie Bean Coffee Bar ," 8/29/2016 Best iced Mocha--ever! As a native Austinite (living in Miami now), I tried three different Austin-centric coffee shops when I was visiting a year ago and determined Irie had the best iced Mocha in town.

Thanks for making my Monday that much more delightful. ", pos 
Irie Bean Coffee Bar ," 8/1/2016 Came here for the first time this past weekend for a Sunday date with my boyfriend. What a charming place! Reasonable prices, great selection. I got a pomegranate green iced tea and my BF got a triple shot of espresso. The tea was delicious and my BF is very particular about his espresso and he loved it. Also, the young lady that helped us out was very personable and pleasant to chat with! Great little coffee shop - will definitely return! ", pos 
Irie Bean Coffee Bar ," 1/14/2015 3 check-ins Sweet and patient staff, always helpful and ready with ideas.  Cinnamon horchata with espresso. Can I say MORE please? Also got the juiceland pre-bottled ""recovery punch"" which is good for post hangovers.  Indoor seating is comfortable for a coffee shop, and the outdoor patio they share with East Side Kings is pretty cool with lots of trees and umbrellas for shade and plenty of tables.  Not sure about the wall outlet situation outside though.  My only complaint is that I've been in twice for the horchata espresso drink on the weekends and they've been out.  Not. Cool.  Homemade coffee horchata is not the same Entrance Drink case ", pos 
Irie Bean Coffee Bar ," 7/17/2016 Listed in Kaffe The outside eating area is the neatest thing ever!  Plenty of picnic tables, funky art, and HAMMOCKS which was super exciting to discover!  The inside has really comfy seating and the baristas were super sweet.  My sister and I ordered espresso and it was one of the best ones in Austin, in our opinion.  It was a super relaxed place that made sure you felt welcome.  It also seemed like there were heaps of shops within walking distance which is nice.  Oh, and I'm pretty sure they have live events.  Definitely coming back! ", pos 
Irie Bean Coffee Bar ," 4/27/2016 This place has one of the best environments ever for a coffee shop. Indoors, the counter area is a cool wrap around bar, while high tables flank the walls, and there are a few lower tables. So, you can chill at the bar and talk to the friendly barista, get stuff done on your computer at high tables, or meet with a friend at table in the middle. I've done all three. Outdoors, there are picnic and other tables, some with umbrellas AND . . . wait for it . . . an awesome area with several hanging cloth chairs! They're in, like, a circle, so you can swing with one or several friends and while the day away, or have a casual meeting. Takes me back to my Caribbean days, but I digress. At night they have music, like Reggae Sundays, d.j.s and open mic nights, so night life is covered too. It's a real community type of place. So Irie has every kind of awesome drink: organic teas, iced or hot, delicious coffee and beer and wine. The one thing it lacks is a variety of food options. It has several high-quality (and expensive) bars and bagels, but no real food. But, you know, nothing in life is perfect. ", pos 
Irie Bean Coffee Bar ," 6/1/2015 1 check-in The coolest part about this place was the backyard they have, with a bar. so this place is kind of like a mullet, business in front and party in the back.  Came by here after picking up my husband from the airport. It was finals week and needed a place to study. Since we were eating at East Side Kings we decided to check this place out. Cute little independent spot. Saturday afternoon studying. Uncomfortable chairs - till we moved to the cool facing recliners. I'd come back if I knew I could sit there! lol. Coffee was great, place was quiet except for one weird guy in the back laughing hysterically and talking to himself quite randomly.  At first I thought he was on the phone but then realized, nope, he wasn't. no phone, just his laptop. oh dear... but it is Austin after all. sooooo he fits right in! It's me that's not weird enough!!! ", pos 
Irie Bean Coffee Bar ," 8/31/2015 Super chill local coffee place. Quality wifi, very peaceful vibe, comfortable tall tables with readily available plugins for laptops, etc. It's clear there is a community spirit in this place with a very pleasant, go your own way kind of mood. Whether you're wanting, coffee, tea, beer or something more substantial, it's a great choice. With parking able to overflow into the Chipotle lot next door, you can get a spot, unlike many South Lamar locations. So, all in all, a great place to slow down, work a little, think a little, whatever. Try it. (p.s. you can congratulate me for not using the word ""mon"" or any fake Jamaican-inflected prose in the entire review. It was not easy.) ", pos 
Irie Bean Coffee Bar ," 9/10/2016 I really liked this spot. I'll start off by saying that I did not have any of their coffee drinks, instead I opted for a Naked Juice that they had in a cooler full of drinks to choose from. My husband got their iced coffee, he enjoyed it. The atmosphere is why I'll come back to this shop though.. Inside is a small seating area, but their patio is awesome. They have several hammocks to sit in, along with an outside bar, lights, and some tables and chairs. Super calm vibe to just sit outside and talk with friends, study, or whatever you feel like doing.

They've got a beer and wine license which they use to their full advantage. They've got a long list of ""wine cocktails"" that are really good! The bartender back there is really friendly too. He started a conversation with me that was so out of the blue and deep that for a second I thought he mistook me for another person, but my friends all had the same experience, so I guess he's just super friendly!

I'm not sure who their roaster is but all their coffee tastes *just* slightly over roasted, or it could be that the water used for brewing is too hot and brings out that slightly burned taste. I have bought beans here before and the coffee tastes fine out of my machine. The bags however are priced about normal for one pound although it is actually a 3/4 lb bag.

However...Irie Bean pulls off the Torani syrups rather well. I'm not sure what they do, but their coffee is impeccable. Flavorful and satisfying, with so many unique drinks. Like the mocha coconut for summer and the white chocolate pumpkin spice for the fall. You can't go wrong with coffee here whether it's hot or iced. Soon you'll be able to grab some coffee and grab a bite from East Side Kings next door (coming soon). You can bring your pooch, preferably when the weather is not sweltering hot, and sit outside under the shade trees to enjoy your coffee. From Comedy night to book night and music on their small outdoor stage, you can enjoy it all from Wednesday- Saturday nights. But wait there's more... sorry to sound like an infomercial, but come on you know it's catchy and it makes you listen every time. They serve beer and wine here! Irie Bean even has a daily HH from 4PM- 8PM. Don't forget about Yappy Hour on the last Friday of every month, starting at 7PM. Irie Bean is a great spot to kick back and enjoy some local Austin color. One love specialty coffee. Yum. Brown sugar and cinnamon East side Kings coming soon next door Outside tables ", pos

Irie Bean Coffee Bar ," 10/29/2011 I tried the jerk chicken from Irie Bean at the Gypsy Picnic a week ago.  I was really excited about the jerk chicken because there's a dearth of Jamaican food in Austin, but their jerk chicken is not jerk chicken.  Jerk chicken is spicy on its own and gets spicier with a jerk sauce that is thin, usually like a broth, and freaking spicy.  Their jerk chicken wasn't spicy at all on its own, and while I liked the Hawaiian style bun and slaw, I really just wanted real jerk chicken.    I'd really like to go visit the actual coffee bar though, because jerk chicken aside, it seems like a cool place. ", neutral

Except for the back, there was a huge dog turd in the middle of the back area. You know, it was right in front of the poop bag dispenser. What an inconsiderate pooch. ", pos

She quickly let me know I was better off moving it and that she'd watch my laptop for me. I know that is just common courtesy but I automatically got a good vibe from the place! Free wifi, plenty of seating although it is a small interior space and the coffee is great. Only complaint is the pricing!

Irie Bean Coffee Bar ," 9/25/2013 1 check-in It's a pretty chill place, seems like a really good place for some quiet time. I've seen people 'study' in loud busy coffee shops, but this place seems like a place where you could actually study, not just check Facebook, listen to music and people watch...not that there is anything wrong with that. It's a tad hard to find due to lack of clear signage, next door to the tattoo place and across the street from the Animal Hospital. The door is actually directly under the odd yellow and black lighted sign for te strip mall.

Irie Bean Coffee Bar ," 11/6/2013 The Irie Bean is a favorite hangout of ours with a happy neighborhood vibe and lots of ""regulars"" who are fun to talk with. It's totally kid friendly, dog friendly and well, just all around friendly! The coffee is local and the beer selection is also great, and they host a lot of fun events too.  The indoor part of Irie Bean is cozy with plenty of seating and is great for work/study sessions with music at just the right level to blend with and drown out the steady hum of conversations, but not distract you from your work.  But don't miss the patio, which is much larger than the inside of the coffee shop. Some people don't even look out the back door and they are missing out. They have tons of tables and seating, it's somewhat landscaped and they have a stage and a fun rocket ship sculpture that is so tall you can walk right through it. Kids love it and can draw on the inside with chalk. People bring their dogs.  My only complaint is the smokers, especially because they all sit and congregate right around the door going in/out of the coffee shop so there's no way to avoid them. I wish they wouldn't allow smoking out there or at least would limit it to an area that is set apart from where people have to walk to go in or out. ", pos

Sa-Ten ," 12/1/2016 Was here at 9+am on Sunday and the place was still quite quiet. Had a cup of americano and shared the sriracha mayo smoked salmon toast & yasai toast with 2 friends for breakfast. Since these were served on thick toasts, our order was sufficient to fill us up. I enjoyed both toasts but I would pick the yasai toast if I had to pick one!  It wasn't lunch time yet when we were there, but the lunch menu was made available to our friends. We tried the chicken katsu curry they ordered, and were impressed by the panko fried chicken thigh. The curry was tasty though I think it could have been a bit spicier.  Just a minor grouse: the menu stated that the yasai toast came with asparagus, broccoli, okra, bell pepper, tomato, Kewpie mayo, anchovy garlic oil, mozzarella cheese... But I don't remember getting any bell pepper or okra on ours. Sriracha mayo smoked salmon toast and yasai toast ", pos

Mainly because the front of the building looks like a Warehouse.  Sa-Ten is nested behind the back along with a few other establishments that appears to be galleries.  I drove to ATX from Houston that day for some Franklin's BBQ.  As stuffed as I was, I wanted to stop by Sa-Ten to try their Salmon Toast.  My order came out a tad burnt on the edges but O M G, that was one delicious piece of toast I tell ya!  Why doesn't any Houston establishments offer this?  Let's get with it H-Town!    I also ordered a cup of their house specialty - the Ohayo (brown sugar cappuccino).  Nothing mind blowing about it.  I'd probably try something different on my next visit.  Best part of Sa-Ten?

Sa-Ten ," 9/11/2016 Our friends told us about this place and convinced us to try it. We're glad they did because the food here is delicious! We ordered the Chicken Katsu Plate with kale salad and curry, and the Smoked Salmon Toast.  The Smoked Salmon Toast came with small pieces of salmon on top of a sriracha mayo sauce on brick toast. Pretty pricey at $7.50 for the portion size but yummy indeed.  The Chicken Katsu Plate was probably one of the best katsu we've ever had. The chicken pieces were tender, perfectly seasoned, and had a very crispy coating. The kale salad pairing was very refreshing, and had a unique lemon-y dressing. Even the rice was sprinkled with some type of seasoning that complemented the katsu.  Definitely coming back here in the future to fill our tummies with more yummys!

Sa-Ten ," 9/1/2016 2 check-ins Sa-Ten is great for a casual meal, working from a coffee shop or just hanging out and reading a book.    Their lattes are to die for (they always have a special of the month and they make the syrup and other toppings from scratch there).    Try out any of their toasts and chicken katsu.  Potato wedges with their green chutney will have you coming back for more.    If you're wanting something on the lighter side, indulge in the Sa-Ten salad.  It's so fresh, colorful and seasonal.  Everyone seems to go in and order the Ohayo (I've never had it since it has condensed milk), but in a normal sitting, I'll see at least 10 people order it so it must be good.

Sa-Ten ," 6/27/2016 1 check-in Listed in Weekend in Austin A nice little Japanese coffee house tucked inside an almost factory looking building. Sa-Ten takes the quirkiness of Austin, removes the rowdy crowd and the claustrophobic atmosphere we've grown accustomed to in any downtown establishments, and adds a traditional Japanese flavor into the mix. Excellent place to catch up with friends and to chill in general.  Their specialty here is their giant toasts. We tried out the Chicken Katsu (on rice and toast), the Sriracha Mayo Smoked Salmon Toast, and the Egg, Bacon, and Sausage Toast, all of which were excellent. The toasts were soft and buttery with the ingredients melted on top with cheese. Bonus points for managing to season the toast properly without making them soggy. Simply put, their toasts completely redefined my perception of what a toast dish should look like. They also have 4 sides to go along with the toasts and you can't go wrong with any of them. If you're getting one of the savory toasts, I recommend getting the curry as one of the sides and use it as a dipping sauce. Yum! The portion sizes of the dishes are moderate so don't expect to eat a big heavy meal here.  The place is clean and well-maintained. In addition to the food, they also have a few board games and some authentic Japanese comic books. Again, great environment for a meet up or a date. We would certainly come back more to try out their drinks or just to do some work. Plenty of sitting area. Sriracha Mayo Smoked Salmon Toast ", pos 
Sa-Ten ," 11/12/2016 I've been here a couple times and think it's a great, out of the way location to study or have lunch. Usually, Sa-Ten is pretty deserted since it's tucked away in one of the more remote locations of Austin. The interior has a great homey feeling and there are a couple outlets so you can plug in and study away.  I think the food is pretty good -- a little overpriced, but still decent. I've gotten the lemonade and it's definitely fresh squeezed and very tart, so take advantage of the agave syrup they have next to the utensils and other condiments. Their toasts also make for a great snack and usually come with a side of curry for dipping.  Most recently I went during the East Austin Studio Tour and they had altered their menu and put everything in disposable paper ware with smaller portions, so I wouldn't recommend going whenever it's crowded, service and food will suffer because of it.

When you are in that area of East Austin, there aren't many quality coffee shops. I also like that they sell healthy natural fruit and nut bars. Sometimes I am ""on the go"" and I just need a little pick-me-up. ", pos 
Sa-Ten ," 11/3/2016 1 check-in I got the chicken katsu, with anchovy toast, kale salad, and curry.  The curry had radishes in it and was so fresh.  The kale salad was lemony and perfect.  The chicken was moist and crispy.  I called in the order to go and the person on the phone said it would be 10 minutes.  25 minutes later, I got my food.  After asking after it twice.  Maybe not the best place for quick, but it is for good food.  I had already had my coffee, but it smelled like good caffeine in there, so next time... ", pos 
Sa-Ten ," 6/30/2016 I have been wanting to try Sa-Ten (I always want to say the name the wrong way) and finally got the chance when I had a training near by! I was definitely not disappointed. I strictly went for the food, but I heard their drinks are just as great!  Food was fresh and for the amount you get, totally worth the $10. I give the Chicken Katsu plate a 8/10. It comes with rice and 2 sides. I got curry and macaroni salad, but I honestly should have ordered 2 sides of curry because it's so darn good! I've been looking for a place that has authentic Japanese curry and Sa-Ten is the closest to my experience in Vegas. The only thing that would have made this plate a 10/10 was that the chicken was a little on the dry side. Other than that, the plate itself was delightful!  I'll definitely be back again to eat their Chicken Katsu and curry! This plate is a little heavy, so you might want a coffee to wake you up from the afternoon slumps :p Chicken Katsu with curry and macaroni salad ", pos 
Sa-Ten ," 4/29/2016 1 check-in Atmosphere/ Location: Located behind a warehouse looking building. It was hard to find but we eventually got there! The lights inside are pretty dim and there's outdoor seating available.  Food: The food was a lot better than I expected. For the price, they really give you what you ordered. But the Sriracha Mayo Smoked Salmon Toast didn't live up to the hype.. it tasted a bit fishy and dry. But I'll give it a try again next time. I got the honey ginger pork dish with the rice which was super flavorful. I enjoyed every bite although the dish got cold pretty fast. The girl behind the counter recommended I do the toast instead of the rice with my dish- I wish I had tried the toast instead. The rice came out pretty but it was just a lot of rice. My friend got the Chicken Katsu Curry and she loved it also. It looked pretty soupy and warm!  Service: The service is pretty fast and they bring the food to you. The water dispenser is located on the side of the store so you can easily help yourself also! Like I said, the girl behind the counter was kind and made recommendations to the first-timers.  Time: The food came out relatively fast for the amount of food we got. I was pretty impressed. ", pos 
Sa-Ten ," 3/21/2016 1 check-in I really love Sa-Ten, from the atmosphere, to the decor, to the food, to the drinks. I came on a Saturday morning for brunch around 11. It was quiet and it just felt really chill and relaxed. There were some people eating and chatting, some people drinking coffee and studying, some people just picking up drinks to go. You order at the counter and pay there before you get the food.  We were there for the lunch menu, and I got to try the chicken katsu, smoked salmon toast, and nori-tama toast. Everything was delicious!! The chicken katsu was tender and juicy, with a nice crunch, but it didn't feel too oily. The sides were yummy too- I liked the potato salad and the macaroni salad the most, but the kale salad was good for an acidic kick to break up the creaminess of the other sides. I also really liked the rice, which is super important in Japanese food!  The smoked salmon toast and nori-tama toast were also delicious. They use thick cut Japanese style toast, and the crunchy/soft texture of the bread worked perfectly with the creamy toppings. I want to try the me so honey toast next time too!  I also tried the coconut matcha latte and the matcha chai latte, which were both delicious and not too sweet.  Another plus- parking is ample :). Even though the atmosphere here is distinctly Austin, the food is authentically Japanese, and the combination is a definite win in my book!

Sa-Ten ," 10/13/2016 1 check-in Lunch specials is where it's at.  Chicken katsu curry and karage are both filling.  Mac or kale salad are both good. I think the breakfast stuff can be overpriced.  I like that this place has plenty of parking and that it's pretty quiet.  Quiet, friendly and low key.  I hope the hip and trendy people stay away and go to Thunderbird and all. ", pos 
Sa-Ten ," 4/28/2016 What an interesting little coffee shop! The boyfriend and I discovered Sa-Ten while traveling from Houston to Hamilton Pool. We just wanted a light (and delicious) breakfast and this place did not disappoint!  Sa-Ten is tucked away in what seems to be former truck loading docks so it is pretty easy to miss. Once inside the cafe it's really hard to not notice how gorgeous the whole place is. The wood accents, large windows to allow sunlight to come in, and little antique features all come together to give out this hipster (but not pretentious) vibe that just feels so warm and peaceful. The antique TV converted into a fish tank is a cute little feature. It seems like a great place to study or relax and read a book, but not sure how this place gets when it's not a Monday morning.  As for the food - Sriracha Mayo Smoked Salmon toast (5/5): I'm not a big fan of fish, especially when it's barely cooked like smoked salmon, but I enjoyed this dish. The sriracha mayo is lost in the fish, but i'm sure that without that and the mozzarella cheese then this dish would have been way more fishy. The bottom of the toast was burnt, but I could barely taste it.  Nori Tama toast (5/5) - This dish was so delicious! The egg spread was light and had a distinct mayo taste to it, but it was very delicious. Who would of thought that egg spread, mozzarella cheese, and seaweed would blend so well together? My boyfriend has officially made this a staple for his future visits to Austin.  Overall, little coffee shops like this are hidden gems that should be discovered by everyone!

Sa-Ten ," 4/25/2016 This place has so much aesthetic dimension that you/ll want to take instagram pictures of the entire cafe. It's modern and full of rustic accents everywhere, and you'll find people here studying / eating / quietly chatting away. I find it a bit too cold for hardcore studying, but it's a great place to catch up on some reading or write papers. Most of the lighting is natural, so it's definitely bright enough to work on your homework, but I find that the air conditioning is a bit too chilly if you plan to stay for several hours (my boyfriend and I both ended up catching a cold from staying here for 4 hours, oops). One downside for me is that the chairs are metal and either don't have back support (stools) or have bad back support (not the best thing to lay back on for too long) TL;DR: if you're not picky on chairs and can tolerate a cooler environment, this place is a great place to study.  As for the food, I think it's decently good. The portions aren't large, but they should fill you up enough if you aren't starving. The value and quality of the food don't really justify the prices, so I don't come too often for the food's sake. But from time to time, I find myself coming back when I'm looking for the perfect hipstery cafe that has above average ""cafe food"". If you're really hungry or craving a really scrumptious meal, Sa-Ten isn't what you're looking for. The chicken katsu is a little dry, the salmon toast is yummy but the salmon sometimes can be so itty-bitty, and the rice feels more as a little side rather than a filler. The drinks are solid but overpriced as well.  I don't mean to sound like a harsh critic, because I really do enjoy going to Sa-Ten. If you're willing to spend a bit of money, you'll have a great time at a neat little place in Austin that's great for studying and/or snacking with friends. I think that for the atmosphere and the type of food you can get at a cafe, Sa-Ten does a good job. ", pos 
Sa-Ten ," 9/6/2016 1 check-in Can't speak for the drinks but service was quick and friendly, and the lunch was delicious.  I had a delightful chicken katsu with macaroni salad and curry as sides.  Only minor critiques would be that the curry could be spicier, I like some heat, and the macaroni salad was a tiny bit dry.  Would totally come back again!

Sa-Ten , 4/9/2016 1 check-in I wish this place wasn't in the middle of no where in East Austin... literally so far away from campus.  This is my go to spot for the Japanese katsu curry and kale salads! I'm usually not a kale person but their kale is SO GOOD!  Japanese katsu curry: 4/5 - the curry is pretty good and katsu itself is delicious. Kale salad - they use a lemon vinaigrette that tones down the flavor of the bitter kale.  The place gets busy during finals because I guess people like studying here since it's so lonely and quiet. katsu curry , pos 
Sa-Ten ," 2/24/2016 Listed in Affordable, but Quality Brunches in Austin, Cutest Cafes in Austin The combination of coffee, brunch, and Japanese is unexpectedly genius. Not only that, but the environment is comfortable for studying, lunch or coffee with a friend, or to play the board games they have available to customers. For me the distinguishing factor about Sa Ten is that it satisfies this variety of cravings.  I tried a latte and salmon toast - not the best combination I will say, but both individually tasted great. The salmon toast is savory and has a good spicy kick to it that adds a lot of flavor. The latte isn't the best I have had but it's good enough to make me return here.  The location feels kind of remote or out of the way but that is one of the nice things about Sa Ten - it really gives off that hidden, secluded vibe that is refreshing when you live in such a big, busy city.  There are endless outlets for studying, and free wifi, so I can imagine spending a day studying or catching up on work here.  For the Instagrammers, this place is also perfect for those overhead food pics. ", pos 
Sa-Ten ," 8/11/2016 1 check-in UM YUM! I'm so glad I found this place while I was at emancipet. First time I came in I just had their iced lavender honey latte and it was good. Wasn't OMG DELICIOUS but pretty tasty. I was more impressed with the location and the ambience of the place.  Looks like a great place to get work done. Always seems really quiet and multiple people getting busy on their laptops. I also really love how it's across buildings from art galleries. A hidden gem. Seems like a cute date spot.  So when I finally came back, I had their chicken katsu and it was DELICIOUS. Perfectly crispy yet the meat was still tender. Really enjoyed the sauces on top as well (BBQ and something?) AND the cute square shaped rice with purple stuff on top. Yum. The worker that took my order recommended the kale salad and macaroni for sides but I went with the macaroni and potato salad. Both solid choices. This time I also tried the special matcha latte with the lavender honey syrup (recommended by the worker) and it was alright. Not very sweet and had a lot of powder on the bottom that made my teeth green.  I will definitely come back for the food but the only downside I see is the place itself being really quiet. I came here with friends and we felt obligated to eat outside since it's such a study environment. We also came pretty late in the afternoon so maybe during normal lunch hours more people are eating and less studying? Not sure, guess I'll have to come back soon :)  All in all I think the drinks are ok but the food is a 5/5. I need to come back and try the toasts!

Sa-Ten ," 4/12/2016 1 check-in Really enjoyed this place :)  I was in town for a weekend conference and saw that I had Sa-Ten bookmarked from a while ago. Decided to skip an afternoon meeting and head here for a snack. Really cool location - hipster for sure haha. Vibe was great though, with lots of open seating (indoors and outdoors), large windows, and a bright airy feel.  Ordered: - ohayo latte, a brown sugar cappuccino. Very milky and lightly sweetened. - chicken katsu plate with kale salad, rice, and macaroni salad. Really interesting sauces on the chicken katsu: Worcestershire sauce and tar-tar sauce? All the flavors were great though and it was really filling for the price.  My total was ~$16 which for the amount of food, was a great value. I would try a different coffee next time; maybe another house specialty! Chicken Katsu plate and Ohayo Latte ", pos

I'll have a repeat visit sure enough! ", pos 
Sa-Ten ," 2/29/2016 This place lives up to its hype! I think it's interesting how this cafe is kind of in the middle of a random isolated area. There's an art gallery across from it and the whole areas just gives off a very artsy, calm, and hipster vibe.    I went there for lunch last Friday and it was really good. I got the sriracha mayo smoked salmon toast lunch plate with the kale salad and Fuji macaroni salad. And I believe my friend got the chicken teriyaki one. I thought the presentation of the plate was super cute and simple.  The toast was thick and soft, and the sriracha mayo was creamy, but without being overbearing. The smoked salmon pieces were pretty good too. I can see why everyone likes their toast so much! I also really loved the two sides a lot! Usually restaurants will drown their salads with dressing and have a ton of mayo in their macaroni salads, but Sa-ten does it super minimalistic. It felt so clean and healthy while I was eating them. The Fuji macaroni salad was on point. I tried a little of my friend's chicken teriyaki and while it was good, it was a bit dry? I feel like there could've been more sauce put on it.  When the food first came out, I thought that I wouldn't be full at all. But it's surprisingly more filling than you'd think it'd be. I left super satisfied and happy! Definitely will go back to try some of their other things like the chicken katsu sandwich which looks really good in the pictures I've seen on Yelp.

Sa-Ten ," 1/31/2016 2 check-ins This place would have been an amazing spot to study at if I were still at college. A short 10 minute drive from campus, this place is hidden next to what seems like an art gallery.  Usually, coffee shops serve the usual pastries and bagels, but never had I had the pleasure of amazing food and amazing coffee. I got the Chicken Katsu, the salmon toast, and an ohayo drink.  The Katsu came with two sides, I chose curry and macaroni salad. The curry was very tasty, but I feel like there wasn't enough rice for both the Katsu and the curry. I ended up dipping some of my Katsu in the curry which was a good combination.  The salmon toast was also terrific, and everyone I know always Instagrams pictures of this. It was well worth the hype as it was AMAZING.  The coffee was slightly bitter and full flavored. Delicious coffee. If you want something sweeter go for the iced saifa.  I'm coming back here for more for sure. Strawberry toast with marscapone cheese. A+ ", pos 
Sa-Ten ," 5/17/2016 Coolness on a stick!  Modern industrial architecture surrounded by art galleries in every direction.  GOOD coffee.  Their custom drinks lean heavily on brown sugar, like brown sugar in a Vietnamese Iced coffee and brown sugar in a short espresso.  What's not to like about that?  Decent solid food.  Not a destination dinner but great ""study"" fare.  Good cold katsu sandwiches.  Messy yummy egg salad sandwiches.  (My co-eater put in a silent protest about the quality of the egg salad sandwich.  I got to eat hers and was happy to do so.)  LOTS  OF PLAIN GRILLED VEGETABLE SIDES.  How often do you get to drink a good latte, munch on freshly grilled asparagus, and work on your computer in a cool industrial room with lots of natural light?  And with all the art and sculpture in the neighboring galleries,  you can pretend to be cutting edge  even if all you are doing on your computer is reading Taylor Swift's personal grooming tips.  Still, with all the graphic excellence and next wave sensibility all around you,  you probably want to bring up your game to the next level.  Bring your Louise Gluck or Suji Kim,  put Glenn Branca or Charming Hostess on your headset,  and stick some experimental films on your computer as background while you read.  Life is good. ", pos 
Sa-Ten ," 11/3/2015 1 check-in Situated in a renovated old warehouse plaza, Sa-Ten is a hipster cafe that serves Japanese-inspired coffee and food. Despite of the interesting concept and the perfect brunch, Sa-Ten is unfortunately marred by its high prices.  My drink of choice was the signature Ohayo, the brown sugar cappuccino named as ""good morning"" in Japanese. At a standard size of $4.50, Ohayo would be good if it were labeled as a regular latte, but the interesting concept of a brown sugar cappuccino did not distinguish itself from its taste. The sriracha mayo smoked salmon toast was a flavorful delight with baked cheese topped with small pieces of smoked salmon, but the price of $7.99 was  staggering.  The ambiance and the service were top-notch, and the outdoor plaza patio makes it a good place for a hangout in a good weather. Unfortunately, I cannot recommend Sa-Ten other than a venture to resolve curiosity because the food quality and portion were not proportional to the price level.  --- tl;dr version: 1) Interesting concept of Japanese coffee cafe 2) Overpriced food Smoked salmon toast Ohayo - Brown sugar cappuccino Big sign in the old warehouse wall ", neutral 
Sa-Ten ," 4/18/2016 1 check-in Wow!  Sa-Ten was a pleasant little surprise.  I came for some coffee and left stuffed from the food.  First off, this coffee shop\eatery is in a cool location next to some art galleries in buildings that were once warehouses?  The parking is actually what used to be the truck loading docks.  It looks like the area is still being built out and leased so it will probably only get better although possibly more crowded.   So we started off ordering our coffee drinks.  I had to go with the house specialty Ohayo and a Mocha.  The Mocha was a tiny bit sweet for my taste, but if you like the sweetened Starbucks type coffee drinks you will like the Mocha here.  More for those that have their sweetener with a splash of coffee.  The Ohayo was good though. Next the food.  Chicken teriyaki kara-age, Nori Tama Toast, and a honey butter toast with a side of potato salad and kale salad.  I'm not usually a huge fan of potato salad, but this potato salad was creamy and quite a treat.  It reminded me of a mix between potato salad and mashed potatoes.  There was no overpowering taste of Mayo and no raw large chunks of potato like some potato salads have.  The Kale Salad had a nice vinaigrette over it.  The chicken kara-age was tender on the inside with a crunchy batter on the outside.  Teriyaki sauce drizzled on the outside.  Decent size portion of Chicken for $6.  The Nori Tama was like having a deviled egg on top of a piece of toast with cheese.  It sounds a little weird and possibly unappetizing, but trust me, it all comes together. The honey butter toast, I don't know if this is supposed to be considered a dessert or snack, but either way, it was amazing.  My wife found that dipping this in the coffee hit the spot for her.  I thought just eating it straight up was tasty.  I don't think it matters how you eat it, you're going to like it. A lot of people seem to come here to grab a snack and a coffee and work on their laptops which is cool.  The one thing I'll say is seating is somewhat limited and tables are basically able to fit 2 people.  There were a couple of people in there that were by themselves and using the other chair at the table for their backpacks which I found a bit inconsiderate when they see people looking around for chairs (some tables had 1 chair only so if people would put their backpack on the floor someone else could use the other chair to actually sit in at another table).   There is bar seating around with the same thing going on there.  A lot of single people sitting in the bar stools every other spot leaving only 1 spot in between.  As the place starts getting busy, have some consideration and move over where there is at least 2 stools in between you and the next person!

I don't make it down/over here often, but it's Spring Break and my precious snowflake is attending spider monkey camp at nearby Austin Bouldering Project. I counted this as a perfect opportunity to start attacking my bloated Bookmarked list of awesomeness east of IH35. Mission #1: lunch at Sa-Ten.  Even though it's practically across the street from the gym, I had a bit of a hard time finding the place. You turn into this sort of industrial looking warehouse complex with a couple of art galleries & little shops, head around to the very back and left, and there you see the actual windows and entrance for the shop. It's styled in that very popular rustic contemporary kitch vibe, which might annoy me a bit except it's just so pleasant inside. Not too crowded, free wifi, plenty of indoor & outdoor seating, books & games to play, friendly staff. If I lived nearby, I'd probably be here every day.  Let me just get this out of the way. BEST COFFEE EVER! My cafe au lait was a revelation. Apparently, local bean supplier Casa Brasil has made a pact with Beelzebub to come up with the most delicious beans roasted in the most perfect way to be expertly brewed by Sa-Ten and paired with cow juices. Good lord, I'm having special feelings just remembering that cup.  I tried the lunch special salmon toast with curry sauce for dipping and a kale salad as my strengthening meal before a grueling afternoon at SXSW free shows. Yeah, the salmon is a bit strong tasting, but I didn't mind at all and ate every morsel of the toast & curry. The kale salad would have been fine if I'd had more time for chewing, but the music was calling and I had to run.  The coffee had me fiending and returned again the next day for another fix. The place was empty at 8am on a Friday morning. If you're one of those lucky work-from-anywhere types, this could be your sweet spot. ", pos

Sa-Ten ," 9/3/2016 So lucky to have this cafe / eatery in my neighborhood. This is a go to spot that always offers, fresh, delicious eats that are very flavorful. My go to is the kale salad with chicken or the Katsu with rice, curry, and grilled veggies. So super yum. I wish the coffee was a bit less dark / bitter, but I do like the macchiato set. They used to give you a Hershey's kiss with the set but not anymore. Sad face.  Also, depending on how much of an ""Austin is over"" mood I'm in, it can be either humorous or soul-sucking to overhear conversations from developers about the next historic house they'll tear down to build the next best restaurant. I swear to God - EVERY TIME.  This is not Sa-Ten's fault that their clientele is typically of the rich California developer set, but it does affect the ""ambience"" per se.  P.S.

Sa-Ten ," 8/17/2015 One of the nicer coffee houses/cafes I've ever been too. The atmosphere is a little hipster/rustic and the place is a little hidden which adds to the allure of this place.  They have a decent selection of food and we decided to try the sriracha mayo smoked salmon (with potato salad and macaroni salad) and chicken katsu (with curry and kale salad).  Our food came out and you immediately are drawn to how nice the plating is; and it's something you don't usually expect from small cafes. The salmon was over toast and had great flavor; I would've liked a little less toast as the slice was pretty thick. I also was not a fan of the potato salad as it had an off flavor that I am not use to. Seems like it was Japanese potato salad which I'm not an expert in, but it is not my cup of tea. The chicken katsu is some of the best I've had. It was suggested to us to get curry as one of the sides and it turned out to be good advice.  Definitely recommend!

Some of them really liked the macaroni, and I really liked the potato salad and curry, especially mixing the rice with the curry. The katsu itself was super tender and flavorful! The only side we didn't really like that much (or just didn't show it) was the kale salad. To me, it was pretty sour.  They also have special drinks like the toasted coconut matcha latte (or something like that) that was really good. There was also a blood orange something oolong that was very subtle.

Sa-Ten ," 8/25/2016 I'm in love with this little Japanese coffee house, it's walking distance to my office and hasn't disappointed me yet. The Lunch menu has some great options.  I have had the Chicken Katsu with macaroni salad (just ok imo) and curry (so good), Honey Butter Toast. I've never loved Kale so much before - their kale salad can be a bit salty but I wouldn't change it. But my go-to favorite is the lunch special Yakitori Bowl - see pic. This is the perfect lunch and it doesn't get old - in fact it's hard to try new things bc I always get this. The combination of flavor is fantastic and the presentation, even to-go is perfect.

Sa-Ten ," 3/8/2016 HIPSTER. If you asked me to describe this place in one word, that would be it. Located in what seems to be an artist colony, Sa-Ten is a fusion of Japanese cuisine and a classic Austin cafe.  Drinks: I had the Ohayo and although it was pricey, ~$5 with tip, it was a pretty darn good latte. Would I get it again? Naw, not worth the price.  Food: Chicken teriyaki toast lunch plate is a good amount of food. You get fried teriyaki chicken (bit dry) , cheese toast, and 2 sides. I opted for the kale salad and macaroni salad which were both super refreshing! I've ordered the Sriracha mayo smoked salmon toast here which I also think isn't worth the price. You get the tiniest piece of smoked salmon on toast.  Ambience: quiet with a small amount of chatter between other customers, plenty of seats, natural lighting, and soothing music played in the background. I would totally study here I liked studying somewhere other than my bed. Also A+ for plenty of large parking spaces!  Overall 4/5 because some items on the menu are overpriced for what you get. Ambience is great for studying or meeting up with a friend. Chicken teriyaki toast lunch plate ", pos 
Sa-Ten ," 10/5/2015 Updated review 1 check-in Listed in Austin Eats on a College Budget When I'm at Sa Ten I feel like I'm in a desert.  It's a good feeling; it's as if I've escaped the hustle and bustle of university and sought refuge in a very aesthetically-pleasing café. I love how the place looks. It feels so modern with their tall wooden doors and steel bar stools. Industrial. Sleek. But also inviting.  But you don't really care about how the place looks right? How was the FOOD? I had the chicken katsu sandwich ($6). They remind me of cucumber sandwiches because the crust is sliced off and their sauce is refreshingly cool (kewpie mayo, yogurt, and Worcestershire sauce combo??). However, I found the chicken to be a little dry. Could have used more sauce maybe? The green onions on top was good because it added a nice flavor! On the side are 3 pickled veggies (pickle, okra, carrot). I like pickled vegetables but if you don't like pickles...you probably won't like these.  My boyfriend had the teriyaki curry chicken toast ($7.50). The toast was thick and tasted like delicious carb-y goodness. There was more of a distinct flavor than the chicken katsu. I can see why their toast is more expensive!  The overall atmosphere is very conducive to working. It's quiet and they have nice relaxing instrumental music. They also have cards, jenga, and some board games. We sat outside (they have a counter with barstools and 3 tables outside) because the weather was so nice. I felt like I was looking at the desert because I was looking out to the sandy rocky ground..yeah okay I don't know I'm weird.  My boyfriend and I have vowed to return to try their lunch/dinner menu! and that special latte of theirs... Cold Chicken Katsu ($6) Teriyaki Curry Chicken Toast ($7.50) ", pos 
Sa-Ten ," 7/6/2015 12 check-ins Sa-Ten is a hidden gem in East Austin and I am so glad I came across this place. Sa-Ten has quickly become my favorite coffee shop in Austin for numerous reasons.  One, Sa-Ten is located in a really neat environment that has a nice aesthetic exterior. The ambience feels very modern and there are about three or four tables for outside seating. Second, the interior is equally as nice. Again, the interior has a very modernized Japanese vibe, which I absolutely love because it is so unique from other coffee shops in ATX. The big windows also provide a plethora of natural sunlight and significantly add to the modern ambience. Third, the coffee is amazing! I have had the cold brew and vanilla latte. Both were delicious and a great caffeine boost for rough mornings. Fourth, the food here is surprisingly really good. I say ""surprisingly,"" because most coffee shops I have been to have mediocre food. Sa-Ten serves a lot of various Japanese food and snacks. I would highly recommend the toast, which comes in a variety of flavors.  I come here at least once a week and I never regret it. Thank you for being the best coffee shop in ATX, Sa-Ten.

Sa-Ten , 1/31/2016 3 check-ins Coffee shop with good food?? Oh my have I found a gem. I throughly enjoyed this cute little place. I love that there are tons of parking spaces versus a ton of other coffee shops in Austin.  I tried the salmon toast and the chicken katsu with potato salad and macaroni salad. The salmon toast is absolutely delicious cheesy flavorful goodness. Get it. No question. The chicken katsu was also very good. It was crunchier than most katsus I've had but I enjoyed it. The macaroni salad is what surprised me. Think potato salad instead of Mac and cheese. It had slices of apple and cucumber in there and was very refreshing. The actual potato salad was more like a mashed potato. My BF got a curry side and I really liked it. The sides were definitely on the lighter side which complimented the dish as a whole wonderfully. Oh and the rice...I don't usually care for rice but this rice had some kind of seasoning on it and it was bomb.  I got the iced saifa for coffee. It was basically Vietnamese coffee meets vanilla latte. Aka delicious. My BF got the ohayo and that was also great. Is there anything here that's not? Will be frequenting this spot more. So glad I finally came here. , pos

Sa-Ten ," 8/27/2016 This may be one of my favorite places of 2016. I've been hankering for some katsu (chicken or pork) and stumbled upon this place whilst reading an article about Paul Qui. Considering I live on the eastside and never heard of this place, I figured I'd give it a shot. I ordered the Chicken Katsu with rice and curry along with the chicken karaage.  Let me just say, this place knocked it out of the park. I was impressed with how massive the portions were and it came with a kale salad included. Bruh, I was feeling like Beyonce when one of her 50 songwriters pitched her the song ""formation."" Sa-Ten is a solid standout with a great ambience in a really neat part of town.

Sa-Ten ," 6/16/2015 1 check-in What a delightful Coffee House/ Cafe with Japanese inspired eats!  Came here last Saturday to grab a quick late lunch. They have seats set up inside & outside, but we opted to seat inside because it was sooo hot out! Also, plenty of parking in the lot.  The eats: A variety Japanese inspired thick toast (topped with teriyaki curry chicken, smoked salmon, nori & tama etc.) Make it into a lunch set & choose two sides from kale salad, potato salad, fuji apple & mac salad (very refreshing) and Japanese curry.  We had the teriyaki curry chicken toast with the lunch set. Teriyaki curry chicken with melted cheese & topped with Japanese pickles. Tasty chicken and scrumptious sides. This set may look small, but can definitely be filling with the thick toast. A little on the pricy side, but I have seen similar prices at bubble tea establishments (thick toast is a big thing in taiwan).  Next up, we had the chicken katsu set. The chicken katsu was delicious and breaded just right! The best part had to be the katsu! The set comes with a square block of rice. If you decide to order the side of curry, there probably won't be enough rice for you to mix!  Overall, a comfortable, fun place to hang out! A little deep into east austin, but worth the adventure.

Sa-Ten ," 12/12/2015 2 check-ins Sa-ten is what happens when you combine hipster Austin with trendy Japanese coffee shops.  Location: It's a little out of the way for UT students, but I definitely feel this is a great place to hang out, study and relax because it's quiet and spacious. Interior decor is so cute and cozy with lots of space for groups. There's also an area with board games.    Food: The toast items are really good (particularly the Sriracha Smoked Salmon). I've also gotten the breakfast yogurt ($7), which had a small portion and was quite average.  Drinks: I've only tried the Ohayo and Lavender Mocha. Both drinks are delicious, but I would definitely recommend the Lavender Mocha more because the lavender really stands out. On the other hand, the Ohayo, which is a cappuccino with brown sugar, didn't really taste that unique considering it was a house special. I didn't really taste the brown sugar at all.  Price: This is probably Sa-Ten's downfall. It's definitely a bit pricey considering the portions you are getting. But really, with the combination of great atmosphere and good food/drinks, it's worth the occasional splurge. ", pos 
Sa-Ten ," 6/27/2016 1 check-in Delicious menu, cute decor, and very chill vibe. I came here on a Sunday evening to get dinner and chat with friends. Sa-Ten is located in a remote warehouse area in east Austin next to a couple of art galleries. There was plenty of parking, and plenty of seating inside. Everything is very industrial-looking- exposed concrete, unfinished high ceilings, a lot of metal, etc. I ordered the chicken katsu with rice, with side items of curry and macaroni fuji salad. The portion was just right- I finished all of it and did not feel hungry or too full. I feel like if you order the chicken katsu, you HAVE to order the curry because they go so well together ( I just poured the curry over the chicken and rice). The macaroni salad was not bad either. I also tried the lemonade and it was delicious and refreshing. The decoration is very cute- they have plants in little Japanese cans, a fish tank TV, little squirrel patterns on the wall, interesting lightbulb lights...it's all a lot to take in and would be the perfect place to have lunch or coffee with friends.

Sa-Ten ," 9/5/2016 First time here in Austin and came across the reviews so I tried it out myself. I ordered the sriracha mayo smoked salmon which was actually pretty good. And then I went on ordering the drinks that they had. They were some odd drinks and we didn't finished them but I had a good laugh with my friend while trying it. My friend ordered the ""Spicy Ginger Brew"" and was wondering why it was so spicy. Here I am looking at him asking, "" Are you serious bruh? It says spicy."" Haha pretty cute place too.

Sa-Ten ," 6/7/2015 1 check-in Listed in ATX Coffee Fix Love the concept of this coffeeshop--I feel like I've been transported to Japan though I've never been before.  Located in deep East Austin, it's quite a drive from where I live but it was well worth it. The eclectic decor is a treat in itself with squirrel wallpaper and a old tv set used as a fish tank...that's a first. There's also succulents on every table potted in tin cans (what a novel idea!).  I ordered their macchiato/espresso set which came with a cute tin tray lined with newspaper from Japan (talk about the details!) and a mini-spoon for stirring. That all came to an approximate total of 3 dollars--reasonable in my opinion. The food was also tasty though small for 7+ dollars. They offer a variety of open-faced toasts--the one I chose was with smoked salmon that was precut to four slices making it very easy to pull apart into bite-size pieces. When I make another stop here, I'll probably stick to just the coffee knowing that the food is a little steep for my taste. ", pos

Sa-Ten ," 10/11/2015 6 check-ins Listed in Cawfee & Tee In my language Sa-Ten means ""Ours"" and immediately I found myself liking this place. To me it has become a semi-sanctuary where I can be at peace. There seems to be an unwritten rule, like walking into a library, that one must pick up their feet when they walk as to not make extra noise, and not to speak too loudly. Which is not to say that people don't or are discouraged to talk here. In fact I've seen many groups collaborate on projects, however, everyone seems to be aware that this is a quiet zone.  The karaage is a favorite of mine and it's the only food item I've tried on the menu just because I always order it instead of trying something else. I'm going to have to break that habit.  It has never been crowded, they have a pretty good sized seating outdoors as well, a bar top set alongside the railing. I come here to get away from the noise of the city, I'm glad its out of kind of out of the way, and isn't easily seen from the street.  The interior design is pleasing to the eye. It is stylish but not overbearingly trendy nor minimalist. The decor is tasteful, warm and welcoming yet not one of those cozy cafes you find yourself falling asleep in. There's a good amount of parking. ", pos 
Sa-Ten ," 7/2/2016 I'm a wee bit of a Japanophile and this was exactly what I needed in my hood! I've only been for dinner, but they have a great variety of homestyle Japanese dishes that is a refreshing break from your standard teriyaki.  I had the vegetable curry plate, which was delicious and so filling I could not eat the tasty side salad it came with. Very fresh-tasting, perfect sticky rice, sauce almost made me lick the plate. I look forward to returning on a day off for a toast lunch and coffee.  Further bonus points- very cute space, friendly staff, tons o parking, tucked away locale so no crazy crowds, fun variety of Japanese and other reading materials. ", pos 
Sa-Ten , 10/8/2015 Cute cafe in a more remote area of East Austin.  I love their home style pork cutlet plates and other hot foods they have here. The coffee is a bit bland for my taste.

Cold brew coffee: more concentrated than average and very good. There's a choice of cream or soy milk.  Black iced tea: decent, I am not a tea snob (not like my dad anyway) but this is definitely not Lipton. First refill is free; refills after that are $1.

Sa-Tén is such an interesting place - the environment is warm and comfortable, especially on this chilly Austin day, with large windows that light up the room with sunshine. Plenty of table and bar seating, quiet, perfect for catching up with a friend, studying, or reading, all while enjoying some coffee and unique Japanese snackage.  THE FOOD/DRINK:  + Sriracha Mayo Smoked Salmon Toast ($7.50) - smoked salmon, sriracha mayo, mozzarella cheese, green onion, and strips of dried seaweed on a thick piece of toast - crunchy on the outside, soft and fluffy on the inside. The sriracha mayo is not too heavy, but adds a kick and went perfectly with the super tender smoked salmon. Super, duper delicious. Would order again.  + Nori Tama Toast ($6.00) - THIS WAS SO GOOD: egg salad spread, green onion, sesame seeds, and dried seaweed on toast. The egg salad was creamy, light, and delicious, with a nice nutty flavor from the sesame seeds.  + Chicken Katsu with Curry ($10.00) - Yummy! Strips of super tender, crunchy-breaded chicken, topped with what looked like more of the egg salad spread. The rice that was served with it was fresh and delicious, and even more so with the thick, flavorful, slightly spicy yellow curry sauce. The kale salad was also super crispy and fresh.  + Hot Matcha Chai Latte ($3.75) - For some reason, the 16 oz. cup was only $0.25 more than the 12 oz., so naturally, we got the 16 oz. Maybe it was some sort of question of marginal utility vs. price, who knows? The matcha chai latte was great - even for someone who doesn't normally enjoy the spiciness of chai. The chai spice was not too strong (but still aromatic and present), and puncuated by the slight sweet-bitterness and scent of the matcha. It was really yummy.  Four stars because I think the food here is a bit pricey for the portions you get.  Overall, a really good experience at this cute little coffee shop. If the food doesn't convince you to go, think about the squirrel wallpaper on the walls - the squirrels want you to go. sriracha mayo smoked salmon toast (bottom left), nori tama toast (bottom right), & chicken katsu with curry ", pos

There's not enough hidden away coffee places here in Austin, TX (most places are just too crowded and filled with college students cramming for finals for me) so when I found this little hip, tucked away coffee shop, I knew it would become my go-to.  I've been here a handful of times before I decided to write a review. Every experience has been great! There are PLENTY of parking (+++) and seating (+++).

It's great here, and super consistent. - Potato Salad Sandwich (5/5): I don't even like potato salads. Enough said. - Blueberry Muffin (4/5): Fresh & delicious!  My friend ordered one of the toasts and loved it as well - so those are on my to-try list for sure! And the donuts!!!  Anyways, I love the vibe here.

The food menu is very good and execution is great while blending a lot of asian flare to it. My favorite so far has been the cold chicken katsu sandwich.

Sa-Ten ," 4/15/2016 2 check-ins This review is only for the food. I really want to like the food, but it just doesn't work for me. The presentation is beautiful and the rules are ver stringent, true to its Japanese influence. Substitutions are not allowed, so you must pick from the side options available.  The Chicken Katsu lunch plate just doesn't satisfy the palate.  The breading is dark and oily (rather than tasting light like the Coconut Shrimp at Takara in Cedar Park). It would do well with a couple of lemon wedges, the slice of lemon doesn't do enough to cut through the heaviness of the deep-fry.  The cut of chicken is usually fatty and can be dry at times. It sits really heavy in your stomach.  The vegetable plate is a nice alternative, but to add chicken you oust purchase an entire order of chicken. That takes the lunch bill up to $16 which is a bit rich for lunch.  I'll stick to Fresh of the Truck from now on: better katsu (chicken cut & fry), better service, better price. ", neutral

If you work from home and get distracted by the raucous coffee shop regulars, this is a nice hideaway.  I had the chicken with japanese curry. Though it looked like a smallish portion, I found myself taking some of it home. All the flavors were really fresh and the chicken was done well (lightly fried).

The idea of $7 hipster toast and a $10 chicken-katsu plate seems a little redonk to me, but what caught me by surprise were the unadvertised sandwich plate specials, like the grilled broccoli & grilled potato sandwich. I was genuinely intrigued.  Unfortunately I don't eat on Tuesdays, so I can't tell you how the food is. What I can tell you is my $2.44 pint of drip Casa Brasil was dark and potent, the staff I engaged with were fun and cool, and listening to the kids at the school next door to this renovated warehouse complex was pretty close to a Zen moment. I think we should definitely put Sa-Ten on the list, and come back & try all their food. Um, when's the last time you saw a squirrel coffee cup? It's so weird it's cool.

I was looking for a snack in between lunch and dinner, and this was the perfect size. The toast is very crispy and fresh out of the oven tasting, and the salmon was cooked just right. I also think they sprinkle some roe on the top, and it definitely adds some flavor to the dish.  I think I enjoyed the atmosphere more than the food at this location. It is definitely quieter than a Starbucks and more intimate. They also have these board games you can play, and I stayed and played Monopoly for almost two hours. I think it's a really great place to just hang out or catch up with your friends.

Sa-Ten ," 9/25/2014 12 check-ins Listed in Caffeine Boost I love Sa-Ten.  At $2.15 for a small cup of coffee, their coffee is both affordable and delicious.  They use Casa Brasil, which is one of my personal favorites in regards to roasters in Austin. I've also tried the Ohayo (the house special) and Iced Saifa (similar to a vietnamese coffee) - both of which are fantastic. Just get them. I can't comment on the food too much, but I have tried their salmon toast and it was good!  I appreciate the design and ambiance as well. It's clean and simple, yet still unique and retro. The Japanese influence is clear here, and there's also squirrel wallpaper!! (I freakin' love that.) The service is great, friendly, and unpretentious. Sa-Ten is a good fit for getting work done, meeting up with folks, and unwinding with a cup of coffee, and I think that's even shown by the diverse crowd that comes in here.  Lastly, they've played swing/big band style music the two times I've been here so far. My favorite.  Other pros / info to know: - Parking is easy in the Canopy lot. - Wifi is dependable and fast. - The temperature is actually correct inside. No freezing or being warm. - Plenty of seating: tables, bar height, and couch. ", pos

Their toasts are big, thick slices of buttery bread with the topping of your choice. I got the yasai the first time (cheese, broccoli, tomato, bell pepper, asparagus) and the teriyaki curry chicken the second. I also tried the Sa-Tén salad with grilled veggies, and would highly recommend it! I've had both the macchiato set and the iced saifa to drink. I wasn't blown away by either but not repulsed either. The whole restaurant is so cute though. I saw a lot of people bringing their laptops and working since it is relatively quiet too. Perfect coffee shop environment. Yasai toast Macchiato set ", pos

The staff were very chill and I love the feel of the restaurant. The decor and ambience is quiet and relaxed enough for it to be a great study spot or place to work or catch up with a friend!

Tea Haus ," 12/3/2016 PLEASE open a South or West Austin location! We found this place on a quest to find mint mojito coffee like Philz has. We first tried the Factory which was very disappointing but then we found this spot just on the other side of the building! We drive up here from south Austin multiple times per week. Fun menu options that aren't expected but also aren't weird or pretentious. I love their Sea Salt Creme Coffee. It's crazy good. Also, they make boba RIGHT. Sweet and tacky, but never hard or difficult to chew. My fiance gets the mint coffee which is delicious. My only change I'd request is that when muddling the leaves they try not to break them up into tiny pieces. Or to offer it with a hot drink lid maybe. No big deal though. The milk tea is also great and classic. I had the Thai tea today which was my least favorite because the tea was very weak, but I hope this was just a fluke. The sea salt coffee is still my top pick. Of the servers, one sticks out in particular which is the girl with the purple hair (sorry, I don't think I've caught her name yet!) She's super sweet and knowledgeable about how they make their drinks and what they all taste like. ", pos 
Tea Haus ," 11/28/2016 1 check-in Listed in The Bubble Tea Connoisseur First off, it's important to keep in mind that this a tea shop in the traditional style first and foremost - they serve hot coffees, freshly brewed teas, fresh juices, and some finger foods. It is, for the majority, not a bubble tea shop. I will write primarily about the bubble tea but will adjust my final rating accordingly. Today I deviated from my usual order and got a jasmine milk tea with regular boba.  Authentic flavor - 5/5 stars  This is as authentic as it gets (the window says the teas are 100% organic). This is literally loose leaf tea steeped over hot water, blended with milk and ice on top. It is nowhere close to artificially sweet. This is genuine, pure, high quality tea. This is also the first place I've tried where the milk does NOT overpower the tea! So many bubble tea shops try to overcompensate for the slightly natural bitter taste of tea by putting way too much milk in their teas. Not Tea Haus, though; the natural flavour of the tea is allowed to shine. In fact, I would argue I tasted much more of the tea than the milk. In short, it was perfect.  Boba taste and consistency - 4/5 stars  Pleasantly surprised. They use a natural sweetener (I'm guessing honey?) so you won't taste the sickeningly sweet and sticky goodness of sugar coated boba, but for a store that prides itself on freshness, that makes sense. Consistency is nice, a little chewier than I like but not too tough. I do wish they had given me more, though. There was barely a layer at the bottom of the cup, but I did also order a small, so.....  Menu offerings - 3/5 stars  A little bit of everything, but not enough of any one thing. This can either be taken as a plus or a minus. They have a good selection of loose leaf teas and coffee (their main menu item), but the food, fresh juices, lemonades, and bubble tea are almost an afterthought. I would be interested in trying out the loose leaf teas in combination with some milk/boba, but in terms of bubble tea you're fairly limited; the  grapefruit honey green tea is their only fruit optio. This means, sadly, I probably won't return because I don't really like milk teas (I'm more of a fruit tea person), but what I did drink today was delicious enough that I would recommend you try them out if you enjoy milk teas. Other things to note: get their basil chicken, it's delicious.  Cafe decor and ambiance - 5/5 stars  I am such a sucker for quaint looking cafes. This is what Starbucks would look like if it fused with one of those warehouse coworking spaces that startups like to rent. It's a little unfinished, but that's part of the ambiance. Lots of individuals were sitting around at 5pm on a Monday, tapping away on their computer trying to get work done. Jazzy music plays in the background. It's generally quiet, a space to relax or focus instead of a place to bring a huge group. Even the tables, which can seat six, are taken up by individuals working alone. There are ample outlets (thank god) and speedy wifi.  Final rating - 4/5 stars Jasmine boba milk tea ", pos 
Tea Haus ," 11/21/2016 Stopped by to get something refreshing before heading back to Dallas. Tried out the lychee iced tea which was good - not too sweet which is why I liked it!

Tea Haus ," 11/19/2016 Updated review 7 check-ins Listed in Austin Coffee I want to love Tea Haus as much as I did when it first opened, but it's so hard..I never know what I'm going to get when I come here. Something is always a hit or a miss.  For example, I got the new sea salt Thai tea recently and absolutely loved it - sweet, creamy, but also strong flavor of tea. I raved about how good it was to a friend and she ordered it a week later, and the drink was way too milky and nothing like what I ordered.  Today, I got boba milk tea - a classic and one of my favorite drinks here, and even at first glance, I knew something was off. The color was so dark and it was so watered down. What's worse is the drink was full of tea leaves in every sip. I had to ask them to make a new one, which the barista kindly did. However, the drink still tasted watered down without the creamy taste I remember. This isn't the first time this has happened, and I don't imagine it will be the last.  I know their receipt says that they will remake any drink if it's not satisfactory, but when the milk tea is made in large quantities in advance, there's not much the barista can do. Is it my bad that I keep ordering it, thinking that the third, fourth, fifth time will be the charm? I don't know. But one thing for sure is the need for consistency/quality control. Please, please make sure all the baristas make drinks the same way! :( ", neutral

Tea Haus ," 11/1/2016 1 check-in Wow! Tea Haus is really good! It's nice to have some great milk tea here in Austin. After months (or even a year) or trying to get away from Tapioca House and Coco's Cafe near the UT Campus, this place gets my top list on the milk tea chart!  Some of my favorites are the Honey boba milk tea and the Sea Salt Creme Coffee! The boba is nice and chewy, along with a thin layer of honey to naturally sweeten the drink. The Sea Salt Creme coffee has a nice strong coffee flavor to it.  When it comes to their food, I get nothing else, except the Basil Fried Chicken. Tasting very similar to the Chicken nugget combo at Tapioca House, the quality and flavor of the chicken tastes a lot better here than anywhere else!  There is plenty of seating everywhere, so if you are in the mood to study, enjoy a good book, or chatting with friends, this place is a good place to do all of these things! ", pos

If you're used to good bubble tea in big metropolitan cities (Tokyo, Seattle, LA can be hard to compete with), this is the place you want to check out in this growing little city.    The interior is also just lovely.  Very spacious and welcoming.  Even the message art on their back wall arouses a smile every time I walk in.

Tea Haus ," 9/1/2016 3 check-ins Cute wall mural for your insta wall pics and good coffee/drinks.  Mint Mojito Iced Coffee (4/5) - Fresh and smooth coffee with crushed fresh mint leaves. Nice mix of coffee and mint flavors. Refreshing.  Sea Salt Creme Coffee (4.5/5) - Tea Haus uses Summer moon's coffee, so it's bound to be good. I tried this coffee expecting it to taste similar to 85 C's, but the saltiness was less pronounced, and was more balanced out by the sweetness and creaminess. Overall I'm really happy to find sea salt coffee in Austin.  Strawberry brick toast (3.5/5) - After having toasts at Korean bakeries, this didn't impress me. It was literally a brick of toast that was not toasted, and was drizzled with condensed milk and topped with fresh strawberries. I was looking for a difference in consistency, such as a slightly crunchy toasted exterior contrasted with soft warm interior. Nope. ", pos 
Tea Haus ," 3/29/2016 9 check-ins Pros:  Mojito coffee, basil chicken, and the milk teas are great.  I love that they are open until 10pm most evenings, which seems to be a little later than a lot of the other coffee houses around town.  The restaurant always looks clean and it is in a shopping center with plenty of parking relatively close by.  It seems like a lot of students like to come bring their laptops and work here.  There is a variety of seating choices from small to large tables and a bar along the wall to sit at.  Cons: Brick Toast is a little dry.  Something to give it a more moist overall texture like a pound cake or angel cake would suit me better.  I ordered a musubi once and I think they nuked it way too long because the spam was brown instead of pink, and the rice was crunchy.  Once we went in and the AC was blasting so strong that we needed to sit in our car which was a bummer. Coffee story Outside window Brick toast See all photos from Charles Y. for Tea Haus ", pos

Tea Haus ," 5/6/2016 7 check-ins As far as tapioca goes, Tea Haus is decent. Their drinks are also alright, but there aren't very many choices, so if you're not craving something that's on the menu, you're kind of at a loss. I'm also not a fan of their grapefruit drink - it had little bits of grapefruit zest that didn't add any flavor to the drink in my opinion.  Their hot coffee is pretty average - I ordered a latte once and it was just alright. Nothing special! I think the best item on the menu is probably their sea salt iced coffee.  The general vibe of Tea Haus is a hipster spin off of your regular boba tea spot. I like the large tables in the back, but often find it difficult to find seating here. There are definitely a lot of cute places to take a photo for Instagram though!  This isn't my first choice for studying, coffee, or boba, but it's still a nice place to visit if you're in the area!

Tea Haus ," 4/15/2016 3 check-ins Wow.  How can I say this without overstating just how happy I was with how perfect everything was about my visit?  I don't think I can...but I will try.  Tea Haus is right next door to Phonatic(which is also great in their own right)but I was in the mood to try something I know I have experience with and that is Boba Teas.  Now keep in mind, I grew up in Houston which has a gigantic Asian community and I currently live in Chinatown Houston.  So my experience with Asian teas is pretty good.  There are only 2-3 that I love in the Houston area and the rest are mediocre or they just over sweeten their drinks.  So I order a Jasmine Milk Tea with Tapioca and their signature Strawberry Brick Toast.  The tea was served promptly while the toast took about 10 mins to prepare.  I took one sip of the tea and it was velvety smooth and sweetened just right!  I could taste the tea blend and jasmine without the sweet overpowering the whole thing but the best part?  The boba tapioca.  My goodness, I thought I'd tried the very best before but whatever it is that they do here to the boba I hope they stick to it.  It was PERFECTLY chewy, soft centers and they were sweetened unlike any other tapioca I had tried before.  Now don't get me wrong, other places are good too but Tea Haus' boba has something special going for it and I can't put taste buds on it but I fell in love!  Best Jasmine Milk Tea ever!  Then the brick toast was called.  I walk to the kitchen window to get it and I was amazed at the presentation!  For a moment there I felt like Chef Gordon Ramsey being served some fancy dessert to judge!  It was fat like a brick and covered with strawberries.  Cut a piece and took a bite..  I almost called the moving company to move my stuff into this place because I didn't want to leave!  The toast fast fantastic!  Perfectly toasted and sweet with some sort of buttery texture and the strawberries just made everything pop perfectly together.  You just have to try it yourself.  Now don't be deceived..it looks super sweet like french toast but it's beyond that and the sweetness is perfectly balanced.  Split it with a friend if you're worried about calories lol!  My only complaint is that now when I do have milk tea or any sort of dessert toast I am gonna compare it to this place and it's just too darn far for me to drive to every time I want my milk tea fix!  But if you're local, you should check it out.  It was perfect and the service was super friendly! Would you like to join me in my quarters for some toast? Encarnacion approved!

Tea Haus ," 4/12/2016 1 check-in Another afternoon escape from my weekend conference in Austin.  Ordered: - basil chicken: freshly made and juicy flavors! Good portion size for $5.75. Definitely a decent appetizer at a typical restaurant, but I have been to Taiwanese places that will give you twice the portion for the same price. But this is a ""hipster"" cafe after all, so for this standard - it's worth getting! - sea salt creme coffee: a ton of ice goes into this drink. Initial impression: great flavors, creamy and not too sweet. An hour later when all the ice has melted? Ugh can't even get a sip down. Moral of the story? Drink fast but worth it as well.  Total was less than $10, which was pretty decent. A typical latte and pastry at a coffee shop will also be at least $7.  Decent wifi! Which I always appreciate.

I've heard the lemonades are awesome and I keep meaning to try one, but that black milk tea always calls my name and I can't resist. One day, though, I'm gonna try a lemonade.

Tea Haus ," 5/25/2016 5 check-ins Tea Haus is good.  Let me explain what good means: Good means getting drinks that taste pretty yummy. It means even though the food smells and looks delicious, it's a little bit too pricy to buy all the time. It means when you get coffee, you can tell them to put a little less ice or sugar in, but at the end of the day it's still a fairly mediocre cup of milky coffee. It means their teas are good (and some, like the Jasmine milk tea, is better than others!) - but just a little too watered down even when you ask for light ice, and just doesn't really hit the spot. It means that the boba is deliciously sweetened with honey but just a little undercooked, enough to bother you but not cause you to swear off this place forever.  Good means really nice decor, but once you pass the counter it's quite dark. Good means plentiful space but not plentiful enough seats. It means only some seats have outlets and only some seats are comfy but the ones that got it, got it.  Good means I wouldn't ever be opposed to coming here, but I don't think I would ever crave this place. ", neutral 
Tea Haus , 6/27/2016 The drinks are okay...the boba's decent. It's quite challenging to chew through the hard tapioca. I had their boba milk tea and jasmine tea boba with normal sweetness.

Tea Haus ," 9/15/2016 Tea Haus is located in a strip mall, next to a Walmart. The inside is quite spacious, but rather dimly lit towards the back which doesn't make it ideal for studying. There's also only a couple of outlets, so make sure your laptops are fully charged if you plan on coming here to do work.  Tea Haus's milk tea is really good, but the last couple times I've been it tasted a little lukewarm. I think they might pour their tea in hot since the ice melts really fast and waters down the tea. Their lemonades are also a good choice, since they are freshly squeezed (but quite tart!) ", pos

For food they have 3 things on the menu - basil fried chicken, brick toast and affogato.  Simplicity is winning here at Tea Haus.    I had the mint blueberry lemonade and it was phenomenal!  I was at an UYE and the table had several orders of basil fried chicken and brick toast.  The fried chicken was delicious!  The brick toast was great too!  Everything is freshly made.  Even the drinks are made as you order them.    The atmosphere here has a modern feel and is great for a small get together with friends or studying by yourself.  If you are in the area and looking for a snack and a refreshment definitely stop in here.  If there was a location down south I would definitely become a regular.

Tea Haus ," 9/5/2015 4 check-ins Listed in Favorite Nearby Neighborhood Eats Lemonade I don't think will ever taste the same again after my visit to Tea Haus.  The interior is modern with dark tones that make the atmosphere calm and relaxing.  This is the type of place you can catch up on work, or meet up with people.  I happened to come for the purpose of meeting up with peeps.  They have a streamlined menu, which makes it easy to find something to order.  The focus is on beverages, but they do have a couple of food items. The group ordered Basil Fried Chicken and brick toast which both looked amazing, and everyone raved about.  For us wheat sensitive folk, they did have premade plastic wrapped gluten free items from Russell's bakery at the front counter.    The beverage options range from raw pressed juices by Daily Green, homemade lemonades, a variety of tea and coffee drinks, and Boba milk tea.  I ordered the coconut chia lemonade, and then waited for my order. My drink was the last to come out, as I learned their lemonades are so fresh, they are made as you order.  The wait is worth it though, as the lemonade is definitely one of the best I have ever had. A refreshing drink to beat the summer heat. Coffee beans are thanks to Austin coffee roaster Sumer Moon.

Tea Haus ," 8/27/2015 1 check-in Listed in Treat yo self!, Java Jivin' I'm a coffee person over tea, but I genuinely enjoyed Tea Haus! It's very modern and clean while still maintaining a comfortable atmosphere making it ideal for either working or meeting up with friends.  I came because I was so generously invited to Angie L's UYE. My first instinct was to go with coffee, but I ordered their signature milk tea with honey boba to branch out and try something new. I will be honest and say the drink itself I didn't care for, but if you are a tea person then you will LOVE it. The honey boba balls in the bottom of the drink were killer!! I wanted to order a separate bowl of just those to snack on.  I'm sure they make a delicious cup of joe so next time I'm sticking with that. Plenty of variety on those drinks as well such as lattes made with both Ghirardelli chocolate and caramel, coffee with a sea salt creme, and one of my favorite drinks in the world the Affogato which is normally vanilla ice cream and espresso but here they add caramel and chocolate to it too because why not?  Obviously they have a nice tea selection, but believe it or not they even have creative lemonades like coconut chia with mint. We got to try their basil chicken and brick toast as well. I've always been weird about chicken and hadn't eaten it in a while, so when I got a piece that was fatty that was it for me. Everyone else really enjoyed it though because the spices they use are amazing. Make sure to squeeze the lime on top first to even out the flavors.  The brick toast however was right up my alley. It's a slice of thick toast where the top has been soaked in sweetened condensed milk. Before serving they add sliced strawberries and a dusting of powdered sugar. YUMMMM! Give me that and a coffee and I'm one happy girl. Definitely looking forward to a return visit. Thanks for introducing me to this place Angie, and thank you to the accommodating staff for making us feel so welcome.

Tea Haus ," 8/26/2015 1 check-in Listed in 2015 Challenge: 100 done!, Yelp's happenin'? Three words: Basil Fried Chicken! A little on the salty side; however, a tad sweet too, moist, interesting, and for 5 bucks for a large cup it's a bargain to boot. An extra star for the tasty chicken! Next football game, I want 4 orders of this stuff (in lieu of wings; yeah, I mean it) and a cold beer (no alcoholic bevs here of course) = great combo!  Now onto the rest. Angie L's UYE! Yay! Gathered with a group of fellow Yeeps (= always a good time!), all of our first time visiting Tea Haus BTW, and were treated by the lovely, cool-ass Angie to some of TH's popular goodies.    Very inviting Zen like, modern interior with a cozy nook to sit or long tables at the back.  Fairly limited menu to choose from (which is great for a sometimes indecisive gal like myself): 6 signature bevs/coffees (including Boba Milk Tea, Sea Salt Crème Coffee, and regulars like lattes and such), and a few choices on handcrafted lemonades (Arnold Palmer anyone?). On our virgin voyage, I opted for an iced chamomile with boba (sadly I can't do caffeine) and the hubs had the Boba Milk - I loooove boba; however my husband is typically not all that interested, but he sucked his drink down faster than a Dyson picks up dust. So A+ for sure!  Three food items to nosh on: aforementioned Basil Fried Chicken, something called Affogato (ice cream something I think; didn't try), and these large squares of perfection called Brick Toast. Stacks of bread, covered with reduced condensed milk and lovely , fresh strawberry halves. Not overly sweet. Just right. Perfect balance of flavor and texture. Yum. Would be really great with a hot cup of coffee or tea.  Overall: One cool joint. Super friendly staff. Boba and fried chicken in one spot - I'm in it to win it. Great drinks, nom nom snacks, great locale, easy parking...yay, I'm a fan!  I'm also a fan of Angie! Thanks so much for the invite, introduction, ""info,"" and for picking up everybody's tab!!!

Tea Haus ," 9/20/2015 Updated review 18 check-ins Came back many MANY more times, and my love for Tea Haus is still as strong as the first time I experienced it.  They're getting more and more crowded, which makes me sad to have to wait in a line and talk over a greater volume of chatter, but super happy that they're doing well.  They won't be going anywhere for a while.  Over the last couple visits I've tried two more things on their ever-expanding menu.  Mint Mojito Iced Coffee Ooooh wow.  On a hot day, this is seriously refreshing.  You can see and feel the small leaves of mint flowing over your tongue and down your throat.  It's sweet and delicious.  Loving the great, yet not too powerful coffee flavor.  Will definitely add this into my rotation.  Affogato Delicious dessert, especially for the price!  Three generous scoops of ice cream, strong coffee flavor, and I love the powder (coffee or cocoa?) over the top.  I REALLY like this dessert.  And the quantity is definitely enough for two to share.  If I'm eating dinner on Anderson and feeling that sweet tooth afterwards, you can expect me to drive over to Tea Haus for some of this stuff.  Seriously, I've done this already.  Shout out again to their customer service.  Charlie was at the register today and remembered my name!  Mad props!  Or is it cause I come here too much? Spam musubi Affogato ", pos 
Tea Haus ," 8/17/2015 Updated review 41 check-ins ROTD 1/26/2016 Listed in Best Authentic (or as close as you can get) Asian foods, Bc Im so cool.. here are my RoTDs Its been only 5 months since I first discovered this place and this is easily my second home. Before I would always get the milk tea boba but asked for them to do it hot (not a lot of boba places will do it hot but it reminds me of the motherland). Als its the middle of Texas summer so that would be crazy right now. So lately I have tried their lemonades and regular cold milk tea bobas.  My favorite lemonade hands down is the blueberry mint. Its tart, sweet, and so freshing! It does take a few minutes to make so be patient, when its done it comes out the window by the kitchen in the back. As noted in my previous review, their milk tea is a perfect balance of tea and sweetness. They dont over sweetened their milk tea so it really brings the tea flavor out. I have had both the green tea and the black tea milk boba but since I am a boring person, I am more partial to the original black milk tea. The staff is always wonderful and lovely! My dog training is right nearby so on Wednesdays I bring my pup with me and she can hang out outside with the doggy water bowl while I run in to grab a drink. They are nice enough to bring it out to me everytime so that way I can chill outside with the dog.  When I am craving something sweet, the strawberry brick toast hits the spot. It has large halved strawberries on top of a giant sweet toast with condensed milk. Two people can share this massive thing easily. As for savory, they have their basil chicken which is delicious! The spices they use on it is so addicting!  Two things this places needs though, umbrellas for shade outside and a punch card!! Oooh! This was a nice little snack when i stopped in after work for drinks! Outside seating area. The shade is during the day, in the evening its sunny. My pup loves the water bowl outside! ", pos 
Tea Haus ," 4/21/2016 I'm always searching for a coffee shop with good vibes and a good setting.  Tea Haus definitely delivered!  Conveniently located in North Austin off of Anderson Lane, it gives us North Austin-ers a hip vibe minus the commute and traffic to get to some of the trendy central/South Austin coffee shops.  With beverage options ranging from Boba Tea, to Horchata, to one-of-a-kind coffee delights, there's something for everyone!  I opted for a Sea Salt Creme Coffee---YASSSSSSS. **Pats self on back.** It was delicious!  I also snagged a Spam Musubi --which is the only time I've ever seen one in Austin.  Being born and raise in Hawaii I think it's fair to say that I have good judgement over what is a legit musubi or not... let me tell y'all....this musubi GAVE ME LIFE!!!!! Very impressed with the quality and authentic taste.  Not to mention this is a great place to work and/or study.  The seating allows you to get comfy without going into full on slouch/slob mode (i.e. tons of couches).  I stayed in the shop working for 5 hours or so and received no side eyes or hurry-up-and-buy-something-else faces from the staff.  They gave me nothing but fabulous service and I'll definitely be back again soon! ", pos 
Tea Haus ," 7/25/2016 3 check-ins I come here because they have big, spacious tables which is rare in coffee shops, but it is a little dark and sometimes loud. I've been to this place many times, but after yesterday's experience, I decided I needed to write a review. My usual is the sea salt creme coffee, and this time, I decided to ask for less ice. The employee then told me that my drink would taste watery and I was like if you add less ice??? He then proceeded to tell me that they would put the same amount of drink, less ice, and fill the rest with water. ???!?!?!!!? I've been to other boba places before, and you can adjust the ice level freely, but I guess this just isn't one of those places. As for the other stuff, their mint blueberry lemonade is rly good, but the boba milk tea straight tastes like water and milk. my sea salt creme coffee with lots of ice ", neutral

Tea Haus ," 3/6/2016 5 check-ins FOOD:  Basil Fried Chicken: Ultra tender and is comparable to the fried chicken you get in the streets of Taiwan! It has a lot of flavor and the lime gives it an extra kick. It is extremely delicious. If you're here you have to order this!  Brick Toast: A thick piece of toast doused with condensed milk and topped with fresh strawberries. Super tasty, and a perfect amount of sweetness unlike desserts that are sickening sweet. It was a really good sized portion - plenty to fulfill your sweet cravings.  Spam Musubi: It's a snack sold everywhere in Hawaii and is similar to the traditional Japanese onigiri (rice ball). It has rice + spam + nori (dried seaweed) wrapped around it and is served warm. Sounds simple but it's really tasty! The portion size isn't big, but it's a good study bite.  DRINKS:  Sea Salt Creme Coffee: Try it both iced and hot. Really great coffee!  Boba Jasmine Milk Tea: I love how you can really taste the jasmine tea. It is creamy and the boba is high quality - soft and chewy goodness. Tea Haus is probably the best place in Austin (that I know of) to get boba milk tea. I always get it with half the sugar and find that it's still sufficiently sweet.  ATMOSPHERE: Music is great and is a perfect place to study or come to chat with friends.

Nice, clean space with everything you need for your drinks from honey to raw sugar to sugar alternatives.

Tea Haus , 2/15/2016 6 check-ins I used to love this place when they first opened. I constantly came and studied here and ordered my fair share of sea salt creme coffees. There is nothing bad about this coffee shop let me put that out there first.  The only thing I would like to note is that their drinks are extremely inconsistent. Particularly now that they have tons of fresh faces serving you coffee instead of the familiar ones when they first opened. So expect the drinks to taste different every time you come. I've received a SSCC that's extremely salty to one that doesn't even taste remotely close to what it's supposed to. They have a new menu! Now they're serving spam musubi!! , neutral 
Tea Haus ," 7/15/2015 5 check-ins Wow! What a cool little hidden gem tucked away next to Walmart! I didn't have too high of expectations for a tea place but I was blown away!  The mint mojito iced coffee was so great and exactly what I needed after a long day at work.  Also, the basil fried chicken is bite sized pieces of perfection! I couldn't stop eating them!  I also had the brick toast which was sweet on the outside, fluffy on the inside, and topped with fresh strawberries.  I loved it all.  There's also different types of lemonade, coffee, and, of course, tea! The staff were so friendly and my friend and I were offered coupons upon leaving.

I'm a business owner, and this place is a great place to think up new business ideas or collaborate with others, it's always super clean, which is great, and the music tends to be nostalgic and always at a reasonable volume, so I like that.  The staff is really friendly, the two guys are real chill, the girl with colored hair is always really nice, and there's another girl with colored eyes who's cute as a button and super nice, too.  Anytime you come here, you see lots of people hard at work on their macbooks, like medical students and law students, for example.  This place is located next to lots of good restaurants, so you could spend all day in this area, which is what I do frequently, and not have to drive anywhere for lunch or dinner.

While I only stopped in for a brief moment on a Sunday afternoon, it was enough to make me want to come back. Tea sounded great and I wanted a quick snack instead of a full meal. I got the basil fried chicken and was not disappointed. I love that Tea Haus gives you skewers to eat them with just like when you get fried chicken from a street vendor in Taiwan.  I can definitely see me making this a studying spot and I'll also be back for that brick toast. Sorry basil fried chicken, I may have an affair right in front of you.  Service was fast and the tea was good. They have a very small menu and that keeps things moving at a good pace.  If you're like me and you've seen this place on your quarterly trip to Walmart and have thought about going in, Doooooo eeeeeet! You won't be sad you took the chance. It happened...

Tea Haus ," 5/31/2015 2 check-ins I have been waiting to try Tea Haus for a while! I've been on a no-boba plan since coming from CA so let's get to business!  Location/inside: plenty of parking, multiple business and a Wal-mart neighboring. Industrial chic, clean, and positive vibes. Feels like ""7 Leaves Cafe"", my top Orange County boba place. Small, but nice area outside for dog lovers- nice gesture. Restroom was nice but no sinks inside. Two sinks are located in the hallway right outside the restroom.  Huge wooden counter lining the inner wall- packed with lots of stools. Really surprised. Several tables both in the back area for studying and the front. So spacious and studying friendly.  Service: Friendly, quick for drinks and food (drinks from counter and our food was ready for pick up in back area station)  Drinks: I've been to places with just 7 choices of boba and to others with crazy lots. We all ordered the Jasmine Milk tea which was highly recommended. Its nice and smooth. Really tasted as if freshly brewed. Balls- plump, and wonderful job on sweetness level.  ***Highlight of the day***  Basil Fried Chicken- Wow! Great job! Moistness was drooling and the coating/texture was irresistible.

Tea Haus ," 11/16/2015 Listed in Places to study in ATX/HTX This is easily my favorite drink place, and probably my most visited establishment of any kind in Austin these past few months. Despite living across the street from Tapioca House, I make the 15 minute drive here because Tap House tastes like sewer water while Tea Haus tastes like the Nectar of the Gods.  There are many great things about this place, of which I'll highlight the friendly staff, the magazine feature-worthy interior design, and the ever-so-Instagram/Snapchat-friendly mural. As expected, the drinks are the key selling point. There is a limited menu here (don't expect the endless wall of possibilities you'd see at Tap House or Coco's), but this is for good reason: everything they put out is constantly solid.  If you are a boba purist, Tea Haus is an absolute godsend. There's really only two kinds of traditional ""milk tea"" drinks here - a black milk tea and a jasmine milk tea - but they both knock it way out of the park.  Part of the reason for this is because Tea Haus has the best pearls in all of Austin - it's a special kind of honey boba that is the perfect texture (firm, but not ice cube-like) and just the right amount of sweet. I like to go half sweet on the drinks, as the honey boba provides a really nice sweet touch you don't often get from other boba places.  The Misugaru Latte - a barley-based coffee drink - is a recent addition to the featured items menu. It's tasty and has an addicting, grainy texture. I definitely expect it to become a fixture on the permanent menu.  Like for the drinks, the food menu is short but has good options. I really like the Basil Fried Chicken in particular - although a little salty (you can ask for less salt), it is tasty and won't make you hate yourself like KFC or Popeye's would. I don't consider the Brick Toast a great value (it's just toast, condensed milk, and strawberries), but it's a good thing to try at least once!  In short: Tea Haus is holding the boba fort down for the entire city of Austin, and I'm excited to visit here for my next study trip/hangout/Wal-Mart run/boba craving! ", pos 
Tea Haus ," 3/20/2016 Updated review 2 check-ins After several visits, I think 3 stars sums up this place. The atmosphere is still great, but nothing on their menu really stands out to me. I still think the snack selections are ok.  Their milk teas are watered down, and lack the tea flavor I'm looking for. The lemonades are interesting....I feel like the lemonade flavor overpowers the drinks overall and causes them to taste super sour.  Unfortunately my enthusiasm for this place declines with every visit. Tea Haus has yet to find its identity and produce something that's memorable. ", neutral

Tea Haus ," 5/2/2015 1 check-in I got three things off of their menu: basil chicken, milk tea with tapioca, and the brick toast.  Basil Chicken: AMAZING. Possibly the best take on Taiwanese fried chicken I've ever had in Texas. It tastes pretty close to the original flavor you would get in Taiwan and the portion is pretty decent.  Milk Tea with tapioca: The best thing about their milk tea is that you can actually taste the ""tea"" part of the drink. Many places use powdered milk tea and it just doesn't taste the same. Their tapioca is the right amount of chewiness and really delicious!  Brick toast: It looks super sweet, but it's actually not! The sourness of the strawberries offsets the condensed milk drizzle and powdered sugar. The toast is really soft and has a light milky aftertaste. It also doesn't hurt that this is super Insta-worthy. Milk tea + brick toast! ", pos 
Tea Haus ," 4/21/2015 12 check-ins I first heard about this place from my sister and brother-in-law. I can't quite remember, but either the owner(s) or co-workers are/were from ACTS, which is the church that my sister and brother-in-law go to. They were raving about this place, but honestly, I was very skeptical. Coming from Houston, which has a plethora of amazing bubble tea stores, I was highly disappointed with what Austin had to offer. I suppose I had too many bad experiences with the various bubble tea stores around Austin or maybe my expectations were too high. Either way, I judged Tea Haus too quickly.  Honestly, I don't know if I would call Tea Haus a bubble tea store. I mean, as of 4/21/15, they only have one bubble tea drink and that's the classic boba milk tea. All the other drinks consist of teas and various types of coffee. With that said, I believe Tea Haus has the best milk tea in Austin and for that sole reason, I've decided to give this place 5 stars.  The store itself is also very clean and well-kept. I've never studied here, but I've seen many people do so. It seems pretty conducive to studying considering the large number of seating available and how quiet the store is.  In terms of food, Tea Haus seems to be famous for its Brick Toast and Basil Fried Chicken. The Brick Toast is basically toast topped with strawberries and condensed milk. It's AMAZING! To be completely honest, I'm not a big fan of the Basil Fried Chicken. This is probably due to the fact that I'm not the biggest fan of fried food. My friends, however, seem to love it!  If you haven't stopped by this place, I would highly recommend coming by! I can totally see this place becoming a popular place for tourists in the mere future. Boba milk tea. Boba milk tea. ", pos

Tea Haus ," 7/16/2015 This place is a little confusing.  It's a tea shop.  A coffee shop.  A bubble tea shop.  IT'S ALL OF THEM.  Which I guess is good for friends with different tastes, but a little disappointing if you're looking for something in particular.  The bubble teas are not sealed and the cups are fairly thin and flexible, so the drinks consequently spill as soon you pick them up from the counter.  That quickly explained why the floor by the drink pickup counter was SUPER STICKY.  Icky sticky.  Bleh!  Lots of people hanging out with laptops, good amount of seating available.

Don't let its location at a strip mall fool you. The shop is very zen-like--I find their color scheme to be quite relaxing and a great place to catch up with a friend, or get some work done. There's also plenty of natural lighting in this shop making it a cheerful place to visit.  They have wifi but it wasn't working the day I was there *womp womp*. Luckily, I was still able to catch Which Wich's wifi signal close by.  Food: It's easy to make a decision on what to order as they have about 3-4 items to choose from from the drinks menu and about the same on the food menu as well.  Having lived in Taiwan and being Taiwanese, I'd say their milk tea with boba hit the spot. The tapioca pearls were fresh and not hard. If you don't like having too much sugar in your drinks, be sure to tell the ""barista"" you'd like to have 1/4 of the standard sugar they add. I would be happy to replace my daily cup of coffee with Tea Haus' milk tea any day. Also, looking forward to trying out their famed brick toast and basil chicken, mmm.

Tea Haus ," 3/21/2015 5 check-ins They do serve other items besides tea. I know the name would be misleading but at first when I heard about Tea Haus I thought it was a boba place. But then I realize there was only one item and it's just the usual Boba Milk Tea - made with black tea and cream. But then I notice they have other coffee drinks and a little bit more tea drinks. I know I should be drinking more tea because it's healthier but I'm more of a coffee lover.  Looking at the menu, they serve affrogato (espresso with ice cream) which makes them the second place that serves affrogato. The first place which serves them is Dolce Neve. Then I have tried their basil fried chicken which was tasty. They welcome suggestions and I mention maybe adding some aioli or rice with the basil fried chicken. If don't want any coffee or tea, they do serve a green juice blend or a mint blueberry lemonade. I have tried the latter which is really fresh and a great alternative to their coffee and tea.  They have a set of armchairs in the front and some small tables in the front. When the late afternoon sun come, you may want to go to the back where it's a bit darker. The back has several long tables and 4-5 small tables.  Other items I need to try are obviously their teas, sea salted creme coffee and their simple green juice. I did speak to one of the employees who mentioned they are going to add more items to the menu soon. That would be another reason to come back and see what more treats they have in store.

Tea Haus ," 5/1/2015 2 check-ins I have been searching for a sweet little coffee/ tea/ trendy/ hip hangout cafe since I've moved here. Randomly came here on a Saturday since I was in the area. I am so happy that I decided to check this place out!! The ambiance was full of college students studying which took up most of the tables (reminded me of the old days). However, there was still enough seats to go around the long tables in the back. The menu although limited on the selection of food & drinks, had some pretty solid choices. I had the the grapefruit honey green tea & the basil fried chicken nuggets! Delicious! The drink was made just right (not too sweet, just enough). The chicken was juicy and very flavorful. There were about 6-7 pieces in the order .... Probably best to share that.  In all this place is great! TH reminds me of a crossover of philz (in SF) and a taiwanese bbt shop. Will definitely come back again! Hopefully next time they will have more food options! Grapefruit honey green tea ", pos

Tea Haus ," 3/31/2015 11 check-ins Sometimes, simple is better. That's what separates Tea Haus from all the other boba chains in Austin. No fancy menu with bazillion flavor options. Clean and simple. Nice!  For our first visit, we tried their Boba Milk Tea, Grapefruit Honey Green Tea, and the Brick Toast. I would seriously come back over and over again for their honey green tea! The brick toast was great but in the end, it's still just a giant piece of toast with condense milk poured over it. Not worth $6. Cool place to hangout overall and we would certainly come back to try out the other items on their simple menu. brick toast ", pos

The first time I came, one of the workers took the time to explain everything to me step by step asking for my preferences and giving me suggestions about what I might like. And the second time I came, he actually remembered me, even though it was days later.  I always order their brick toast and the sea salt creme coffee. I actually don't like sweet coffee, and actually take my coffee black, but this coffee makes me want to get up in the morning (And if you know me, that means a lot, cuz I am NOT a morning person). According to the worker, a lot of people order the coffee cold, but I prefer my drinks warm especially when drinking it with toast. I think these two complement each other well, and it's definitely a place I will return to if I am ever craving sweet coffee and some quiet time to myself or with friends. Take my word for it, and come try their food. It will not disappoint you! Brick toast ", pos

I also got to try their basil fried chicken today, and it is amazing. These fried chicken bites actually taste like the street food in Taiwan - hot, fresh, with a flavorful fry (squeeze the lime on top: lime + basil combination is a winner), and juicy, tender, melt-in-your-mouth white meat chicken. The chicken itself is still delicious and not overpowered by the flavor of the fry. Love it.  And as usual, customer service is on point. + It's also a great place to study since the tables are so large and there's a lot of open space and high ceilings. basil fried chicken & boba milk teas & plant basil fried chicken - amazing boba milk teas & a blueberry mint lemonade ", pos 
Tea Haus ," 9/6/2015 1 check-in Listed in Boba-palooza As if the German-esque name didn't suggest it, Tea Haus is possibly one of the most hipster and trendy tea shops I have been, making this a cool place to study and hang out. Sadly despite its name, the tea was not unfortunately up to expectation.  Boasting organic choices, Tea Haus's menu is limited compared to the usually big selections at typical boba places to focus on quality over quantity. As a huge boba, my first instinct was to order the classic tapioca milk tea ($3.15 with tax for regular 20 oz) and at first taste, it was delicious! The boba was also fresh too judging from its texture and has a light honey undertone, but the amount of boba in a cup was rather small. After finishing the tea, I also became more thirsty afterwards - not a good sign since it is usually an indication of too much creamer powder.  However, just when I was disappointed with the tea, the basil chicken brought this place back to me! Other places, either in America or Taiwan, sell fried basil chicken in small meat chunks that are often dry, but Tea Haus's basil chicken was huge in juicy chunks. Along with the classic Taiwanese fried chicken seasoning, the basil made the lightly battered chicken even more irresistible. For $5.95, you can get a nice portion of perhaps one of the best Taiwanese fried chicken in America and Taiwan I had.  Overall, although the milk tea was rather disappointing, the basil chicken was enough to make me revisit again. Because there are so many tables in here that finding a seat is usually not a problem even with a huge crowd, I can't wait for the next time I return to work or meet up friends over the stellar basil chicken.  --- tl;dr version: 1) Hipster and trendy tea shop perfect for work and hangout 2) Disappointing boba milk tea 3) Phenomenal basil-enhanced Taiwanese fried chicken ", pos 
Tea Haus ," 8/27/2015 1 check-in This is seriously my favorite bubble tea in Austin.  The boba tastes fresh, the tea tastes divine, and the service is awesome. It's clean and pretty on the inside if you're coming on a date or have friends who are picky about ambiance. Also - If you haven't tried the fried chicken here - do it. You won't regret it! Personally, I wasn't a huge fan of the toast (it was a thick piece of bread with condensed milk and admittedly delicious strawberries), but many of my friends loved it, so I think it depends on your taste.  I'd say the only true downside for me here is that they don't have sugar substitutes. As a diabetic type 1, I usually just end up getting my tea without any sweetener. This is fine - but a few more options for sweetness issues would make it top notch, for me.  Also, if you're with someone who likes a lot of choices with bubble tea flavors, the selection here is limited but solid. Definitely a different feel than Cocos or Teapioca. ", pos

Tea Haus ," 6/18/2016 Been dreaming about that melt-in-your-mouth basil fried chicken...and I've never been to Tea Haus until today.  I got the succulent basil fried chicken (about 10 pieces, 1/2 lb) seasoned with their magic spices and basil leaves, along with a small piece of lime. The chicken was scalding hot when I first bit into it and exploded with juiciness and flavor. BUT in hindsight, I wish they gave me more than a tiny slice of lime that only had enough juice to spread over like 2 pieces of chicken. I bet there'd be even more flavor if I had more lime. Oh, and I also got the mint-blueberry lemonade. I was looking for something sour and sweet to balance out the saltiness of the fried chicken. Refreshing and tangy lemonade!  I will definitely be back next time to try some of their other lemonades and the milk tea! ", pos

The fun thing about Tea Haus is figuring out what they're trying to be: A trendster coffeehouse with Boba tea? A chic industrial-tech juice bar with Basil Fried Chicken? I think I'm a fan just because they're cool.  It's in soft opening, they're still tweaking, and I'm not even sure what their current hours are. But the staff is wonderful, they're excited about being here, and everything else will work itself out. When Yvonne the manager asked how my straight black Summermoon drip was, I said it was a tad weak for me, and we started talking about Austin's coffee roasters while doing espresso & matcha shots. And those were great. Incidentally, if you need a carb rush, try their Brick Toast.  It occurs to me this section of Anderson Lane between Burnet & MoPac has just about everything you need in life, and all highly regarded by Yelpers who come around here. Movies, restaurants, bars, acupuncture, Petticoat Fair, and apparently one cool dentist. Tea Haus is the newest kid on the block, and in perfect company. Very Zen. Oh, if you look closely, ""Dave"" is the name I use whenever I order Boba Milk Tea. It's just easier all around at different places. Okay, sometimes I take pics of my coffee cup.

If you want to be productive, come around late afternoon/early evening, because around 8:30 pm hordes of people started flooding in and taking turns posing by the cool artsy poem snippet shindig on the wall.  For drinks, I got the grapefruit green tea. This drink featured a deliciously fragrant green tea (I really loved it) with grapefruit syrup and a bit of fruit pulp. I would have preferred more natural flavors and more pulp--perhaps a splash of grapefruit juice--but the overall concoction was very refreshing. My boyfriend's jasmine milk tea boba was not sweet at all, surprisingly--lots of jasmine flavor and less cream. And this was a regular sweet level, so I wonder what half sweet tastes like.

I'm usually not a fan of it and I will drink it only if it is offered, but that doesn't apply here. The milk tea has the perfect level of sweetness and there was just the right amount of boba. I tried some of my friend's sea salt creme coffee and he said it was like Starbucks's white mocha. But better. I don't know how Starbucks's white mocha tastes, but regardless, this drink was yummy.  The basil fried chicken was awesome. Literally the best I've had. It was enough to share with a friend and I loved the presentation of it. The flavors meshed really well together; not too spicy and just the right amount of crunch.  The interior is perfect for a casual date or study sesh.

This drink helped curb that craving! I highly recommend the lemonades if you're trying this place out for the first time.  Mint mojito iced coffee - I had to ask them to remake it with half the sugar because it was way too sweet as is. The staff is very accommodating and instantly made me another one :) If you like a lot of cream in your coffee, then go for this one. I personally didn't care for the coated layer on the roof of my mouth after a few sips.

This is kind of weird, but I like there bathroom situation. There is only one co-ed bathroom, and what I like is that they have the sinks outside. This is smart because if there was a line, it makes it go faster. Also, I think that having the sinks outside encourages hand-washing because people can see you (for all the gross people out there who don't wash their hands lol)  The staff are always so friendly and helpful. I am super indecisive and take forever to decide what I finally want, and they really helped me pick what to get without rushing me. Shout out to Natasha for being amazing and so genuine. She really helped make the best decision ever to get the sea salt cream coffee. That stuff is dangerous. Pretty sure I down that drink way too fast. Also, the milk tea is pretty bomb, and the bobas/bubbles in it have a really good consistency and texture. The grapefruit green tea was okay. I think I should try it again with less sweetener, so I don't want to set my judgement on it just yet. The basil chicken is so worth it guys. I got it after being full from eating hopdoddys across the street, and it was still amazing. The subtle basil flavor is perfect, and I like how it's a lot of meat and not just thick pieces of batter. Speaking of meat, the chicken is not dry, but is super tender/juicy.  Definitely want to come back and try out the other drinks and food, especially the brick toast.  [update]  Okay guys I literally came back in less than 24 hours lol the brick toast is so yummy! The bread is lightly toasted to create a slight crunch on the outside, and the inside is like soft, fluffy clouds. The strawberries are fresh and taste so good with the bread. I like how the toast isn't overly sweet. It's a perfect, delicately sweetened snack...Actually it's pretty big so make sure you're hungry or share it with a friend(: ", pos

I tried a jasmine milk tea and it was just sweet enough and very floral. It tastes like real honey was added, which really is refreshing from bubble tea that uses just a ton of sugar. The boba menu isn't that huge though, but from what I tried at least, wouldn't get anything else. The pearls are perfectly pleasantly chewy too. ", pos

Tea Haus ," 9/21/2015 1 check-in I have been here a few times since it opened and have been pleased. Usually when I go to a boba place, I get a flavored tea (like a blueberry green or strawberry green) with some jellies or tapioca and call it a day. This was different as they specialize in milk tea. I figured, why not, good to try new things. I must say, it was pretty awesome.  While this isn't the type of place you'd come to for a meal, you can get snacks in the form of the basil fried chicken and brick toast. So if you plan on studying or coding for a few hours, this is a great place. Wi-Fi is fast and there is decent seating. There are only about 4 individual tables, a bar, and two community tables.

I saw a lot of cute Instagram photos and good reviews about the ambience here, but when I went, it didn't live up to my expectations at all. The outdoor seating felt like a dirty backyard. There were cigarette butts everywhere - even in the bus bin where I returned my cup.

I couldn't even spot the teepee everyone so lovingly speaks of.  Beyond that disappointment, this place is pretty nice. There is a lot of seating outdoors, so I can see how it would be a good place to enjoy the company of some friends. There are treats from Quacks, always a plus, and the coffee is pretty good.

First off, there's quirky groceries from Brooklyn and other-such hip places. Think: artisinal jams/sauces, and a few other options. They'll cost a bit, but you won't be able to find the things that they have anywhere else in town. The same seems to go for the clothes, which are very stylish, but also expensive and less common around town. Really, everything is trendy and stylish, and the space itself is just cute.  Outside they have a tepee that's pretty artistic, and a few bright, metallic pinatas. They serve fancy coffee, a few decent wines, and mimosas. If you'd like a pastry, they can do that as well.

Delicious coffee, hidden away, no crowds. ", pos 
Friends & Neighbors ," 8/26/2015 One of my favorite places to have a cup of joe and relax with my dog!!! I love the teepee and the owner and barista are the shit!!! I bring all my friends, local and foreign here on a regular basis and they never let me down!!!! ", pos 
Friends & Neighbors ," 9/24/2014 7 check-ins Austinites have shown, time and time again, that they love a good hole-in-the-wall. The less people know about it, the better. Friends & Neighbors, being basically brand new, is definitely the definition of a hole-in-the-wall but there is no way that a place like this can remain a secret for that much longer.  It is a little confusing at first. When you drive down Cesar Chavez, you are apt to see a bunch of businesses all with vague names and looking like houses. You tell yourself that you want to see what they are, but then you forget. Friends & Neighbors is a house (look for the green and pink arrows pointing at it) featuring a clothing store in the front and a coffeehouse in the back. The backyard area has four big pecan trees for shade, and the owners there do everything in their power to keep the mosquitoes off of you.    The owners are the same people who own Hillside Pharmacy, and they have a taste for nice things. Stumptown Coffee highlights the menu, as well as a rotating selection of organic pastries. They also make a mean lemonade as well as an Italian cream soda.  My favorite flavor combination? Strawberry and peach.  One cannot help wonder if they might be better suited with doing away with the clothing section, and converting that part of the quaint house into indoor seating. Look into any coffeehouse in Austin and what will you find? Hipsters typing on their Macs. I feel like this place would truly excel with indoor seating, especially in the winter when people are not going to want to sit outside, but will still want hot coffee.  Also, any place that hosts both a puppet show or a Mariokart N64 tournament is automatically awesome. ", pos 
Friends & Neighbors , 2/26/2016 Walked in and really enjoyed the cokespresso. I'm not sure why I've never had this. We had just gotten in from our flight and things still seemed to be starting up in Austin. Not exactly a central location but if you're in the area it's certainly worth checking out. The breakfast tacos they serve also do quite the job for an early morning snack. , pos 
Friends & Neighbors ," 5/17/2015 Amazing amazing!! Inspiring! What's with Austin and their amazing cafes?? Vancouver needs to get on this approachable, homey cafe vibe. This place is incredible. Not a commercial space but an old house converted to feature a home tastefully decorated and filled with local, artisan, and a selection of vintage goods, art zines and local photography on the walls.. pretty much my favourite kind of space. The bar is, fittingly, in the kitchen, our barista was hilarious, and we came by on the perfect day to sit outside at one of the shaded picnic tables and take our time enjoying the experience. Try the cokespresso. Follow their instagram & go to their events so I can live vicariously through you. Love spots with such a focus on community. Woo! ", pos 
Friends & Neighbors ," 4/24/2015 This place is wonderful and special. If you need to get out of the house, but don't want your typical coffee shop, are craving a bite to eat (but not a full meal), a bit of art, this place fits that bill. The manager was really nice. He said hello to my dog and brought him a treat! He makes all the shrub drinks that are FANTASTIC and will mix it with cava for a sparkling delight. The pork rillette was rich and satisfying. I will be back! ", pos

Check out the teepee, sit in the shady backyard or on the porch! Chat with the staff!  It's a retail store and cafe in an old house, and it feels like somewhere you'd want to (and be allowed to) hang out for days. ", pos 
Friends & Neighbors ," 9/24/2014 I was really excited about coming here, because it looked so cute and unique. The teepee was a nice touch but it would be nice if they made it useable...maybe with some pillows or blankets so you're not sitting on dirt. My friend and my lattes were luke warm...I prefer my coffee hot I guess. There was not a lot of snack choices either. The seating area was cute enough but could have been more comfortable. With some work this place could be real nice. ", neutral 
Friends & Neighbors , 9/24/2014 This is a really lovely place.  Good outdoor area and surprisingly easy parking situation (you can exit out the back and not onto cesar chavez.  Wish they had a discount price for iced coffee refills but that's a small complaint.  Highly recommended. , pos 
Sorrento’s Coffee ," 10/7/2016 I'm trying not to make coming here an everyday habit, but this place is making it really difficult! It's right across the street from my work so I end up here a couple times a week. The BEST lattes. They have a wide variety of unique drinks and flavors.

Pros: friendly staff plenty of variety Offers food Drive thru available Affordable coffee & treats  Cons: Coffee isn't spectacular (personal opinion) ONLY drive thru, so if you're looking to sit down in a cafe, save this stop for ""to-go"" trips ", pos 
Sorrento’s Coffee ," 10/17/2016 I live next door to Sorrento's and it is really hard not to come every day. I think they use real cream in their blended drinks and they are SO so So good. They sell THE BEST kolaches (Kolache Creations), and their breakfast tacos are TacoDeli. See why I can't go every day?  I normally get the iced toddy, sometimes it's delicious and perfect, and sometimes it tastes like regular iced coffee (cold but burnt). Regardless, it's usually better than the green monster down the street. The only other thing is that I wish they would consider using different beans though, because whatever they use is a little sour when you don't get it with cream! ", pos 
Sorrento’s Coffee ," 6/13/2016 1 check-in This place is exactly what I need. I don't want to drink shite Starbuck's coffee, but with two babies I must have a drive thru.  So, here is Sorrento's, I've driven by it 574 times and finally stopped. The coffee was good, the barista offered a rewards deal which is awesome, asked if I wanted animal crackers for my toddler, and had dog bones for my dog.  When I'm on my own this is the place I'll be stopping for coffee. They had a pretty extensive drink menu that I'll certainly be checking out as time goes on. ", pos

Sorrento’s Coffee ," 6/9/2016 Updated review I had a little extra time before work to stop by and snag a coffee so I decided to give Sorrento's another shot. Again, the ladies there were super nice and this time I was blessed by the coffee gods and was behind only one car *PRAISE THEE COFFEE GODS*  Unfortunately, so far it's been 2/3 lattes I've ordered that have tasted burned and not at all like the flavoring I requested. Their special today was a combo of the toasted marshmallow and almond, sounds delish, right? I'm sipping it now and it just tastes like a slightly sweetened burned latte.  Sigh.  I was hoping to like this place, thinking maybe it was a fluke last time. Two out of three is enough for me to perhaps look elsewhere for my coffee. ", neutral

Sorrento’s Coffee ," 5/24/2016 1 check-in Stopped in here the other day while the family was out and about. Oh dear. In a few words....  Delicious, friendly, handmade, LOCAL. We all ended up loving this place.  They serve Ruta Maya coffee (which is my favorite), so I was especially happy about that. They make banana bread (omg it is SO incredibly delicious). Zucchini bread, cookies (the chocolate chip is amazing), breakfast sandwiches/croissants, they also serve Taco deli tacos.   Everyone was extremely friendly and the food they bake is mouthwatering.  We ordered 2 coffees, 1 hot chocolate, 2 chocolate chip cookies, 1 Banana bread.  The bread is incredible.  We wanted a loaf, but by the time we went back, they were closed.  That's ok.  We will be back.  Great location for us, too.  Not too far out of the way.  Prices are extremely modest for so many organic, local, and handmade items.  Love this little joint! ", pos 
Sorrento’s Coffee ," 9/16/2015 1 check-in I'm not much of a coffee drinker, but if I was I could see myself coming here pretty often. It's a little shack in the middle of a parking lot. Park and walk up to the window or use the drive-thru. Cute.  There was only one person working there when I went on a Sunday morning, so it can take a few minutes to get your order. But when I took my first sip of my iced chai latte, I was like ""dayum, that's good"". It was so delicious and flavorful, with just the right amount of sweet and spice. I'm smitten.  They have a good selection of drinks and a ton of flavored syrups if you're into that. They also have food: a variety of pastries and a few TacoDeli tacos. I haven't tried any from here but if I wanted to spoil myself with some breakfast on the go, I now know to come back. ", pos

A helpful tip: if there is a long line for the drive thru, I would recommend ordering at the window. Service is much faster that way. They also serve breakfast tacos from Casa Chapala, and other muffins and pastries. Also, they have a membership and if you sign up you receive your 10th drink free. You just need to let them know when you order your drink that you are a member so they can notate your membership in their system. If you're in the area and would like a quick pick me up on the go, this is your ideal place! ", pos

I started frequenting this shop when I moved from south Austin to north central Austin, and decided to expand my horizons. The lattes are amazing and I love how easy and non-intimidating their menu is. Although I do feel the customer service has varied over the years, I am pleased with how quickly this shop can knock out those orders. I tend to only swing by on my late mornings, as I sometimes open up shop before the sunrise and have been told that they get their breakfast tacos in a little later than I was hoping for. This girl doesn't wait around for her tacos. That being said, if you are looking for a quality cup of coffee with some Austin charm that still holds true to the easy menu of a chain coffee house, Sorrento's has it all. ", pos

It also has a walk up option but I usually just get in the car line. It's never too long of a wait. I usually get green tea and honey with one of their muffin-whiches (sausage or bacon) and it's pretty good. I definitely recommend going here! , pos

It is REALLY strong so when they asked me ""would you like milk and sugar"" I said yes and I didn't regret it.  The thing that is interesting about this coffee, though is the fact that it is so strong yet not bitter for what it is!  The flavor is a bit acidic but quite pleasant.  It definitely has less of the ""nutty"" flavor but I really enjoyed it.  My wife tried the hot chocolate steamer with toasted marshmallow syrup and it was just ok.  The chocolate flavor was very minimal but we just figured it must be due to the ""steamer"" part of it all so... so be it!  If you like a strong cup of iced coffee with barely any bitterness then try the iced toddy!  *thumbs up Iced Toddy with cream and sugar / hot chocolate with toasted marshmallow syrup ", pos

Sorrento’s Coffee ," 9/12/2014 First time here...walk up order...seemed like an interesting place, fits into where I would frequent.   This review will be two parts: experience and coffee. Experience:  Two people working inside.  Ordered a Venti iced latte with, the board said cinnamon roll was the flavor of the day, cinnamon roll flavor.  I was told $6, which confused me because my drink was only around $4.  He confused my drink for a base iced latte and a cinnamon roll.  I was going to correct him, but he seemed pissed off.  Like his day was horrible, and didn't want to deal with me.  I stuck with what he gave me.  Coffee:  The latte was awesome, the cinnamon roll was awesome.  Price was very reasonable.    I would come back here often, but I won't drive out of the way due to my experience.  Ordering coffee is stressful enough to me with all the options, especially at a new place.  A welcoming smile makes it easier. ", neutral 
Sorrento’s Coffee ," 1/5/2015 Americano (coffee w shot of espresso) was pretty good. Well rounded, not too acidic. Had a shot of chocolate added.  Cappuccino- as I was handed it, barista said ""sorry, its on the wet side, is that okay?"" When he explained that means it has little foam, I said that it is fine. However, the issue is it tasted like watery milk with a hint of after taste coffee. Would not have even called it a coffee beverage.  Probably wont return.

I ordered a double shot cappuccino with soy milk--they have so many non-dairy alternatives (soy/almond/coconut) for people with dairy allergies/intolerances.  My drink is actually very tasty and delicious. The coffee is well-rounded and the price wasn't too bad either. It actually tastes like coffee (robust and strong), and I STRONGLY recommend this cute little local shop.

Sorrento’s Coffee ," 12/7/2013 My only regret in writing this review is that I can't give them more stars. This quaint little coffeeshop is the absolute epitome of what a coffeeshop should be, in my humble opinion.  First of all, nothing is worse than a crabby barista when you are sleep and caffeine deprived. I have NEVER had that problem here. There are three girls that I see throughout my work week that are the sweetest, most competent little lovelies ever. They remember my name, and never show any exasperation when I ask for my ten to twenty word coffee-drink, even if they have a line of cars behind me. Having worked as a barista for Starbucks when I was in college, I know how frustrating people like me can be when you are busy! There is nothing better with coffee in the early hours than a genuine smile. Thanks ladies.  Secondly, this lil gem has basically every dairy alternative a lactose-intolerant could hope for. Once, they had run out of almond milk, so I tried coconut milk for the first time and was blown away. Their variety of flavors and products are superb and their pastries and tacos are fresh and seriously, you can taste that they are made with love.  Overall, this is my absolute favorite coffee spot in Austin, even if their little cottage  isn't quite big enough yet for me to squeeze into with my work laptop. :)  Keep up the great work!  Also their coffee club is great! You just give them your name and they give you a free coffee every ten cups of joe! ", pos

I had a few friends from Houston come visit and we were just cruising down Anderson when suddenly we had the urge for caffeine.  Pulled up my trusty yelp app on the iPhone and was able to locate this nice little spot. Emphasis on little as it looks like a tiny house.  In any case, we pulled up and were greeting by a bird seed feeder turned tip jar guarded by a plastic army toy and your personal sense of honor and integrity.  Waited a few moments before we were greeted and were given great suggestions. I ignored them all when I saw the red bull italian soda.  Got it in Green Apple and was very happy. Everyone else ordered other stuff but everyone else also wanted to sip my drink...  Yeah. Life was good after that day. ", pos

Sorrento's shack-sized establishment offers walk-up service, but it's the drive thru that most everyone uses. Quick, friendly service awaits - this is one location that radiates that special blend of Austin charm.  But their coffee is anything but weird - it's tasty, affordable, and available in a ridiculous number of styles. I'm a traditionalist, so it's usually an au lait or a latte for me. Rare is the day that I can resist the call of the Gigante-sized cup: It's twice as much coffee as you'd get for the same price in a national chain.  Feeling peckish? There's a ton of food available here, too. A working morning will see me picking up a taco or some biscotti. On a weekend, I'll splurge on a blueberry muffin.  Sorrento's is convenient, affordable, and delicious. Shop local, play hard, love one another, drink coffee. ", pos

She also knew how to make a mocha correctly, which sadly is not a skill that a lot of people who live outside the Northwest, (where I am from) actually know. I am usually really disappointed with coffee drinks, but I was very pleasantly surprised here. Both iced mochas were really good, and not knock-your-socks-off strong for double shots, but had great coffee flavor. I would definitely go here again. Thanks! ", pos

Sorrento’s Coffee ," 1/2/2013 2 check-ins I think this is where people go when the Starbucks drive-through line is too long. I've only been there once (had a kid in the car so I did drive through, which is pretty much against my religion normally). I'd have to say the iced coffee was top notch and they have breakfast tacos from Casa Chapala, which seems to have a near-monopoly on local breakfast tacos now that Elsi's is closed (they are good, I'm not complaining).  There was no wait, and the barrista was nice and fast. I'd stop again. They do have the same issue as old BC Coffee had--being on the wrong side of the road for people heading downtown. But I managed to get in and out pretty easily.  I'll try 'em again to get a better idea what's what, but so far so good. Not sure if it's a chain or just this one either. ", pos

Sorrento’s Coffee ," 2/1/2013 Gah, I love Sorrento's! Reasons:  1.) It's a drive-thru, I don't think any other local places have that going for them.  2.) Amazing customer service. I tried a new drink  this morning and the guy told me to taste it before driving off. That way, if I didn't like it he could modify it or re-make it for me. Who does that? The people here! They are so great about making sure you love what you're getting  3.) Great coffee! The plain coffee is delicious but they have all of these flavors you can try out too. Such as a toasted marshmallow latte or a buttered rum hot chocolate. Ask the barrista what he/she recommends and you'll get something fun and different for sure.  4.) Easy rewards program. I have no idea how many coffees you have to buy before you get a free one because I'm there all the dang time but you can earn free coffees. Yum!  5.) Good non-caffeinated drinks for the kiddos. They have frozen lemonades, italian sodas, smoothies and milkshakes for your kids (or yourself).  Just go and try it yourself! You'll totally love it. ", pos 
Sorrento’s Coffee , 12/5/2013 I honestly want to move up North just so I can be near this place. It's near my girlfriends house and I go out of the way to go there in the morning when I stay there. Their medium ice coffee is gigantic and only $2.50 and they don't fill it up with giant ice so it's actually only two sips. It's a lot of coffee which is what I need in the morning. And it's delicious. And they have a lot of options. And it's a Drive Thru. And the girls that work there are super awesome and tolerate my dumb jokes about how tired I am. And they take your name every time you go so you can get free coffee. No punch cards that I would always forget to bring. And there's barely ever a line which is amazing but kind of scares me cause if they go out of business I will die. GO HERE ALL THE TIME. ITS THE BEST. Gigantic medium ice coffee.

We drove up, I ordered my mocha and from the moment I took my first sip... I knew these guys knew what they were doing. It was the most absolutely perfect cup. Sweet, but not too sweet to overpower the espresso. I felt the coffee course through my veins and bring a big ol' smile to my face. Pure heavenly bliss.

Needing a caffeine boost and a snack recently, I stopped by for a visit.  Sorrento's is locally owned with quick service, which is worth its weight in gold for those of us on the go. They not only have coffee, but they serve breakfast tacos and goodies from Russell's bakery. Their lattes are delicious. And if that's not enough, they're nice too.

I'm sorry I never posted here before, since their coffee is great (so much better than Starbucks' burned java) and, as a local owner, they need our business.  It's hard to compete against the big boxes.  This place is just as good as my downtown fave, the Bike Caffe in the plaza at 9th and Congress in front of the big office building.  Oh, and they also have good breakfast tacos, although I don't usually get those.  I like their iced coffee and pastries (used to be from Russel's, guess they still are).

I take a quick detour through the neighborhood to an honest-to-god independently owned coffee house that saves my butt.  Sometimes the drip isn't as strong as I would like, but I learned that I can ask for the ""bold drip"" and get french roast or something similar. They add however many sweetners and a touch of creamer that I like and I'm on my way, usually in less than 5 minutes, waiting time and all.

After spontaneously deciding I needed to give myself some nice, warm delicious caffeine juice, I pulled up to the little drive-thru house.  The set-up is pretty straightforward. Pull up to the window, select your drink, pay your cash, leave a tip in the tip jar, drive away and get to drinking.  I ordered a Grande Latte, with little sugar. I'm not huge on sweet coffees, but I feel the sugar can round out some of the flavor at times. The latte was great, I was surprised how big the cup was for $2.65 (the girl said it was happy hour at 1pm?). I'd say on regular hours, you'd probably be paying the same, if not a tiny bit less, than you would at starbucks, but for 2.65? Hellz yeah.

If you want a more...European/Italian style coffee, go to a sit down place like San Francisco Bakery across the street. ", pos

Sorrento’s Coffee ," 10/24/2011 Listed in COFFEE... Best caramel macchiato I've had, no doubt.    This cute little drive/walk up was being operated by a very friendly lady that made our coffee, made some chit chat, and cashed us out.  Yes, there is a little bit of a wait because of one or two people in the hut doing all the work, but the wait was definitely worth it.  If you have a Keurig machine at home, I don't recommend you go here and order regular coffee, unless you like Tully's blend and just want someone else to make it for you.  There's nothing wrong with Tully's, but we have a Keurig at home so we wouldn't pay someone else to make a cup we can make for ourselves (also we'd probably have a Green Mountain blend instead).  But, the other drinks are very delish.  We imagined this place being started by an entrepreneur with dreams of owning/running a standing coffee house (instead of a hut) one day.  Hope that's true, but even if it's not, we support this little coffee hut with the surprisingly good coffee.  We can't wait to go up north again for a cuppa from this place. ", pos

First off, this place kicks Starbucks' A, S, S. I work in the area and I have to say, their coffee is so much more satisfying in taste. (Trust me. I'm a hardcore coffee drinker. My caffeinated hands are literally sh..sh..shaking when I'm typing this.) Plus, they don't do that little half cup full of foam trick to your latte like some shady big franchise does (*cough).  The wait is never long and the staff is always friendly. Gotta love their happy hour too! WHAT? You heard it right!  I mean, does Starbucks remember your name and what your usual drink is?

I can't even remember if I showered or what I had for breakfast some mornings, but somehow, they remember what I like. So tip your baristas for that reason alone especially given the amount of traffic that rolls through.  They also offer a member card that grants you a free drink for every nine purchased.

Flavor wise, nothing stuck out, but I'd love to try the other drinks. They get their beans from Fara Coffee, a local roaster with beans originating from Nicaragua.  In addition, there's lenty of seating for you to enjoy your drink, and Elixer provides an easy option for caffeine as you wait for your order from the other trucks: FOtT, Bud's, etc.  Overall, Elixer offers strong drinks with fantastic service.

Elixer serves up Austin's own Fara Coffee. And it's delicious! 2. Adam. Adam is hands down the friendliest, most genuine barista in town. Maybe it's his Midwestern/Wisconsin charm.

MMmmmmm.. + Iced hazelnut/vanilla latte. + Americano. For when I want something slightly more potent than drip coffee, which is also good here btw!

There is nothing I like better than trundling up to the counter on those cold cloudy days when I've run out of beans at home.  Other than a simply great location, this coffee is caf-FINE! Dark, rich and strong, I actually needed a tiny bit of cream to bite this one. The barrista seemed genuinely happy to serve me and chat while he put together my order, and I got to watch the pink sunrise over the park. Other bonuses include reasonable prices and tax included in the menu. ($2 for a simple cup of drip coffee.) ", pos 
Elixer Coffee , 5/18/2010 First to Review Listed in It's a 4 or 5 star Trailer food! Elixer Coffee is one of the most original and awesome ideas in the ever growing trailer park food stand places! Roscoe is the name of the 1952 Studebaker truck that is fully outfitted in the bed to serve numerous types of organic espresso drinks and teas.  I decided on the cold brewed iced coffee with organic whole milk and it was just about perfect - I prefer my brew stronger but that could have been my fault for adding too much milk. When asked how it was I mentioned that and Keturah (the proprietor) offered to add more Coffee which made it much better. The other creamer options are organic half and half and nonfat milk. My only suggestion would be invest in Stevia or at least Splenda instead of Sweet N Low for people who can not take sugar.  Bonus points for offering my dogs a bowl of water!!!  They are currently located in the new Trailer Park at 801 Barton Springs Rd just East of Lamar. dog friendly cold brewed iced coffee See all photos from Tara M. for Elixer Coffee , pos 
Elixer Coffee ," 1/1/2012 1 check-in I had a quad espresso and my boo had a latte. Friendly, knowledgable staff. No wait at all. Best coffee I've had since I was in France. I've been trying to find a place worth visiting. I'll be back! Ps. Their drip coffee looked absolutely phenomenal. ", pos 
Elixer Coffee ," 2/10/2012 I really like this place. I usually drive past it on the way to work and have always wanted to stop. Well today was that day!  From the highway it looks like a cute little truck with a neon coffee sign. When i pulled up to the food trailers, there was a line in front of the coffee truck. The first thing i noticed was how nice the guy was that was serving coffee. He was really having fun and I don't know about you, but i really appreciate someone that is nice and courteous. The next thing i noticed was the excellent prices! I felt like they were competitively priced. I really liked his espresso machine. It had cool handles where he would push it down and then push it up to extract the shot. He said it was a 20 year old machine and the pistons gave him ultimate control over the shot. Nice touch!  The coffee was excellent. I ordered a Spiced Brown Sugar Latte. The drink was smooth and creamy. It wasn't bitter at all and not too sweet. It was exactly want I wanted it to be and more.  A nice final touch was the fact that they have a 512 Rewards punch card. Rather than wasting paper and space in your wallet on a business card with holes stamped/punched it in, they opted for a mobile app. It's an application that, when installed, the user can scan a QR code and add a ""virtual"" punch to their card.  All and all, I will defiantly be going back to this business and would highly recommend for anyone else to as well. ", pos 
Elixer Coffee ," 10/16/2011 Coffee... trailer... definitely Austin. These coffee trailers are going haywire in Austin, and nothing is stopping them! This one is tucked back into the new Mueller trailer park off of Airport. I pulled in one morning, and I loved the trendy looking buzz set up right in the back of a ""watermelon"" truck.  The offerings are straightforward--with tax included being a major plus. My cup of joe was going to be the Starter Fuel: pour over with a shot of espresso. It was rich, dark, and potent--certainly able to perk me up, as I am not a caffeine junkie. At $3 flat, it will certainly fit a buzzed up individual's budget.  The guy out front on the nippy morning provided some great service, and that made my black all the better.  Good set-up, good location, and awesome product and service. What more do you want out of a go-to coffee joint? Oh, and the trailer aspect fits right into Austin. ", pos 
Elixer Coffee ," 7/9/2011 I can recommend both the lattes and the cold brew coffee at Elixer, the cold brew packs a serious caffeine punch. They also serve scones etc. from local bakeries.  What makes the place really stand out is the atmosphere. Service is exceptionally friendly, and espresso drinks are only $2 if you bring your own cup.  If you're driving up Airport Blvd as part of your commute, the location at the old Mueller hangar makes them very convenient for a quick caffeine fix in the morning. ", pos

Cafe Ruckus ," 2/28/2016 High tea?  Otherwise known as how to stuff your face with more scones, pastries and finger sandwiches than any adult should eat in their lifetime, washed down with vast amounts of tea.  What's not to like?  The high tea served at Cafe Ruckus is a fine exemplar of this Fellini's Satyricon for Anglophiles.  Great tea. (I particularly endorse their mixed berry tea which is one of the best herbal teas I have had anywhere.)  Definitely tasty little finger sandwiches. Cucumber sandwiches are a must for the genre and their cucumber sandwich is pretty good.  This allows you to pretend you are being delicate before pulling out the heavy guns and going whole hog on the scones.  The scones themselves are first rate.  I offer a particular shout out for the chocolate scones that have chocolate chunks the size of the Houses of Parliament.  They offer lemon curd, raspberry jam and clotted cream to go with the scones - and those are nice on the currant scones.  They are pure overload on the chocolate scones -  which in this case means, go ahead and slather the jam the curd and the clotted cream right in there!  And naturally after all that jam, and chocolate and lemon curd, you still have to have dessert right????  The petit fours are first rate ...  but the secret star of the show dessert is a thin frosted chocolate mint cookie they slide in next to the petit fours.  You think this is going to be just a modest filler - but it is a completely delightful mint cookie.  And yes, there is still room for delight even after cramming down all the other stuff.  To be sure, you may come into Cafe Ruckus looking like Virginia Woolf, and leave looking like Winston Churchill.  But high tea is all about personal growth.  You have erudite conversation to expand your mind.  You eat a trolley full of pastries to expand the rest of you.  God Save the Queen! ", pos

Cafe Ruckus ," 7/15/2015 yeah.  I love stopping by here while walking the dog in the morning. Not nearly enough places have a window for you to order outside, plus they have a water bowl for our 4-legged friends! I like a good, strong latte which they do well but what sets Cafe Ruckus apart is how friendly the staff is. Constantly friendly and always smiling, every time! I wish they had a little more variety to the breakfast tacos offered though, the mashed potatoes in 2 of them are just... weird. I didn't even finish them. A basic bacon, egg, cheese taco would be great. ", pos

Cafe Ruckus ," 10/7/2015 Updated review Update* owners reach out and apologized and offered a refund which is very sweet (+1star for that) My first visit to ruckus, I ordered my drink, a few people came in after me and the barista took their orders and began making their drinks. I thought maybe the other lady working was starting mine but after 10mins and everyone behind me getting their drinks I realized they forgot about me. I walked to the front and she asked if I needed anything, completely forgetting I had ordered. She eventually made my drink and offered a coupon for a free drink next time. Ok cool. When I came back in a few weeks later to get the free drink the barista handed it back saying it was months expired. So after bad service they gave me an expired coupon. Pretty disappointing every time I went in so I won't be returning. ", neutral 
Cafe Ruckus ," 3/4/2016 Whoa!  The sarsaparilla tea was the best steep in town. It has the aroma and earthiness of tea with the sweet finish of root beer.  The food is surprisingly filling for just finger foods and I'm a pretty big eater. We had the Brie and turkey which was carefully hand crafted and trimmed like the other sandwiches appeared. You can really taste the quality of ingredients because the sandwich themselves are very simple yet tasty.  The scones are the best in town in comparison to places like the steeping room or other brunch places because they are not only better consistency but also almost twice the size!  Scones are a must with the clotted cream spread. I recommend the chocolate chip scone.  Finally dessert is very innovative and well presented. Cake pops are so last year with their little cake cube bites. You don't feel guilty eating like 3 because they are only a few bites each. Lastly the atmosphere and staff is incredible as you are treated like royalty in their small party events. This is the perfect places for a quick breakfast/brunch bite, tea, or a party event as they have a assortment of board games. High tea Sunday! ", pos 
Cafe Ruckus ," 6/22/2014 If it wasn't for the wonderful quotes on the outside sign, you might not know that this cafe was located here. Okay, the big old RUCKUS sign does help a little.  The cafe has strong and deep, rich coffee. I had an ice latte and a salted carmel milkshake. The milkshake is not for the faint of heart. Unbeknown to me, it was filling and rich enough to be my lunch ... wow, how great is that! (It is best to finish the latte first, give yourself a little time, and then move onto the milkshake.)  We, also, purchased some of the Ruckus Roast beans and will try that out tomorrow and provide an update later.  There are sandwiches there, but they are made off site and then brought  in. They do have Saint Arnold Root Beer. See all photos from Van T. for Cafe Ruckus ", pos

Cafe Ruckus ," 7/20/2014 5 check-ins Still great, even after the Yelp event I attended here recently.  I loved this place so much I was excited to head back with some girl friends during a day downtown.  It's small, but so full of character.  I love the community events they hold here, game nights, music nights, and even afternoon tea parties (pre-registration required).  Mr. Ruckus was playing barista the afternoon I came and I had the delicious Mexican Mocha.  We reviewed the great diverse collection of board games and selected a 1960's classic girly ""pick your date"" type game.  We had a blast just hanging out sipping our coffee's and playing the game.  It was great to see others coming in doing the same us.  At one time there were 3 groups of us playing games.  I think one couple even brought in their board game.  This place is all around awesome, clean, friendly service, amazing coffee, and all natural St. Arnold's root beer on draft!  If you have your furry friend with, no worries order at the outside pick up window, and sit down at one of tables on the sidewalk.  I just wish they had some gluten free pastries in the mix.  The coffee roasted here is a special blend mixed up by Keith Ruckus.  He partnered with Texas Coffee Roasters and added his special ingredients to come up with the Ruckus roast.

Cafe Ruckus ," 1/28/2014 3 check-ins To quote the movie Dumb and Dumber (said with British accent):  ""I like it.  I like it a lot"".    Cafe Ruckus is pretty cool.  This is largely in part because the owner Keith Ruckus is pretty cool.  Keith is part of the Alamo Drafthouse Action Pack family.  Don't be surprised to find him working the counter.  He's really nice and down to earth.    Their coffee is from Texas Coffee Traders.  My original idea was to get coffee, or maybe a chai since I heard the chai is good.  But upon investigation of their menu I discovered that Keith's sister has put together a super-fantastic tea menu (Rori's Tea Room) with tea leaves she has selected from all over the world and it. is. Delightful.  The tea comes in a small pot with a strainer, and you can get full tea service if you want.  I had Candy Apple White and thought it was really great.  I found myself craving it days later.  I have a feeling return visits for me are going to include lots of tea.  Other features:  root beer on tap and glass bottles of Topo Chico and Mexican Coke.  You can have them make you a float since they have ice cream.  They also have pastries from Quack's bakery.    The seating inside is limited but somehow is still roomy.  There are plenty of outlet strips.  They have a window facing 2nd street that you can order from and a small table for outdoor seating.  Parking is a bitch in this part of downtown.  However the really great indie/art house Violet Crown Cinema is upstairs across the street and they validate up to 4 hours of parking in the AMLI parking garage if you buy a movie ticket.  You should come have a coffee or tea after a movie. ", pos

Cafe Ruckus ," 8/14/2015 Their iced coffee is no ordinary iced coffee. It is cold brew and if you haven't had cold brew coffee, you're in for a treat. Cafe Ruckus' cold brew is the best damn coffee I've ever had. Seriously. This coffee is no joke.  I would drive across town to get this coffee. As the barista told me while I was there, ""it's legit"" and that boy ain't lyin'. ", pos 
Cafe Ruckus ," 1/15/2014 This place is great because there's finally a coffee shop in the abandoned old coffee shop place and even though there's coffee shops all over downtown, this area needed one. Not to mention it's just downstairs from work. The vibe is a hodgepodge of existing decor and some of the owners personal flair as well.  Their americano was hot, nutty but it left an aftertaste that I couldn't get rid of for a while. I dunno. Besides that, the prices are reasonable and they have pasties and Mexican coke for those looking for something else than coffee. They also have a loose leaf variety. It seems a little pricey but hey, what can you do. Good selection though. I hope this place lasts. Good, friendly people and that people look passed the new Starbucks going up down the corner and support the locals. ", pos

Cafe Ruckus ," 9/12/2015 First time here today and the Iced Mexican mocha with soy was the bomb diggity and it is in a very convenient location. Edited to add that I remember in the middle of the barista making my drink, a woman came in with her child asking for the restroom key.. The barista stopped making my drink to give the lady the key and returned to making my drink without washing her hands.. I've never worked in the food industry, so I don't know the rules, but perhaps she should have washed her hands? That was kind of gross to me and I am not a germaphobe, but I imagine bathroom keys are not sanitary. ", neutral

Cafe Ruckus , 5/3/2014 1 check-in Really love this place. Super friendly staff and yummy coffee. My favorite spot to chill before an ACL taping at the Moody Theater or catching a movie at Violet Crown.  For you coffee connoisseurs Cafe Ruckus has a custom La Marzocco that they grind out some of the finest beans available in the land.  Family friendly game night happens every Monday night but an assortment of board games are always available to play for free. Plenty of sidewalk tables and chairs to enjoy an iced coffee in the gorgeous downtown Austin 2nd Street District. , pos 
Cafe Ruckus ," 6/21/2015 One of the best espresso macchiatos I've had since moving to Texas from the PNW. The owner, Keith Ruckus, really knows what good coffee is and he takes pride in his work. Laid back atmosphere is gljust right on a rainy Sunday afternoon. ", pos

Cafe Ruckus , 5/26/2015 Nice quick spot for coffee. Friendly staff.  Small area with a decent lounge area. Nestled in a not-so-busy area of 2nd street. And prices are relatively fair. Give it a try and see for yourself. , pos 
Cafe Ruckus ," 8/1/2015 Best High Tea in Austin.   I took my mother to high tea for Mother's Day at Café Ruckus. The petit fours, scones and finger sandwiches were delicious and more than we could consume in one sitting. Yay for leftovers! We sampled more than one tea, and the choices were numerous and delightful. Rory (co-owner with her brother)  served us with attentiveness and warmth.  Ruckus is the best. ", pos 
Cafe Ruckus , 3/15/2015 1 check-in Visiting for a second time. Such a cute and small coffee shop. Love the lavender but always stick with vanilla. Staff is super friendly. Yay for ruckus!!! , pos 
Cafe Ruckus ," 4/5/2014 I work just around the corner and so I go to this place VERY often. I'm a fan.  Service is chill, friendly, timely. The drip coffee is great - medium or a dark roast. Since they usually only set out half and half, I ask for almond milk and they are happy to oblige.  The only espresso drink I've had here is an iced almond latte and it was like dessert in a cup - so creamy and delicious. It was amazing.  I really want to try their pastries. They have breakfast tacos in the morning, usually from The Vegan Nom I think.  Cool neighborhood joint. ", pos 
Cafe Ruckus , 8/7/2014 Love this place for casual work environment. Staff is friendly. Place is clean. You gotta ask for the key to the toilet which keeps the place cleaner than most.  Coffee is top quality. I've had many of the baked goods. All terrific. , pos 
Cafe Ruckus ," 7/6/2014 1 check-in Great bang for the buck!  I stopped by here yesterday afternoon to get some work done and lucky for me, it was deserted. YES. The wifi was free and fast, I was able to get a great seat by the window with the large circular window and desk and get some work done. My cappuccino was a bit too foamy and the blend was so-so, but at $3 in the warehouse district, appropriately priced. While I was there, other folks came and ordered iced drinks and milkshakes - it was pretty popular and I imagine there's a lot of foot traffic due to its proximity downtown. Last, if you have to go to the bathroom - just make sure you go to the front counter and ask for the key. Great for work or casual hanging-out and there were some outside tables for those willing to bear the heat!  LPT: You can walk up to the to-go window off of 2nd Street and order without going inside!

Cafe Ruckus ," 1/20/2014 10 check-ins Cafe Ruckus is the place to go! I had a chai tea latte here and it was amazing! I usually frequent Starbucks and I love their chai tea lattes, but really- this was so much better. They also sell a variety of pastries and they have saint Arnold root beer from a tap! Yum! Another great thing about this cafe is that they have games! The staff are also super friendly and you feel right at home. This is a great place to go chill and get some coffee alone or with friends- go check it out! ", pos

Cafe Ruckus ," 1/13/2014 40 check-ins First to Review I swung by here on it's grand opening day and tried some of their affogato and a latte. Delish! Everyone was chipper and smiling behind the counter, the owner was there again shaking hands and schmoozing, and the crowd was lovely. Tasteful decorations, comfortable color scheme, and plenty of light; it's a pleasant place to sit and sip your coffee or meet a colleague for a snack break. If Keith is there, ask him any random question you want and you will be entertained for at least twenty minutes as he spits his opinion. Apparently he's some sort of poet or sumpin... And make sure you ponder a clever Ruckus pun before arriving to make your visit more entertaining. Just don't expect it to be better than Keith's Ruckus puns :P Cock-a-doodle-doo! They sell t-shirts! Busy night! See all photos from Chad A. for Cafe Ruckus ", pos 
Cafe Ruckus ," 3/6/2014 This place is great!  First of all the coffee is great.  Keith, told me that it's their own blend and I really love it.

MORE DRAFT ROOT BEER! ", pos

Cafe Ruckus , 5/3/2014 1 check-in Love this place!  Great people watching. Good location. Love the chai! Environment is cool and casual. Very welcoming fun staff.  I'd be coming back for game night on Mondays!    I ordered a 'Strong Chai' and got one of the best Chai Tea Latte I've ever had anywhere.  The pastries are awesome and fresh.  The espresso and iced coffee are the best in town. I think it's the machine and the beans are roasted locally. , pos 
Cafe Ruckus ," 3/20/2014 The atmosphere is retro and casual, the hours are good, the location is great for late night people who like to take walks downtown, and the prices are way too fair.

Cafe Ruckus ," 1/20/2014 I am so glad this place exists. Not only did I feel very taken care of as a tea-drinker (ask for Rori's tea menu!), but this place has some fun specialty drinks and  a solid selection of caffeinated and non-caffeinated beverages. The pastries are yummy, too, and they've got ice cream -- which seems to be a hit with parents and kiddos who stop by after hitting Toy Joy next door.  The atmosphere  is charming, quiet and cozy, but still manages to be fun -- they have board games, after all.  The staff is friendly. Cute place for a date in the evening, and a relaxing place to get some work done during the day. I met a friend there on our lunch break, and I left feeling refreshed.  Update: I came back in during a warm day, and I have to say -- their ICED Red Berry tea is to die for! ", pos 
Cafe Ruckus , 10/23/2014 Love this place!  The relaxed atmosphere and friendly staff create a perfect environment to enjoy homemade sweets and coffee while listening to local musicians.  One of my favorite places in Austin! , pos

Cafe Ruckus ," 1/24/2014 Cafe Ruckus is a quintessential, friendly, and easy-going coffee shop. The coffee itself is great, and the atmosphere is perfect for a quiet meeting, place to work for a while, or just to stop by for a few minutes to get a caffeine fix. They also seem to have a great selection of loose-leaf teas. And root beer on tap! Unusual, but I love the variety. Also the staff is really friendly. There are a bunch of places downtown that are trying really hard to be either oddly upscale or hipstertastic, but this place just feels down-to-Earth and comfortable. ", pos 
Cafe Ruckus ," 1/19/2014 Was in town visiting and had an opportunity to try this place out. Very nice, great cappuccino and pastries, very comfortable place. Nice area to just sit inside or outside and chill.  And, of course, they have Wifi.  What more do I need? ", pos 
Venezia Italian Gelato ," 10/21/2016 This place looks very unassuming on the outside but its a very nice, quaint transport to a world of awesomeness. It's definitely a place I can see an Austinite sitting down on any given day to work at a cafe.  The owners are really nice charming people, knowledgeable and passionate about their gelato, knowing how to appeal to the italian roots they're proud of in their gelato as well as tastes for the american palate.  That said, EVERYTHING I tried was off the charts amazing in flavor. Smooth, velvety gelato that's not too sweet, with fresh cream and fruit flavor (for the fruity ones). I think particularly noteworthy are the cannoli and stracciatella - the stracciatella as an all around favorite for our group and the cannoli has bold vibrant flavor. I personally liked the cherry as well - tasted sweet, like fresh picked fruit. Cream cake is also good if you're into that kinda thing. And though the cheesecake looks very fruity and you'd imagine denseness, its very light and comes off the palate with a very clean cheesecake flavor (the fruit compote type jam on top helps cut the richness I guess).  All in all, you can get a cup of happiness for not that much more than any other ice cream shop in town and you clearly can't go wrong, so come on by. ", pos 
Venezia Italian Gelato ," 11/19/2016 Mmmm the gelato is so tasty! I came here for a dessert date and had the Tequila flavor with lime and blackberries. It was very fresh and had a teeny tiny taste of tequila in it. I would love to come back and try some of the other flavors and baked goods.  The inside was very clean and stylish. Only downside was a small parking lot and lacking in outdoor seating. Also, it'd be nice to have more variety in coffee. Other than that I like this cute cafe! ", pos 
Venezia Italian Gelato ," 10/19/2016 If you're looking for a relaxing European coffee shop experience in the midst of a an increasingly boxy South Lamar--here is your oasis! This gorgeous little Italian cafe and gelato shop.  Operated by a delightful couple of folks (the gentleman can whistle like a Disney bluebird!), this place has coffee that tastes like you're on vacation and treats that are flaky and scrumptious. The ambiance is as balanced and sweet as the gelato. This place will chill you out and improve your afternoon. It's worth a little splurge for a Perfect 10 cafe! Cheesecake gelato and also a Coffee-type that was seriously so insanely DELICIOUSAAAAAA. Treats and Gelato ", pos 
Venezia Italian Gelato ," 8/31/2016 1 check-in Cute little shop run by a gorgeoussssss couple. I mainly came here to try their gelato donut on a stick aka the Mr. Ring! They ran out of the chocolate ones when I arrived with my family, so I was disappointed about that and the woman told me there was only one white chocolate left and the rest were either cotton candy or lime, which I dislike both flavors so I chose the white chocolate.  The Mr. Ring is not made with an actual donut. I've been wondering what was inside and how it tastes, but mine was filled with vanilla gelato on the interior with a hardened white chocolate exterior. This is great for Instagram photos and for the experience, but the taste of it was only decent. The gelato filling is kind of melted and frothy, which is understandable because it's more challenging to freeze the inside effectively. If anything, I would only repurchase this to try out the chocolate flavor. Otherwise, I'd stick to their regular gelato selections.  My mom and older brother both got gelato cups and every single flavor I tried was absolutely delicious! My all time love of my life here would be their Venezia, which is the very liquid, smooth and creamy, dark and rich chocolate fudge. It is sooooo goooood. Another winning option would be their cheesecake! Yumz. And my mom adored the peach gelato. Cappuccino is delish too. Just get everything. ;)  Service was super polite and sweet. The parking lot is really tiny and it's on a hella busy street. We got lucky there was one parking spot left, but good luck to those of you on the struggle bus! Don't give up! Or at least give up and come back later LOL. I really like it here. Next time, I'm having my eyes set on their coffee and more gelato cups. Display case. Beautiful gelato flavors! ", pos 
Venezia Italian Gelato ," 7/14/2016 1 check-in I don't know. There seems to be another gelato place here in south Austin popping up with a few more. I'm pretty sure we will see a season of Gelato Wars on TV or in the newspaper. I have to admit though I don't know what is good gelato or bad gelato. As long as it doesn't make me sick, I'm fine with it.  I see photos on yelp for gelato shaped like donuts. Immediately I must go and check them out. Luckily they had a banner which said GELATO out in front otherwise I would have been wandering up and down Lamar looking for this place. The parking lot is small and space is very limited. Once you get inside, it's a cute, modern cafe with one case full of the gelato donuts, cake and tiramisu. There's another case full of the gelato. You can ask for a sampling of the gelato and I had the cookies and cream with cappuccino. As a result, it was pretty good gelato. Strachelli and cappucino Tiramisu and donut shaped gelato ", pos 
Venezia Italian Gelato ," 12/3/2016 Great Gelato and friendly service. Dangerous that this place is almost within walking distance. My GF got the stracciatella and said it was just like the kind she used to get when living in Rome (she hasn't been able to find any like it since getting back to Texas). The gentleman that served us also mentioned that they will soon have fresh house made cannoli which are one or my guilty dessert pleasures, so we will definitely be back very soon. ", pos

Venezia Italian Gelato ," 8/13/2016 1 check-in Venezia Italian Gelato is run by an Italian couple. I had a moment to converse with the owner (the kind lady) and she was so sweet. She works practically all day--wakes up bright and early to make the gelato and service her customers.  I got the 2 scoops of gelato for $4, which isn't bad. I had the hazelnut and peach gelato. The peach was very peachy (duh, right?)--it didn't taste artificial or bland. It has a hint of sourness, but a great flavor for a hot summer day.  They only allow you to try 2 samples and ask that you keep your spoons for environment's sake, which I fully appreciate. Overall, I'll give this place 3 stars + 1 star for the lady's service. The decor was nice, definitely a great study spot. ", pos 
Venezia Italian Gelato ," 6/26/2016 1 check-in Ahhh gelato. Takes me back to summers in Germany, and traveling the canals of Venice. There is something so delicate about the flavors, compared to ice cream.  Venezia Gelato does not disappoint when it comes to bringing that delicacy from Europe. A small with 2 flavor choices is about $4.50, with a medium being 3 choices for .50 cents more. Quite the steal compared to other speciality ice cream in Austin.  However, I'm floored at the interior of the shop. Ultra modern, with everything in black and white. Large windows face Lamar, and Mom's Tattoos. It's very clean, and neat, with some relaxing music playing in the background.  Obviously a family affair, they greet more family who shows up in support. Out of the 3 flavors I tried, cappachino, pecan and hazelnut... The hazelnut was my favorite. Will be back to try new combos! My ice! Beautifully displayed Lovely selections ", pos 
Venezia Italian Gelato ," 11/13/2016 Ice cream donuts? Yes, it is true! They make donut shaped Gelato goodness and I am not sure what the outer coating is but I think just cream/sugar/yogurt and the inside is filled with gelato. We visited here the other night and my husband ordered THREE - he just could not stop eating them. I had a couple samples and ordered the vanilla and chocolate, so original I know, but they were good. I am used to the type of gelato that is more icy and not so creamy, but this is still good. ", pos 
Venezia Italian Gelato ," 6/2/2016 1 check-in I have definitely been on a gelato craze, so I was happy to discover a new spot sort of close to home! The parking lot is kind of small / hard to navigate through, so it would be best to try to go during non-peak hours or after the business next door is closed for the day! (they have about 3 or so spots reserved for that business).  The decor is absolutely beautiful! I loved the black and white theme, if I hadn't decided to stop using snapchat, I would have been snapchatting very inch of this shop. Even the gelato was beautiful! But let's move on to the flavors...  I ended up ordering a small with mint & apple cinnamon. The flavor choices I picked were probably not the best combination wise, but they were both so good, I couldn't resist. My partner ordered a small with cherry & passionfruit. I thought the coffee flavor was great, but I was so insistent on the apple cinnamon, I chose to forgo that since THAT flavor combination would've been even more weird! Overall, I thought each flavor I sampled was great, it was a matter of which flavor I wanted. The biggest thing I noticed about the gelato was how light/icey it was. I've seen to grown to like more creamy textures, so I was a little sad when it wasn't as creamy. However, I would come back & recommend others to check it out! Small mint & apple cinnamon, small cherry & passionfruit ", pos 
Venezia Italian Gelato ," 5/30/2016 Came with my friend 10 days after they opened.  First impressions: lots of seating, very beautiful decor.  Their gelato was pretty good. 4/5 stars because comparatively to other places in Austin, I wasn't blown away.  Their mint gelato was REALLY good, however. Exceptionally.  Because of their ample space, would be great for large groups of friends to hang and enjoy some gelato. Good selection ", pos 
Venezia Italian Gelato ," 8/15/2016 1 check-in My friends LOOOOOOVE this place. They come here once a week.  I thought it was very good & the owner looked very nice.  Cherry cheesecake was good-- looked amazing with graham crust crumbles on top. I thought it could use a little more cream cheese but that's just me. Passion fruit was really good-- tart & rich. The hazelnut chocolate is suuuuuuper rich and delicious but maybe too rich for most people.  This is a good, safe place to get gelato. They have flavors that are very typical for most Americans (""donuts"" ""vanilla"" ""coffee"" ""mint"" ""chocolate coconut"" and have a few exotic flavors ""passion fruit"" ", pos 
Venezia Italian Gelato ," 7/30/2016 There is a lot of hoopla about gelato places in Austin and I just haven't seen what all of the fuss is about. Most of them don't offer what I consider real gelato. Venezia is in a league far above the rest.  Nicola and Alice are not only awesome people (Nicola in particular also has a great handshake), but they're slinging some awesome gelato too and the clear best in Austin in my opinion. It's even as good as what I've had in Venice, Italy where they hail from. They have genuine passion for what their creating here that you can easily tell and taste.  I first came over a month ago and last came a week ago and see they are getting busier and busier which I love. I plan on coming much more. I'm a big fan of their espresso too. There is now real gelato in Austin to enjoy! Ben fatto!! ", pos 
Venezia Italian Gelato ," 9/27/2016 Simply awesome. This is the place for gelato. When I was in Austin I was a regular here.

Everything is just perfect. ", pos 
Venezia Italian Gelato , 11/20/2016 1 check-in Omg this place is so awesome and the gelato is DELISH!!! I have a dairy and gluten allergy and had me covered!

From Italian to Italian this is the BEST place for gelato in Austin! , pos 
Venezia Italian Gelato ," 8/7/2016 Ooh talk about authenticity! The Italian couple who opened this moved from their home about a year or so ago. Love the store layout and the gelato (please do not call it icecream) is so pleasing to the eye! They also have vegan flavors. Got the dark chocolate along with raspberry - both were vegan (I'm not vegan but it works in my favour since I'm mildly lactose intolerant) but man oh man, you cannot tell it apart from dairy ones. This has to be THE best dark chocolate gelato (or uh, ice cream) I've ever had in the world.  Owner and the employee are very friendly and nice to talk to as well. Going to keep coming back for it! What a yummy display. Sadly we didn't have tummy space for this. ", pos 
Venezia Italian Gelato ," 7/22/2016 After a lousy day, I wanted to bring my wife here as a little treat.  I'd read the great reviews and was hopeful they'd have some great gelato, and we weren't disappointed.   We tried a few samples of flavors including cheesecake and passionfruit and everything was tasty.   In the end we both went with pistachio and cherry which was made with a tart Italian cherry and was absolutely delicious.  The pistachio was nicely rich and nutty with real pistachios and not the fake green dyed atrocity you find at a lot of places.  I got a macchiato to go along with the gelatos and it was rich, roasty, and really went well with the gelato.  The owners were both very friendly and I wish them lots of success here.  We at least will definitely be back! ", pos 
Venezia Italian Gelato ," 7/6/2016 1 check-in Listed in 100 in 2016 It's such a pleasure stumbling upon delightful little local places! Venezia was one of those stumbles.  Decent parking for it's S. Lamar location and spectacularly clean on the inside, I had high hopes from the moment I walked in. The woman at the front greeted me with a huge smile immediately and made me feel welcomed and wanted. She patiently waited as I decided what to order. Great customer service! Venezia serves up various flavors of handmade gelato and coffee. I stuck with the Gelato this time around, but would love to try their coffee too.  A small gelato gets you two decent sized scoops for  $4. The best part is that you can choose two different flavors, even with a small order. I ordered the cheesecake flavor and the chocolate biscuit flavor. Both were amazing! The gelato was perfectly creamy and each flavor was strong and distinct. I also tried the pistachio and the mint chocolate chip which were equally amazing.  I recommend coming here for a tasty pick-me-up. You won't be disappointed by the exceptional customer service or the amazing gelato! ", pos 
Venezia Italian Gelato ," 7/14/2016 1 check-in Yummy yummy Gelato!!!!!  We drive through S. Lamar quite a bit and every time we pass this place I always say ""I want to go there."" Well we finally got the chance to and our experience was amazing!  We both have had gelato before. L.C. had it in Italy and myself in Hawaii (lol lame, I know). But the owner of the place is so so so sweet, and so welcoming. Educating us about gelato, the flavors, and how he makes them daily. We love to see people passionate about their businesses. Especially L.C. he loves conversation!  A tip: you can taste 2 different flavors at one time to see if they combine well! We got a kick out of that.  The sizes are small (2), medium (3), large (4), and they refer to how many scoops you desire. We both got mediums. They are open late too so perfect for after dinner! The flavors we liked were chocolate coconut, pistachio, cappuccino, black biscuit (Oreo), hazelnut, & mint. ", pos 
Venezia Italian Gelato ," 8/9/2016 nice sweet treat. a little pricey 4 dollars for 2 scoop of ice-cream on the cone, but they are organic ice-cream, clean and no chemical which is a plus..  I love hazelnut favor. yum.... ", pos 
Venezia Italian Gelato ," 7/10/2016 My friends told me this was _the best_ and they weren't lying! This is my new favorite dairy treat spot in the entire city.  Venezia is a welcome addition. I'm a sugar snob, and I take my ice cream products seriously. I've had gelato everywhere from Rome to Richardson, and this is by far the best. Creamy and delicate, every bite was amazing. The flavors were the typical gelato flavors (hazelnut, pistachio,) with some extras thrown in (cookies and cream, strawberry cheesecake) and three vegan flavors for about 12 to 15 flavors to choose from.  I couldn't decide and had strawberry cheesecake and cherry. Both were rich and tasted so FRESH. It was like they had made it right in front of me (they didn't, but you could have fooled me). The service was super-friendly as well.  I highly recommend this place; just be sure to leave me a parking spot. ", pos 
Venezia Italian Gelato , 6/29/2016 1 check-in I have been DROOLING over the photos of the Mr. Ring for a few days now. I FINALLY got to try their gelato and Mr. Ring...  OH. MY. GOSH. It was delicious. I finished my Mr. Ring before I even left the parking lot! I love gelato and I love chocolate covered anything...so this is the perfect marriage of my 2 favorite things.  I sampled some of their gelatos and they were so delicious! The pineapple gelato is dairy free and tastes like I'm eating a pineapple! YAS.  What's even more awesome about this place is that their gelato is non-GMO and artificial color free! WOO HOO. I'm a total convert. I'll be walking over here so I can eat one Mr. Ring there and eat one on my walk home. , pos 
Venezia Italian Gelato ," 12/4/2016 Awesome addition to the growing South Lamar food scene and a great dessert or decadent snack option. Authentic gelato with creative and sophisticated flavors with the added bonus of luscious Italian pastries and exquisite coffee.  Even a modest selection of gourmet sandwiches.

Venezia Italian Gelato ," 6/20/2016 I'm joining the chorus to say that Venezia is fantastic! Everything about my pop-in for a gelato on a sweltering summer afternoon felt authentically Italian. The proprietor is friendly and proud of his offerings, the flavors are familiar and yet somehow elevated, and the store is modern, spotlessly clean, and surprisingly large.  I went for a traditional pistachio and hazelnut for my first visit while my friend opted for two fruit flavors. All were so delicious that we were plotting our return trip before we left the store.  I want to tell everyone about Venezia because it may be a little less showy than some of its counterparts around town, but it is damn fine gelato. The real deal. ", pos

Venezia Italian Gelato ," 6/19/2016 After sampling several gelato places across the country, Venezia is by far #1 on my list.  The favors and variety are exceptional...to say they are incredibly delicious is such an understatement!!  The authenticity of true Italians cannot be matched, each time I've been in, and it's been several...the owners have always been so nice and treating everyone as if they are long lost friends.    The decor is kept clean and simple with a black and white theme.  If you haven't been... You must go; and go now!!  Enjoy!! I'll see you there!! ", pos 
Venezia Italian Gelato , 11/25/2016 Stopped in after dinner with a few friends for something sweet. Glad we did! Really enjoyed the dark chocolate and mint gelato combo I created. My friend had the pistachio and it was gone before I could even try it! Tutto perfetto. , pos

Venezia Italian Gelato ," 5/26/2016 3 check-ins My wife and I met Alice the owner, and we were welcomed in a very friendly manner.  The owners are brand new here; they came here straight from Italy so you know this is the real deal.  Compared to the other gelato places in Austin, this place's flavors are lighter but still taste very desserty.  The consistency is more like ice cream -- but healthier I guess? Right?  You must come here nowwwwww. ", pos 
Venezia Italian Gelato ," 6/19/2016 1 check-in I've been trying to decide whether or not I should keep this place a secret. But I want them to do well and figured, I shouldn't be selfish. So here I am writing a review for the best gelato I have ever had.  Venezia is located off of South Lamar, right next to a tattoo shop, and if you blink, you might miss it. It doesn't have flashing lights waving you down saying ""THE BEST GELATO HERE"" but it does have the Italian flag, which pretty much says they're legit, no?  Upon walking in, we were greeted straight away with warm smiles. The owners are so sweet and friendly, and that made my whole experience that much better. The wife took care of us, allowing us to sample whatever we pleased. I tried the Passion Fruit, to which she made sure I understood to try the whole sample at a time, so that all 3 layers of flavors would mix together. And boy was she right. As soon as I took the entire sample, my eyes grew bigger and she could see that I was amazed! It was so delicious, words can't even begin to describe it.  My boyfriend and I ended up getting the Hazelnut and Passion fruit gelato. No regrets there.  The decor inside is cute and simple and if I could, I would live here. When we left, the owners said their thank yous and I quote, ""ciao"", still with smiles on their faces. It was 10 minutes before their closing time, and they still had a positive attitude.  From the moment we stepped foot into the place to the moment we stepped out, they were welcoming and I can't rave enough about the service here. The gelato was fantastic but the experience was even better.  I want this place to stay open for a while and possibly for forever. I want this husband and wife duo to succeed, so go. Go out and support this business, because I have never felt so much love for and from a place before. Passion fruit on top and hazelnut at the bottom ", pos 
Venezia Italian Gelato , 8/27/2016 Amazingly perfect! The inside ambience and the people makes it a must visit place. I read the online review and went there to get Mr.Ring! The owners gave me a warm welcome and they offered to decorate the Ring for the occasion.  Service was one of the best. The owner also offered me few flavors of Gelato to try (even though he knows i was not there to buy gelato). The flavoring was top notch.  Will be definitely back to try their coffee range and buy more Mr.Rings and gelato! Best place to hangout. , pos 
Venezia Italian Gelato ," 8/30/2016 1 check-in I absolutely fell IN LOVE with the Ferrero Rocher gelato. I had it served with one scoop of the coffee flavor in a medium cup, where I quickly ate up the coffee just so I can savor the Ferrero Rocher. It was total bliss and I was immediately saddened that I didn't go up one size.  The amiable Italian owner added an even sweeter impression to our first visit. We asked him about the Tiramisu and even though my boyfriend didn't understand his accent, he was sold by the man's passionate description and tried it out.  I didn't even bother to try the Tiramisu, nor the Mr. Ring's (gelato donuts) which I originally went in for, after sampling the gelato. I'm now on a mission to find a gelato place in Houston that tastes as good, if not, I'll be coming back real soon! ", pos 
Venezia Italian Gelato , 11/2/2016 I have been looking for a gelato cafe for a while and I found it. This is my favorite place for Gelato! The Ferrero Rocher gelato is wonderful. The people working there are very nice and the cafe is very clean , pos 
Venezia Italian Gelato , 6/25/2016 This place is absolutely amazing! The people that work here including the owner are so sweet and helpful...

Definitely a cool spot to come relax and have some coffee and fun donut gelatos! , pos 
Venezia Italian Gelato ," 8/25/2016 2 check-ins Venezia was one of the few places that stayed open late on a weekday evening, and when we walked in we were greeted by very neat decor and the happy faces of our Italian-accented hosts behind the counter. The gelato was very good; I had salted caramel and something else I don't recall. I do recall that my wife and I were quite impressed with it, enough to promise ourselves a return visit. We'll be back. ", pos 
Venezia Italian Gelato ," 7/28/2016 1 check-in My family and I are quite fond of gelato, so once we heard there was a new good spot down south, we had to stop in and try it out.  It wasn't that difficult to find their business, but the parking lot is small.  They allow two sample for free before making your selection.  My son chose a small with two flavors, my husband had a waffle cone, and I chose a medium because I wanted three flavors.  I had the passion fruit, mango, and cappuccino.  I think the passion fruit was my favorite because it had a thin layer of chocolate and was the perfect combination.  We all enjoyed our treats and will definitely return next time we have a craving for gelato. ", pos 
Venezia Italian Gelato , 9/11/2016 Very good authentic Italian gelato. Great espresso also. The owners relocated from Italy and are very passionate about their gelato. Nice people. Found my favorite gelato in Austin! , pos 
Venezia Italian Gelato ," 8/21/2016 Amazing. I loved the cherry gelato. I also had the Italian cream, which was eggy and delicious, and the crème brulee which came with raw sugar on top. Everything was good. The store is very cute and I love that they serve espresso. My girlfriend really liked the stracciatella. I only wish they let you try more than two samples. That cheesecake flavor was calling to me, but I'll have to save that for another day. ", pos 
Venezia Italian Gelato ," 10/30/2016 I had the MR RING and it was AMAZING!!! Also, they let me sample a couple of gelato flavors who he were equally as incredible! The service is great and very helpful and the pricing is reasonable. I can honestly say this is one of the best gelatos I have ever had and will definitely be going back! ", pos 
Venezia Italian Gelato ," 7/19/2016 Updated review 5 check-ins Still just as good as the first day I visited, but I would reconsider coming if you have a nut allergy. I brought a friend who does have one and found out that she couldn't have anything there. The owners only have one mixer since they're still new and they use it for every thing. I don't believe they have a sign up for that, so hopefully this gets the message out. ", pos 
Venezia Italian Gelato , 8/13/2016 Friendly Service and Awesome Iced Coffee. Definitely recommend the cherry gelato too , pos 
Venezia Italian Gelato ," 7/30/2016 1 check-in I had a small sized gelato, half cherry and half pistachio.  Gelato was nice and smooth. Pistachio tasted like real pistachios, just as it should and was not overly sweet. It was very good.  The cherry was lovely. Again, not too sweet and a bit of tartness from the pieces of cherry.  It also had a sort of jelly/jam like topping as they scoop it, which had a slight tart/sourness to it. I sampled the cheesecake and passion fruit, both were delicious. Small size is perfect because the gelato is rich and flavourful. Very friendly service and the pricing is right.  I'd much rather pay $4 for a delicious gelato here, than $7-8 for gimmicky ice cream you can get at other places. I'll be back! ", pos 
Venezia Italian Gelato , 7/17/2016 1 check-in The real deal traditional Italian gelato in Austin. Not sure what to write other than go here for the real deal. Still love Dolce Neve for non-traditional tastes but If you want a true Italian experience in the heart of Texas this is THE place. As an Italian man in Austin I can attest to the Gelato being true to its Italian roots.  Bravo! , pos 
Venezia Italian Gelato ," 9/25/2016 Austin needs more spots like this. The gelato is very tasty, and the coffee is great. We're excited to see what Venezia comes up with for their breakfast menu... We went in today and learned that they are serving breakfast from tomorrow. ", pos 
Venezia Italian Gelato ," 7/23/2016 Not to toot my own horn but I'm sort of an amateur gelato aficionado of sorts. I sometimes pull an all out Ratatouille and spit out freezer burned ""gelato"" out of my mouth in Austin because let's face it, most of the gelato here in our great city is not legit.  Enter Venezia Gelato. This great couple has been in Austin for a year straight from Venice and they serve up the most authentic gelato on this side of the Atlantic. I seriously haven't had better gelato in Seattle, LA, or Vancouver BC. So I am extremely happy we have a great spot here in Austin now.  My favorite surprise was the chocolate which was almost a frozen high quality cake frosting (the only way I know how to describe it which doesn't do it justice) which paired extremely well with my cookies and cream. Not to mention Italian true espresso to complement the ice cream and close out the day. The decor was modern and quaint and this would be the perfect spot to bring a date for lunch or after dinner. Bravo! ", pos 
Venezia Italian Gelato ," 8/26/2016 First off I have NEVER posted a review before. This place is soooooooooooo amazing that I just had to. They serve authentic gelato, tiramasu and chocolate mousse. They even make donut shaped gelato pops. Mmmmmm. The dining room is so beautiful and clean. The staff was very nice and the hours are perfect. Open til 11 Tues thru Thurs and til midnight Friday and Saturday. Check this place out. You will fall in love!! ", pos 
Venezia Italian Gelato , 7/18/2016 1 check-in Made a special trip to try this place out after seeing such great reviews. I went for the Mr. Ring and it was delightful and decorated beautifully. The mint gelato may seem like a basic choice but I assure you it is a choice you can gladly make.  The owners described their offerings to us with such passion which really added to our great experience. Here's hoping they open a second location that I can get to more quickly! , pos 
Venezia Italian Gelato ," 6/10/2016 ""I'd have to get a second job if this were closer to our house,"" said my husband after our first visit here. Every flavor more delicious than the next. Super authentic gelato. I'd say this has claimed the title of best frozen dessert in austin. ", pos 
Venezia Italian Gelato , 9/8/2016 Mm they had a hazelnut nutella type gelato in summer. Coffee gelato is good. It's right next door to the tattoo shop. (I missed it driving past last time) They have delicious gelato & the man & woman who own the place are from Italy & so nice & welcoming & always having good conversation with the customers. A perfect gelato business we're lucky to have in Austin! , pos 
Venezia Italian Gelato ," 6/5/2016 BEST GELATO EVER!!!! I spent a summer in Sicily and tried a few other places in Austin that I like, but this place is hands down the best dessert you will ever eat! The owners are an adorably sweet couple and the actually remembered me and my friend a month later at our 2nd visit! It's kind of tucked away on Lamar and hard to see so I hope the word gets out. They let you try any flavor, but it's so hard to choose! Seriously you have to stop by ", pos

Venezia Italian Gelato ," 7/1/2016 Best gelato in ATX (and believe me, I've tried the all). The only bad thing is that all of the flavors are amazing and it's impossible to decide which one to get. I ultimately got the pistachio, hazelnut, and cherry. The nutty flavors in the pistachio and hazelnut are incredible. And the cherry is not too sweet and made with luxardo cherrys, giving it a ton of delicious depth. Only other place I've had gelato this good is Italy! Best gelato in ATX! My favorite flavors are the pistachio, hazelnut, and cherry. But you really can't go wrong with any of the flavors. ", pos

Venezia Italian Gelato ," 5/1/2016 1 check-in I noticed this new bright light beacon in the night as I was driving through my hood down Lamar. And was pumped when I noticed it said Gelato. YES YES YES! So I tired it out last night. When we walked in, I was in love with the decor, the open air of the place, and the super friendly owners and their family that was there. They said they just opened and seemed so excited to show us their products. I've NEVER seen Gelato like this. I think that means all the other ""gelato"" places in Austin, most likely aren't the real deal. My gf and I tried pretty much all the flavors. They were amazing. I don't know how I picked just two! I can't wait to go back and see more new flavors each week. This is great, so close to my house, and so yummy! A WIN FOR '04!!!! ", pos

You can tell he loves his gelato. Gelato heaven at Venezia ", pos

Venezia Italian Gelato ," 5/8/2016 Hands down, the best gelato I've ever had. In fact, I'm not sure I can even say I've had proper gelato after having had theirs.  There's so much flavor packed into each scoop and their flavors are phenomenal. My personal favorites are the chocolate hazelnut (imagine Nutella but 1000% better) and passion fruit.  The owners are so friendly and kind which only adds to it all.   My Italian friend says this is as close as it gets to what you find in Italy and I'll believe her.  Plenty of parking and places to sit and enjoy this little gem of a place. It's quiet now because they just opened but it's not going to be long before they're packed out. ", pos

Venezia Italian Gelato , 8/16/2016 This place is a must if you want authentic Gelato!! Try the cherry gelato. The gentleman helping us explained that the cherries are shipped from Italy.

Of course, my husband looked at me in disgust and said ""what do you mean just a tea?'  (we were on vacation and it was odd for me not to get alcohol with every meal) so I snapped out of it and said you're right make that a bloody mary and I am so thankful I did. They have a homemade pickle infused vodka, which I must say I was iffy about, but it was AMAZING.  To make the bloody mary even better they have a bloody mary bar where you can add any garnish you wish...and boy did I add everything offered!  As far as brunch goes, the food was great and the atmosphere was nice (don't let the front of the building deter you).  Definitely give this place a try!

After i had my drink I realized they have a lot of house made alcohol which I regretted not trying. But, it is a great spot to drink, people watch and catch those Austin vibes. Places like this remind me why I made the big move and service was great. In my drinking, I came back in time to catch some tunes from a local band who had the whole outside area jamming to their cover songs as well as their own original tunes. I'm always a fan of good live music and they delivered. Big time. I can't wait to get back to try their brunch and mimosas. If you know me, I'm a lover of those. I am eager to try their coffee as well, as I hear it is quite good. That's my other vice, good coffee. ", pos

That is fortunate for others as my concept was simple yet brilliant. So here I go to a place for the first time. This is definitely a dive, but a friendly one, with a great mixture of ages and backgrounds. Hey, if I was running for office in Austin, this would be my campaign headquarters! I really wanted a Bloody Mary, or 5, but I could  not have any alcohol, so a sweet and generous lady of the group figured out a sparkling water and OJ combination. Perfect! Parking is on two sides.

On one occasion, came here at brunch time on Sunday.  Had the ""range grits"" which is venison and antelope on top of grits.  It was excellent but smallish portion relative to the price.    The coffee is good.  For those of you that like to work out of cafés,  this could serve the purpose.  However - the wifi was not great one of the times I went...worked out fine next time though.  Friendly, helpful and efficient service. Venison on grits Fire pit raging ", pos

The Buzz Mill ," 1/21/2016 2 check-ins Tuesday - live music that was chill, bluesy but not too overpowering so conversation was possible in tables away from the stage and inside. Decently full for a week day.  Dranks: There is a bloody mary bar that is pretty fabulous (on the weekends? don't quote me on that) but it offers a variety of coffee beverages, beer, and coffee spiking options so meeting a buddy for drinks can include the alcoholic variety or not.  Food: I've tried a vegan quiche? or some other vegan item I was unimpressed with and ended up feeding to a hungry ridgeback (his eyes asked politely) and the inside furniture is not the most comfortable, but I might just be nitpicking. The food trailers run out of food sometimes (like the bbq trailer) so get it while it's hot, but the options are pretty good for a coffee shop.  Parking: There are lots on both sides of the coffee shop, so don't let your maps app confuse you and use the back parking if the front is out of space.  Space: The ample seating outside with picnic tables and benches are good for groups small and large to sit together and move around comfortably. Overall worth the buzz. Hah. I used a pun. ", pos 
The Buzz Mill ," 10/9/2016 1 check-in Wow, this place just exudes the Austin vibe! It also has amazing cheesesteaks, great espresso, and the friendliest staff in Austin. Buzz Mill is also extremely pet friendly (cheesesteaks are served from a food truck) and the best for last, GREAT beer selection at affordable prices - *Tip* PBR is always just $2 if you're really on a budget and remember to put the Whiz on your cheesesteak, it's simply not the same without it.

The Buzz Mill , 11/14/2016 One of my favorite spots to go to study off campus because it's out of the way and not as packed with college students. There's plenty of outdoors seating and is connected to some food trucks if you get hungry! , pos 
The Buzz Mill ," 3/2/2016 1 check-in So.............kind of a throwback beer garden. New age hippies, hipsters and young folks. I'm surprised no woman was nursing a baby. This place has a funky vibe and I love the music stage because it's just the right size for small bands. They also have a cool variety of beers on tap and in bottles. Go by and warm up by the fire, grab a cold beer and you just might hear 1977 in the background. What? No nursing baby?!?!? ", pos 
The Buzz Mill ," 4/25/2016 1 check-in Love this coffee shop/bar so much. One of the best things we like about Austin. It's laid back, services great coffee and beer plus tons of cool infused vodka and other liquor concoctions. Plus an outdoor stage for live music and food trailers to the back for BBQ and tacos. The perfect combination all around. Also love that they have a quiet room where you can work in peace without annoying people on the phone, talking loudly etc. oh and did I mention they're pretty much open all night??

The Buzz Mill ," 10/29/2016 Great coffee and  fun atmosphere! I loved the strong and rich flavor of the decaf americano that I ordered. I was here around 11pm on a Friday, and the place was very lively and active (especially outside). They have an open outdoor area with many tables and its own small bar. Inside there was  a quiet side study nook, which I will definitely be back to utilize! I liked the unique decor and music as well. The only reason I'm going with 4 stars is because it wasn't super clean. Overall, I enjoyed my experience here and will be back! ", pos 
The Buzz Mill ," 12/8/2015 3 check-ins Ambiance: Pile on the plaid, but leave the axe at home. This is as Appalachian as it gets in Austin. The cozy inside resembles a lumberjacks cabin adorned with a raw wood bar, bear decor, and rustic, intimate tables. The outside it vast and open with community seating for large parties or social butterflies. They also have smaller tables for parties of 2-4. The stage often hosts musical acts, or BuzzKill comedy every Wednesday, but you can escape the noise if you want a quiet night on the side of the building or past the back bar. Hip bulb lights and a fire pit light up the space and allow clear visibility even on the darkest night.    Cuisine: There are, how I see it, four options to eat at Buzzmill. All are good options. 1. There is a randomly opened food truck that serves mostly burgers, but also Sunday Brunch. 2. There is 1776 Cheesesteak that I should write a separate review about, since it's so good and authentic. 3. There is a small selection of sandwiches and healthier items in a cooler inside. 4. There is tons of beer for those on a liquid grain diet.  Service: The line to the bar can get a bit long, but I believe the new bar system and the addition of the outside bar will alleviate this issue on even the busiest nights. I am a repeat customer, so I get treated well at Buzzmill. Overall the staff is great. Especially the coffee guy, Hey Thor! ", pos 
The Buzz Mill ," 2/13/2016 1 check-in I visited on New Year's Day and absolutely intend to return. The staff were manly and agreeable, and the space was rustic and simple. Quite simply,  it's a good place for a 1990s esque coffee break. This place gets a bonus because I love that there's a boozy bar conjoined to the coffee bar for Irish coffees, and that the cost of a whiskey coffee runs $6. Also, amig@s, check in on yelp and get a dollar off!  It's peaceful and quiet inside, particularly in the back room where I was able to begin and finish Gillian Flynn's new short story.  I'd be interested in seeing standing catered food options from regional classics like Taco Deli and Swedish Hill;  when I went the food truck out back was closed and so I went without. Boys,  feed me AND give me a quiet place to read over my boozy coffee, and I'm all yours. ", pos 
The Buzz Mill ," 5/25/2015 1 check-in Love the concept of this place: want to study? They've got coffee, free wifi and a ""quiet hall."" Want to meet up with colleagues or friends? They've got indoor and outdoor seating, beers on tap, and original infused liquors like pecan whiskey and grapefruit gin for cocktails. Want to soak up the rays with your favorite furry friend? Dogs are allowed in the outdoor areas. Hungry? Buzzmill's own Ironwood BBQ is cooking from 11 to 11, and numerous other food trucks frequent this place. Prices for coffee ($2-3), beers (there are 5 dollar drafts and $3 PBR), and food ($7-11) are all reasonable. Plus, check in on yelp and you get $1 off a coffee drink!  Whether you're looking to wake up or wind down, this open-24-hours coffee shop and bar is a good choice. PS, try the lemongrass rose gin--it's phenom. Cucumber melon rum, pineapple blueberry rum, strawberry basil mint vodka, spicy mango tequila, and many more. ", pos 
The Buzz Mill ," 4/29/2015 2 check-ins I just love this place so much. Just SO MUCH. I study here, I get drunk here ... I love it. $2 PBR pints for when I'm feeling cheap. A $5 craft beer when I'm feeling fancy. Maybe some crazy infused whiskey. Or cold-brewed ice coffee if I don't fee like alcohol (hardly ever).  I mostly order ""The Bear Hug"" tho. It's $5 for a shot of whisky and a pbr.  **food trucks have changed in recent months. It's now Ironwood BBQ and a Cheesesteak place that offers a vegan option!  Always entertained by the live music or comedy. Except holy crap when a band is playing you literally CANNOT have a conversation. They blast the music so damn loud. So if it's a date don't go sit outside expecting to get to know each other during the nights/times there's a band. Unless of course you think it could be an awkward date... in that case DEFINITELY go so y'all don't have to talk to each other. Whatever.  They have outlets some areas outside for lap tops so that's good to know in case no space inside. You can grab Apples to Apples, Battleship, Connect 4, etc. from the shelves in ""The Quiet Hall"" (literally exactly what it sounds like). AND IF YOU'RE STUDYING IN THE QUIET HALL DON'T BE A DICK AND TALK ON YOUR CELLPHONE. some ppl... mannnn....  AND OF COURSE MY FAVORITE PART... THE STAFF! Everyone is so damn nice. Which you may not get that first impression probably just cuz they're super busy a lot but since i've been going there often you get to know everyone and they are all super fucking rad. Alan, Santiago, Mike, Rocky, Seth, Desiree, Esteban, Travis, everyone else I'm forgetting... LOVE YOU GUYS! Chillllllllen with a $2 PBR ", pos 
The Buzz Mill ," 10/29/2015 2 check-ins It doesn't matter if it's day or night, the Buzzmill's open and waiting to pour you a beverage. This lumber-clad cafe/bar is open 24/7 and makes about a dozen house-infused liquors as well as a strong cold brew coffee. Why not combine the two into a cup?  The large courtyard has a firepit and a lot of picnic and high-top tables to chill with your friends. There's always people around, even at 2AM on a Sunday night (ok, technically Monday morning). Free wifi, food, and the aforementioned beverages make this a great spot I visited several times during my long weekend stay in Austin!

The Buzz Mill ," 10/23/2015 1 check-in The Buzz Mill is a great addition to the neighborhood. Great (and cheap!) beer selection and a nice strong cup of coffee. The events they hold here are awesome and appeal to all kinds. You like comedy? boom. You like live music? Boom. They've got it!  I've heard theres brunch here but, never tried it! The busiest day of my industry is a Sunday so, I've given up on brunch anywhere. However, I love that there's delicious (again, cheap) BBQ in the back!  You would think with how positively I talk about the atmosphere and amenities that I'd give it 5 stars. However, they lose not one BUT TWO stars for their service. I mean, come on dude. EVERY single time I've gone in, the bartenders are indifferent and treat you like crap. They seem extremely bothered by each of their orders and if it's because they're busy most nights, they should probably bring in more staff to relieve a little stress. Perhaps more cigarette breaks for these busy guys? I don't know. I just wish they were a bit nicer. I want them to be just as happy as I am after I've ordered at the bar, sat down, stewed about the rudeness and got over it. ", neutral

The Buzz Mill ," 2/23/2016 The think possibly the best thing going for The Buzz Mill is that they are open 24 hours. It doesn't hurt either that they have ample outdoor sitting, live music, a fire pit (if memory serves), and an assortment of home-made infused whiskeys I'd be interested in trying some time. I have yet to have more than tea here, but the couple of times I've been it's been a-ok. ", neutral 
The Buzz Mill ," 3/3/2016 This has been my favorite bar in Austin ever since I hit legal drinking age. Not only is it a bar, but they offer caffeine fixes 24/7 for all my studying needs. I've spent countless nights studying my ass off here.  Plenty of seating (they constantly add more tables/chairs), food trucks out back, Voodoo donuts, board games, infused alcohol, the best/nicest bar staff in the city (most of the time)...I could go on and on but this is just a place to experience for yourself. A good mix of people for people-watching as well. Every time I go, they have some kind of new addition. I hope this means they are doing AWESOME and will stick around for years to come.

The Buzz Mill ," 8/27/2015 3 check-ins Okay...can we say east side chill? It's pretty much my local hangout. Log cabin interior, resident stuffed bear, and infused whiskey makes this place wicked bad! Add to that the food trucks out back and the free wifi and its a great place to hangout after work, before bed, or on the weekend.  The AC isn't that key inside and inside there's some limited seating out front. There's a bunch of searing outside, but in this heat even in the shade it's oppressive. Great in the winter time.  Also...I hear the coffee is good. I'm no coffee drinker, so I can't attest. But, what I can say is that I did get a cup of coffee from buzzmill one night when I was making a red velvet cake for my boyfriend's birthday and this cup made the recipe outstanding!!! ", pos 
The Buzz Mill , 2/22/2016 We went there for brunch on Sunday with a big crowd and That place is awesome!! The manager was super nice and would stop by our table some and see how everything was.  The staff was equally friendly. And I like the music that was playing. It's fun it like frontier land.  I had the Elk Chili Hash with two fried eggs!! OMG so good!!  The outside patio is a great place to bring your pooch - but please keep it in on a leash. And part of the tables are covered - it's very relaxing out back!! Even with some people smoking it was not bothersome. , pos 
The Buzz Mill ," 7/31/2016 Place is awesome. Good coffee, good atmosphere, good beers, good cocktails featuring a bunch of infusions bla bla bla. Would have given it 5 stars but the bartenders are your run of the mill Austin dooshery that think they are way cooler than everybody and give you the classic attitude and the whole cliche bit. Good news is there really isn't any seating at the bar so you don't have to listen to them talk to each other for all that long. All that being said it's a great spot and I'm sure they are fine people, at some point ", pos 
The Buzz Mill ," 8/22/2016 Not the worlds greatest coffee, but the infused liqueurs are a welcome change to the standard bottle options at other bars and the outside area is as laid back as you can get.

The Buzz Mill ," 1/4/2016 1 check-in awesome place for comedy on Wednesday nights. Beer is decently priced and they have an amazing fire, if you can find a spot.

The Buzz Mill ," 2/4/2016 Used to really dig this place but the vibe has gone downhill. Every time I'm there, there's a long line inside that creeps slowly. Then I get major attitude from the bar keep and I swear, I'm too sweet and polite for my own good sometimes. I hate feeling like I just gave my money to get shat upon. In addition to this, their ""food"" inside has been inedible every time I've gotten anything. Months ago I got a donut on a late nite impromptu splurge visit and it was the worst donut I've ever had. And that's saying a lot. I love the concept, love the 24hr thing, and love the fact that they have music. But just to go and hang and frequent a joint? Nope, no longer. ", neutral

The Buzz Mill ," 7/28/2014 4 check-ins Listed in 365 in 2014:DONE!, Dive right in! Buzz Mill is a really unique, cool spot in east Austin. Drive up, see the massive sign, park, get out and look around...and suddenly you realize you've stepped back in time to the Old West or as others have stated ""Lumber Jack Land!"" Greeted by a huge stuffed bear at the entrance and then to the wood carved coffee/bar counter...watch out for that beaver sticking his head out! Buzz Mill is certainly themed; however, not overly done (a.k.a. cheesy). Divey, yet somehow a tad trendy at the same time.  Vast coffee assortment. Local roasts available. I don't indulge in the caffeinated stuff, but my husband ordered a cup of simple drip ($2; $1 after getting a $1 off Yelp check-in offer!) and he said it was great. Smelled good! I was also thrilled he wasn't buying from overpriced Starbucks (yup, I am a hater of the corp!). Buzz Mill apparently offers great coffee and the prices on the board are certainly appealing. Great java for ya dolla!  This ""coffee house"" also has a full service bar. A few beers on tap, some in bottles, and an inviting assortment of over two dozen house-made infused liquors (""elixirs"") such as Apple Cinnamon Whiskey, Blackberry Sage Tequila, and Pineapple Rum. Having had a ""pickle shot"" before and really enjoyed it (I know!), I opted for the Spicy Dill Pickle Vodka. Umm...very very strange. Not very dilly, and ""spicy"" = nutmeg and cinnamon spicy - not chile', hot pepper ""spicy."" None for me again thank you. Also had a $2 Hamms - cheap beer for cheap price- call me happy cheap person.  Next, into the ""backyard."" More wood ""fort-like"" stuffs about. Large space with plenty of tables, dog water bowls everywhere (super pet friendly - yay!), a small stage, and two food trucks! - BBQ (Blue OX) and Vegan Tacos (The Vegan Nom). If you're hungry, which we were, oddly different choices but both great......yes, we sampled a bit (ok, large samples) from both trucks. Couldn't resist.  So visit Riverside, grab a drink of your choice, head out to the patio and enjoy some meat and/or tofu, hang out with cool people and even cooler dogs...and...just enjoy!

They have had good live music the last few times I've been here too, so it's nice to have a choice to sit inside and chat or sit outside and take it all in! It's well worth the visit. Be prepared, there isn't much parking here. ", pos 
The Buzz Mill ," 3/9/2015 I am wavering between a 3 and a 4 star rating for this place. It's got a cool vibe, two food trucks available (bbq and vegan food), and plenty of seating indoors and out.  However, the service was slow the two times I've been here and I was kind of offended by the barista. I ordered a macchiato and was told, ""You know that they traditionally have two shots of espresso and a touch of milk foam?"" in the most condescending tone of voice. Yes, in fact, that's why I ordered it. I understand that there is probably confusion about drink names and content, but they didn't question my S.O.'s order.  Just sayin.  Anyway, it's fairly busy on weekend nights, but not so busy that you couldn't find a seat. 2 parking lots make parking fairly easy as well.  I like it for the ability to bring together my meat eating friends with my vegan friends, but I'm not sure I'll be back anytime soon. ", neutral

Awesome woodsy decor, friendly staff, nice large outdoor seating area. Lots of games on hand if you're hanging out.  The flapjack breakfast was great. Comes with bottomless flapjacks, 1 slice of bacon and scrambled eggs for $7. You have to purchase $1 tickets for extra bacon or eggs.

The Buzz Mill ," 12/3/2013 10 check-ins I first found this place to experience their version of Oktoberfest.  I am so glad my friend dragged me here, as this is not a typical place I would have stepped into on my own by just driving by, and boy would I have missed out on a treasure.  This place is so unique and eclectic, and truly has something for everyone.  Not everyone could make such a diverse place work, but this place hits all the right notes for a 24 hr. spot.  I truly hope that with all the urban trendy construction going on around this place that this logger lovers haven doesn't get engulfed or over run.    Buzz mill is a wooden shack with a large fenced in outdoor wooden fort like paradise complete with one of the best BBQ food trucks - Blue Ox.  There is a wooden stage, covered eating area, and some tables out in the open.  You will even find a large wooden Jenga game to play with.  Inside you will find some seating, board games, and free wifi.  If BBQ isn't your style, there may be something to eat inside.  You can get some vegan breakfast related items brought in from outside vendors, or select from a menu of smores for dessert and roast your own marshmallows at your table.  For beverages you have quite a few options, draft beers, infused wiskey/vodka, and quality espresso coffee drinks.  I am picky with coffee, and the espresso here is great.  I haven't yet had a chance to try the infused drinks.    They also partner with Blue Ox for a Sunday Brunch.  They host a Bloody Mary bar for $4, and $2 Mimosas.  All of which are yummy.  A unique community gathering spot which hosts it's own lumber society, sword making nights, and other unique events.  Definitely not to be missed.

The Buzz Mill ," 12/19/2013 5 check-ins 24 hour coffee shops in Austin are often overshadowed by Epoch and Bennu. I have been guilty of this myself until I discovered The Buzz Mill!  Don't be intimidated by the bear logo sign at the front; it's actually quite a welcoming place. If you can get past the lumberjack feel, then you will appreciate:  1) It's a 24 hour coffee shop WITH BBQ! Whaaaaa? That's right, who needs baked goods and stale bagels for a late night snack when you can get some meaty, fatty BBQ. For clarification, The Buzz Mill is a stand alone coffee shop, they just have a food truck called The Blue Ox that serves BBQ. They operate in conjunction, but The Blue Ox stops serving at 2 am, or until they sell out. I'll write a separate review just for the BBQ. 2) The atmosphere is a little bit of everything. When you first walk in there are big tables for group study. Then walk past the ordering bar and you'll see a strip full of cubbies for 1, 2 or 3. This part was my favorite ^_^ There's also an outdoor campfire area where the occasional band will put on a show. Andddd, THERE'S A HUGE JENGA SET! Life is complete when you have a huge jenga set. Oh, this is also where the BBQ food truck is.  Some things you might not appreciate:  1) The tables in the cubbies are kind of small, especially the ones for 2 people. It's definitely going to be a squeeze for your stuff so you might want to reconsider bringing your 50 pound Intermediate Accounting book. 2) If you're a coffee fanatic, bad news. There's a very limited coffee selection. Not really a problem for me, but I know it bothered the friends I came with.  I came here twice in a span of 4 days and I'm positive I'll be back again. This is the new and improved Epoch/Bennu. Cubby area Cappuccino ", pos 
The Buzz Mill ," 9/11/2015 The amount of blind dates I've seen here is startling. Maybe because it's got a huge outdoor patio with food, music, a fire pit, and 2 food trucks..so there's plenty of distraction if things don't go as planned. They're open 24/7 which is rad, they have about 8 different infused liquors like berry lemonade vodka and grapefruit gin, as well as coffee drinks and beers on draft. The food does seem to shut down pretty early, as well as the live music, but it's still a chill, Texas feelin kinda place. I go here to study/work a lot too, they have a secret quiet room with some booths that are good to spread out and get some work done on. I've been here 3x in one day, no shame. Riverside needs more places like this, show some support and skip Starbucks! Came here with this little babe ", pos

The Buzz Mill ," 4/13/2016 This place was def a gem I was not expecting. The atmosphere is great. The little treats are interesting. I went to get some studying done and was told this place was great for it. There is a small area that's ideal for hitting the books, if it wasn't so crowded. I went in the afternoon and people were already ordering shots of vodka, that should tell you how I fared with my studying. No complaints seeing as how it is a cafe/bar but I think the majority of the noise came from the staff. ;p That being said the treats are interesting. I've always wanted to try a maple bacon donut and had it been filled with something like a custard it would've been perfect. Limited coffee menu which made it easy to pick out the chai as my choice of drink. I've had better. Will definitely come again if not for the log cabin feel or lumberjack men behind the bar. ", pos

I had an house infused vodka rocks the other day that was downright dessertlike.  A coffee shop: Are you a coffee snob? Come on over, friends! Their coffee is outrageous (and outrageously strong.) Not only that, but you can buy growlers of their cold brew!  A restaurant: Or more accurately, a food stand. The pork loin and brisket at Blue Ox are some of the best I've had. And I've eaten some meat y'all. They've got the OG Franklin smoker and they are doing great work with it.  Put on your plaid flannel and head on out to Buzz Mill. It's kind of hard to find (look for the DQ sign) but it's one of those special Austin places that Riverside is going to grow up around. See all photos from Kelly S. for The Buzz Mill ", pos 
The Buzz Mill ," 1/1/2015 2 check-ins BuzzMill Coffee is more about the environment than it is about the beverages. They feature a small selection of coffee and tea type beverages alongside a small bar and custom infused liquors. With an outdoor seating area, this is a great place to bring some friends and chill over drinks and board games (you can definitely bring your own), and there's even a bbq trailer (Blue Ox, I think).  The drinks themselves are kind of lackluster, but the checkin deal is pretty helpful ($1 a coffee drink). I've had the chai and the cappuccino there and they were both a little bit watery in taste (I think they prepare the drinks before hand and add the ingredients together and heat it up). The infused liquors were a letdown too with the walnut whiskey tasting incredibly harsh. I can only imagine that they used some of the cheapest whiskey they could find.  Otherwise, the staff is pretty chill and they provide pretty decent service. They're all friendly people, but make sure you're going for the environment and atmosphere rather than for the beverages.

The Buzz Mill , 7/26/2015 1 check-in The food tasted great. I got the brisket and my friend got the ribs.  The only thing I didn't like is the very small portion of meat and the fact they only have small bottles of Mexican coke for $2 I was expecting more for the price. , pos

He will write you a poem if you have boobs. He will read you that poem if you kindly ask him not to.  The beer is a bit pricey, but that's just Hipster Tax you're dealing with. ", neutral 
The Buzz Mill ," 12/28/2014 9 check-ins I'm almost a regular here...just need another week in Austin.  They don't seem to close. There's a whole area in the back to work with outlets. They have a cache of board games to play, and a huge outdoor patio with food trucks.  They serve up the usual coffee shop drinks and teas. They also have a full bar with a dozen liquor infusions, and a decent selection of beers on draft. I'll see if I can rent an apartment upstairs from this place. ", pos 
The Buzz Mill ," 11/12/2014 I REALLY like the vibe at this place. Really wooden, rustic, communal, homey. They had a fire going, chairs everywhere, pecan pumpkin whiskey and live music. I can definitely see myself hanging out here more often! The BBQ my friends got looked really good too! ", pos 
The Buzz Mill ," 9/3/2015 First off, a great neighborhood bar that I love getting food, inhouse infused booze, and dirty chais from. Beyond that, I really dig having a 24 hour cafe to walk to during my insomniac writing hours. My favorite spot after working crazy late hours for the service industry. I've come to love this patio.

The Buzz Mill ," 8/9/2015 When you want a slightly dirty little coffee bar with a dirt floor seating area outside, a few good beers on draft, and a little stage from which you can hear some great country or blues, you probably want the BuzzMill.  I've always found the drip coffee to be a bit lacking (it always tastes a day old), but their barista's make a good shot of espresso and get their americano's just right. They don't have many beers, but the ones they do have are rotated regularly and are always great.  Ample parking, and lots of bike parking. Very dog friendly as well (thanks to the outdoor seating area).  Food wise there are two food trucks outside, and they often have tamale's inside (which are excellent). ", pos

I found out about it until I went to Walgreens before I went to work. It's the feeling of looking for a treasure without really looking for it.  It was hot and humid. Instead of going straight home to the comfort of my AC and watching TV, I decide to go ahead and check out The Buzz Mill. I loved it. I decided to get some coffee.  It's small and dark on the inside. If there's no room then you go to their patio which is pretty awesome as it reminds me of one of the bars on Rainey Street. Patio has various games such as a homemade skeeball called a Skoo Ball. Brilliant piece of homemade DIY wood work if you ask me. Then there was giant zenga, cornhole, card games and other games.  The cool thing also...it is open 24 hours and it's close by! Score! So beautiful in the early morning hours. That's right fools....SKOO BALL!!! It's on!!!! Patio full of board games, cornhole, skoo ball, giant jenga. ", pos

Incredible infused vodka options?  Yup, that, too!  The bartenders and staff were super friendly and helpful when I was undecided.  Super attentive. ", pos 
The Buzz Mill ," 2/11/2016 Kind of has it all. Pretty good draft beer selection as well as lots of coffees. They have a more ""quiet"" room for studying/reading or soft conversation and it stays fairly quiet in my experience. Sometimes their main room area gets a little loud, but there's always the cool outdoor area too. Firepit, games on the tables, food trucks, and sometimes live music. I've been there to meet friends I haven't seen in a while on many occasions and its always easy to talk and catch up, or play the games outside like apples to apples. I've also been there for morning coffee or to work in their quiet area. ", pos

Bitchin' food trucks in the outdoor patio area.  10/10 would dine again. ", pos

The Buzz Mill ," 4/12/2014 2 check-ins Listed in Crafty Cocktails!!, Best part of waking up How have I lived in Austin for so long and not been here?! (I've since been back two more times in 7 days).  House-made infused liquors ftw: Grapefruit gin. Pecan bourbon. Cucumber rose gin. Vanilla orange vodka. and more.  They don't have a cocktail menu. You drink that shit with soda and you like it.  As if it couldn't get better than that: They serve beer. Good beer. It's open 24/7. There is a giant grizzly inside. There is lots of wood. It's kinda grungy, but it works. Big patio. Dog-friendly. Live music at times. Mini skee ball games. A BBQ trailer. Some kind of all-you-can-eat pancake thing on the weekends.  Oh, ya, it's called Buzz Mill, I hear they also serve coffee here.  I want to move in. ", pos 
The Buzz Mill ," 9/18/2014 1 check-in I mostly like the fact that this place is always open and it's across the street from my apartment. The coffee is a little bitter for me, but with much doctoring, I can adjust it to my liking. The homemade teas, however, are great, and I will suaully opt for the tea :) I have yet to experience the BBQ out back, but it is definitely on my short list of things to do.  I must mention though, if you want to come here to do work, and think that you can do so in their ""quiet area"" reserved for non-talkers.... you are sorrily mistaken. Unfortunately, people do not know how to  read signs, so more often than not there will be some chatty Kathys back here. ", pos 
The Buzz Mill ," 4/29/2013 10 check-ins Favorite coffee bar in austin. I would never have found this gem had it not been for WAKA dodgeball. What an awesome place. Like uncle toms cabin with a full bar. And the uber friendly staff is at its core. Very cool people. Only had one bad experience but that was due to a patron. He was playing skeeball and i asked a question, turns out Dave Navarro does have a FUGLY white twin. Other than that, ask for a columbian neck tie, or a BuzzMill (black maker, chilled with a splash of soda water).  Then venture out to the patio and sit by the fire on cold nights, listen to live music from the stage, or order a heaping plate of BBQ from the Blue Ox truck.  This place is bound to be a good time. Checking in here also gets you $1 of a coffee. New ox ", pos

The Buzz Mill ," 3/25/2014 4 check-ins Not gonna lie, I honestly thought I was going to be murdered by a man wearing bear skins and toting an axe in his overalls when I first stumbled upon this place at midnight. It's not in the greatest part of town and the outside display isn't exactly screaming rainbows and puppies (pretty sure it's an angry bear or something). Stepping in, I was clearly wrong. It's a pretty chill place. It's good for a casual night out with the lads and even better (in my opinion) for a late night of studying if you get sick of campus and/or your apartment.  Things they done right:  1) 24 HOUR COFFEESHOP?! Wish I had discovered this way sooner in my college career so I could have studied in cooler places. Cuz honestly, as a senior now, what the hell is studying? 2) Booth area. Very quaint and cute. Basically begging for me to sit there all night to ""study"". Also, they have outlets at every single booth thing. Gotta be able to juice up, y'all. Very crucial to any study session. That and electricity for your power guzzling laptop. Read that again slowly. 3) BONFIRE FIRE PIT THING OUTSIDE. Y'all. Fire is cool. 4) Pretty decent selection of beers on tap like the 512 PECAN PORTER. Guys, I love this beer. 5) Apparently, there's a BBQ trailer in the back where the fire pit is. Guyyyyyys.  Things they done less right:  1) Booth-cubby-things are made for two people and are reallllllly tight. I imagine it's more for the free spirited student types who sit there with their notepad, pencil, a plate of BBQ, a shot of espresso, and a beer to chase. Not super conducive to an engineering student's needs. Or anyone who likes to put their elbows somewhere besides jammed next to their ribs. 2) I think they only have 4 coffees to choose from on the menu. Don't get me wrong, I could ride a 512 Pecan Porter all night every night. But shockingly, alcohol doesn't help you study, nor does it keep you awake, so sometimes, a cup of Joe is needed to do the trick. And honestly, they really only have the bare bones for coffee there. Don't expect some fancy French stuff or whatever. 3) God awful heavy metal screamo stuff they put on every once in a while at the 2 o'clock hour. Then again, if you're stuck with the night shift at a 24-hour joint, play whatever the hell you want, am I right?  Don't worry about how it looks on the outside, y'all. It's what's on the inside that counts. And the inside holds BBQ, beer, and coffee. ", pos 
The Buzz Mill ," 11/13/2015 Single best find since I've moved here. The atmosphere is great. The music is great. The servers are great.  It's craczy to think that I would be studying at a coffee/bar place, but I am. I love love love this place ,and will be back to study again.  Study: There's inside seating and outside bench sitting. Inside may be a bit loud, but it's warmer now that fall is here. Outside is cool and have plenty of benches to study at. There is a nice fireplace if youre reading. I would recommend bringing headphone. Once i plugged mine in, I am ready to study.I will say that it gets louder later into the night since plenty of people come here to hang out. Wifi is great. I was able to stream class video and listen to spotify without any issue  Music: They have live music everyday except for Wed and Sun. They have live comedian on Wed. Today was my first visit, and I LOVED the live music. I actually took off my earphones to study to live music. Now, this is a true Austin experience.  Drinks: They have many things on tap. Happy Hour is 5-8pm. I ordered the tea, and the server graciously allowed me to refill my hot water a couple of time.  Food: They sell food here. I didn't get any so I dont know much about it beyond that it smelled good.  Cost: For $2.5 I was about to study, listen to live music and enjoy not being in my room. I can take that.  Parking: There's not that much parking, but you can park on the streets. So there.  Only con: the bathroom is tiny and there are plenty of people here who need it from all the alcohol, so it may not be the nicest bathroom I have ever been. ", pos 
The Buzz Mill ," 2/10/2013 4 check-ins Listed in Pup Friendly Places, Life is like a cup of coffee There are lots of coffee shops that also serve decent coffee, bagels and local taps. The Buzz Mill however stands out in several ways. They had 4 people working on a busy Sunday afternoon. All were friendly and working with a purpose. So despite a constant flow of customers there was practically no wait. I liked the lumberjack theme and found the mason jar lights pretty unique. I am not sure what it is like here other days days of the week but it was family friendly when I went. Kids and adults a like were enjoying pancakes from Blue OX and they have a table with modern day link and logs to keep the kids busy. The outside is also dog friendly and apparently tea cup pig friendly. There is a cinder block fire pit with wooden benches for those chilly nights.  I ordered a cold brewed coffee black and it is amongst the best ones I have had. No bitter after taste and served up in a pint glass. They sell kits to make your own cold brewed coffee too. I was also pleased they serve Topo Chico to wash down the BBQ and Bloody Mary I had later. Speaking of the Bloody Mary they run $4 for house vodka and $5 for the habanero infused. Warning, the habanero infused is not for pussies. Admittedly I did half house and half infused. It was pretty spicy and didn't require many ingredients from the bloody Mary bar to make it tasty.  Oh and an extra star for staying open 24/7 and smelling like fresh saw dust...I love that smell. Make your own bloody with habanero infused vodka and a side of Topo Chico ", pos 
The Buzz Mill ," 8/6/2015 I moved to Austin from Portland in November 2013 and was happy to find the Buzzmill. One of my first experiences was going there on Thanksgiving. I have no family in the area, but they made me feel like family with the best free Thanksgiving dinner. The theme of the place is logging, which actually happened at one time in Portland, but it's funny to see in Austin. I think the owner of the Buzzmill is from Portland and owns a few places there. The Buzzmill is open 24 hours and does have a happy hour for good cheap microbrew drafts. There is also coffee and hard alcohol, but no food, other than coffee shop type food. There are a couple food carts out back, including a decent BBQ place called the Blue Ox. They have a great backyard area and there are events there: standup comedy shows, bands, and more. People who aren't ""hip"" might call the Buzzmill elitist, but I don't think this is true. The Buzzmill attracts a young hip crowd, but that's because it's a cool place to hang out! So don't be a hater. Just enjoy it. Unless you're a conservative Republican type, but there are a lot of other places you could hang out at.  There's free wifi and a sort of separate room with electrical outlets for all the tables if you need a private place to study or write. It can get crowded and hard to find a spot at certain times though. ", pos 
The Buzz Mill ," 2/10/2013 4 check-ins There I was, minding my own business trying to find a cool bar for the WAKA dodgeball crew to hang out at after our ducking, dodging, and diving!! I saw the Buzz Mill in all its glory. I thought, ""Mr. Smidgens needs a coffee!!"".  I found a parking spot in front and strolled on in. There was Mitchell and the coffee/full bar in all their glory!!!! Shut your face!!! No, really!! Coffee, beer, and liquor!!! Woooooooooo!!!!!  Mr. Smidgens felt right at home with his new facial hair. I ordered up a chai and almond milk on ice and breathed in the Buzz Mill. As I looked around I saw that there were a few other of my favorite Yelpers hanging outside in the sunny courtyard.  We caught up on all the skinny and decided to order some BBQ from Chase and his Blue Ox trailer. I decided to go a half pound of lean brisket and a quarter pound of pulled pork. With free pickles and a delightful bbq sauce I was ready to give my taste buds a treat!!  I tried the brisket and it was flavorful but not mind blowing. With the sauce it was quite delicious though. Now the pulled pork did things to my taste buds that would make Keri B blush!! I loved it!! I washed it all down with a Topo Chico mineral water.  After one of the blonde beauties I was hanging with left we took the show inside. This is when I decided to get the vanilla latte that they use their own house made vanilla syrup in! I decided to get an extra shot of espresso, but I was informed they come in two. So, two shots deep I went for two more. It was the most mind blowing vanilla latte I have ever had the pleasure of drinking and enjoying for the rest of the day!! That 3 miles I ran seemed to fly by! Woooooooo!!!  The atmosphere is awesome sauce, the libations are the best around, and the food is nommolicious!!  Come one come all to the Buzz Mill / Blue Ox!! Buzz is open 24/7 and Blue Ox is Open Thursday to Sunday until they run out!! ", pos 
The Buzz Mill ," 4/24/2014 2 check-ins Unlike other self-billed ""versatile"" establishments, The Buzz Mill actually is able to pull off its many facets without destroying the experience.  The Buzz Mill is a 24/7 coffee shop/lounge/bar with food trucks. Whoa, really? All of those? Any one of those things could be a successful, self-sustaining business in this town. But Buzz Mill does them all, and does them all well.  The secret to The Buzz Mill's success? Probably its spaciousness. It's not a huge place, but each one of its three sections has the right size and feel. The sections are the outdoors, the indoors, and a long, thin room.  The outdoor section is The Buzz Mill's largest and most social section. It has a two food trucks, a stage with some benches, plenty of tables and seating, and even games to play (big jenga and skeeball--you know that one game you always played to get tickets at Chuckee Cheese's). You won't feel crowded outdoors--even on the weekend nights, which is when they have live music and things get a little hoppin'. The Buzz Mill is not a typical bar scene on the weekend, though--it's a lot more chill; it's a place you would go with your friends to get a drink and chill. It's not a place to dance or to get cray-z.  The indoors is a lot more intimate, and it's a little less social. Some people study inside and some people chat. They have a long bar with a surprising amount of variety. They have a ton of different coffee drinks and a ton of different alcoholic drinks. Their specialty is infused-liquor drinks. They have a ton of interesting combinations that will pique your curiosity.  They also have this long, thin room that seemed a little secluded. I got the impression this was a kind of dedicated study spot. People come with their laptops and books to study here; presumably they're trying to get work done. Even though it has a bustling social scene not more than a few feet away, you wouldn't have a problem feeling comfortable enough to get work done here.  The Buzz Mill is a place for all seasons. Highly recommend. ", pos 
Once Over Coffee Bar ," 10/4/2016 1 check-in Good coffee, pastries, and plenty of seating!

The bathrooms are nice and large, and even have full-body mirrors! It isn't too loud or crowded on a normal day so no complaints there. There is also a good amount of outlets for your devices.  The espresso here was surprisingly good; I haven't heard or seen much about Once Over so I had low expectations and was pleasantly surprised! I also tried a muffin - the carrot bran, and it was very tasty.  Overall a good study spot, especially if you want a place without the distractions of having perfect aesthetics or fancy seating or service.

It was quiet, people were talking some, a few people were reading.  I usually have my kids, and I would not bring them in here, it's much more of a grown up place - you may be thinking, well duh you asshole, it's a coffee place - but some places are ok to bring a kid to, I would not put this place on this list, but for when I escape from them, I'd come here :-) ", pos 
Once Over Coffee Bar ," 7/11/2016 Such a perfect no-frills, get sh*t done kind of place.

The interior was dark and this day they had excellent music taste. I easily passed a few hours there without realizing where the time had gone.  There are so many things to appreciate about Once Over that it is just so necessary to for me to list them off to you: CASH discount on top of reasonable prices Wild Gift coffee and Rockstar Bagels at a fair price Dope patio overlooking the creek if that is your scene They let bring in your own food Sassy baristas that tell you to leave if you're just trying to hop on the wifi without making a purchase (makes for a good show)  I highly recommend Once Over for all your coffee needs.

They seemed to enjoy their job and each other which is always refreshing vs the standard coffee house grind.  I grabbed a iced chai to combat the heat that Texas forgot to get rid of. It was spicy as a good chai should be.  They have some small amount of seating inside of the cafe, a few table options out front but the back deck is where it is at. If you sit with your back to the cafe you can watch the slowly babbling water stream of Bouldin Creek that rolls behind the deck in the wooded area. It was relaxing and comforting.

They were a little on the sweet side, but should go well with spicy tacos. The guys behind the counter were nice and quick, so no complaints. If you're in the area looking for coffee, this is a great choice, especially on a beautiful day. ", pos

Once Over Coffee Bar ," 1/16/2015 Updated review 2 check-ins I've been here several more times since my last review and the experiences have been less than satisfactory. The biggest thing for me is the staff - they just aren't friendly. The feel of the place is ""I hate my job. Can I help whose next?"" Additionally, there is often long waits and the staff doesn't seem to move faster to get things going or even aware of the mound of customers waiting.  Today I went in with my sister to grab drinks and food on the way to the airport. The person working was putting cream cheese on a bagel, but there were no other customers present. He took our order, slowly prepared it, and never made eye contact with us once. When I got to the car, my chai latte was cold! I'm sorry but if you can't give me a hot drink, there's plenty of other coffee shops that I can go to. Don't waste your time here. ", neutral 
Once Over Coffee Bar ," 1/23/2014 3 check-ins Cute spot with a nice laid back feel. We were warmly greeted as soon as we walked in by two lovely baristas. I ordered the cappuccino and my friend the latte, all were nice and strong. Once Over offers a peaceful place to study and a beautiful patio area to chill with your friends. I felt very welcomed here and will return if I'm in the area.  One thing that I found annoying was the parking notice on their door, a certain portion is supposed to be blocked off for the business next door and encouraged street parking. I parked there anyways, the business they are referring to appeared vacant. They should definitely consider marked parking spots so that a nice coffee goer doesn't get towed...not all people read notes. Cappuccino...so good! Latte Pumpkin treats ", pos

The baristas know the regulars there and it feels like a bar type setting. I was kind of jealous and wanting to be part of the gang! I still need to compare the taste to my favorite coffee, Houndstooth to see if it is a tie, or a happy second, but it wins in regards to the relaxing environment out back. It is also a fun place to people watch and listen to all the conversations if you are there with your laptop. The baristas are nice enough; not as friendly as Houndstooth or some of my other coffee stops, but I totally love the way they know their locals. I think this is one of the best places to go for a date or with a friend on a cool Autumn or Spring day and sit out back. Another plus; plenty of outlets for the laptop. ", pos

The coffee & espresso beverages are ok & nothing special. They are located in a spot that seems to be surrounded by a fierce competition of coffeehouses & other restaurants Their patio is nice & has a ""garden"" feel to it. Inside, the seating is ample & has large bar where you can sit & watch the barrista's in action. In addition to coffee, they do offer some pastry's & a small bottled beer/wine list if you're not in the mood for caffeine. They also sell coffee beans from local roasters. Both the hipsters who run the show & the hipsters who frequent Once Over are friendly & there seems to be alot of regulars who know each other. Lots of positive vibes. Parking would be my biggest complaint as it's very limited, but if you live in the immediate area it'll be a quick walk anyway. Coffee, hipsters, cold weather. ", neutral 
Once Over Coffee Bar ," 11/10/2014 1 check-in Listed in The Woes of ""MEH"", 78704 Adventures I found this coffee shop to be quite charming. There are many coffee shops in this area and this one happened to be right across the street from where we had breakfast. We found parking easily, though I'd imagine the parking situation could be tricky, best to walk or bike here if you live in the area.  I tried to check the website in advance to see if they offered the elusive iced chai, but the website appears to be just a cover page really. There were 2 baristas working their magic and they did have an ice chai latte. SUCCESS! They also offer a variety of beers and the signs says all beers are $3. I'd imagine their treats change often, but when we were there they had 3 different kinds of gluten free options (muffin, pumpkin bread and a brownie I believe). The inside was bigger than I thought and wrapped around the corner. They had seating in the front facing the parking lot and also a very cute patio in the back overlooking a creek. I liked the atmosphere as it was very laid back and the baristas appeared to know many of the clientele ordering drinks. While I did not enjoy my iced latte and found it to be overpriced (maybe I got the wrong thing), he did love his iced chai latte and I thought his was pretty good as well. I would be back if I were in the area, and I would definitely get espresso next time as it appears that may be thing to get here. ", neutral 
Once Over Coffee Bar ," 8/10/2014 You don't go to Once Over for the service. This is not a feel-good coffee shop where baristas offer meaningless over-the-counter compliments to cover up the fact that you're about to consume black tar water infused with caffeine.  Depending on which camp you're in, you're stepping deep behind enemy lines when you walk inside. There's hipsters almost everywhere - snapping photos on their vintage Hasselblad's and pondering Nietzsche. There's a bizarre blend of post-rock, twee and dub reggae espousing in the background. You'll probably wait a while before getting acknowledged...and you might feel inclined to automatically apologize when they ask you what you want.  This place serves amazing coffee, espresso and cappuccinos 100% on their terms. If you want a crew that actually knows and cares about the craft of brewing or the specific flavor profiles of various coffee beans - look no further. In many ways, Once Over is the counter culture of Austin. It's where quality surpasses experience (you New Yorkers will appreciate this).  Personally, I love this place. I visit here about four days a week because I know what I'm getting every time: damn. good. coffee.  I also love the baristas - they really are quite lovely once you show your face a few times. And if you ever get the chance, chat with the owner Rob. He's taken a stab at coffeepreneurship in California and North Carolina before realizing Austin is the perfect home for Once Over.  Tip: don't look like you work for the man and you'll easily strike a great conversation with one of their baristas or patrons. ", pos

Once Over Coffee Bar ," 5/10/2014 Listed in Austin: Future Visits Guaranteed, Austin: Coffeeshop Adventures There are two types of ""Austin-y:"" the made-up cute (e.g. Vintage Heart Coffee) and the grungy weird (e.g. Bennu). Once Over falls somewhere between the two, probably closer to the grungy side. Good ambiance for chill work time. It's a small place, but there are a good number of small tables that line the wall. My friend and I sat at one of these, right under a, er, lovely painting of a naked lady. Awkward start to the morning? Check.  My thoughts: Chai latte - Very light flavor, almost tasted like drinking hot milk. Glad that it was still pretty creamy tasting and not watery like other crappy chais I've had, also wasn't overloaded with milk foam. Not a fan though--would stick to espresso drinks next time. Cappuccino - Yummy! Would get again. I was able to ask for it with one shot rather than two. Apricot and white chocolate scone - Yum!

Honestly, take a look at their t-shirts on the wall. I picked up the purple one - soft, comfy, deep-plunge V, it doesn't scream the establishment's name and I'll honestly end up wearing it a lot and get the satisfaction that purchases like these really support local business.  I haven't explored their menu fully, but I will have plenty of time to do that. While the South First stretch between Oltorf and Riverside is the breakfast leg of my morning commute, I still have a few more places to visit... but I really think this may be my regular spot on the way to work.  First time I came in here they had $3.00 beer advertised... not as a special. I could be wrong about that - Wrote it in a tip. Regardless, I like the little back patio as it offers a starkly different view and atmosphere from the front - foliage, soft glowy lights. I really look forward to having a casual drink out here one evening.  So I'm a really big fan of this place and I hope they let me come back if I promise not to actually bite the baristas.

I'd hate to run the risk of running into an aquantaince in such a small space. Selfish? Yes. But I want this place all to myself. And only share it with the oddballs that frequent here.  I didn't always feel this way about Once Over. It's a bit odd at first, but you have to trust their methods. They know what they're doing. They take your order like a bar does. Drink first, then payment. It may be confusing the first time, but the emphasis is on the coffee, the service, and the experience of getting a perfect cup of coffee.  Also, I suggest ordering your coffee ""for here"" instead of ""to go""- it's an entirely different experience.The latte takes on a much deeper flavor in the porcelain cups. Slow down and enjoy the people around you. Talk to the regulars. There's a lot of them. And ask the owners about coffee beans. It's no accident the stuff tastes amazing.

Expect to stand awkwardly at the register while your barista snubs you before heading over with a lukewarm greeting.  Overall: Holding product, ambience and service equal, there are better coffee shops in the vicinity (i.e. 7th Flag down the street).

French-press coffee is a big attraction, though making it beforehand defeats the purpose. But a wide range of beers for $3 (not happy-hour prices, but all-the-time prices) and some pretty swell jazz playing on the hi-fi make for fine spot to while away the afternoon hours.

The atmosphere is a great place for a date as it has a very cozy and intimate vibe. They also gave a good amount of marshmallows for the two of us. The smores were good- however, nothing too special, just the average roast it yourself by the fire with chocolate and graham crackers. Because it was generic, the price could be a bit lower for this treat on the menu (we paid $7- the price of many entrees around Austin). I assume you are paying for the experience. My cravings were, on the other hand, satisfied.  This place is great to visit occasionally- especially late at night because they offer lots of alcoholic drinks, coffee, and snacks. Fast wifi was also a plus here for us. ", pos 
Halcyon ," 9/18/2016 1 check-in Heard good things about Halcyon, so I was glad I was able to stop in for some coffee one morning last week. The Thai iced coffee caught my eye so I ordered it. It was delicious! Very rich flavor and extremely satisfying, especially on a scorching hot day. I only wish Halcyon were closer to me so that I could have the Thai iced coffee whenever I want. The coffee shop also has an interesting, and very comfortable, atmosphere.  Taste | 5 Atmosphere | 4 Presentation | 3 Service | 3 OVERALL | 4.5 ", pos 
Halcyon ," 11/6/2016 Out for my own personal coffee tour of downtown ATX (recently moved to the neighborhood) and up next was Halcyon.  Stopped in about 1000am on Saturday.  Short line but plenty of tables available.  Two people working the counter so patiently waited my turn.  Female behind the counter was pretty surly.  She was taking orders, serving at the counter, so chalk it up to maybe just a busy morning.  When it was my turn no eye contact just a ""what do you want to order"".  Okay.. there for the coffee not to make a new friend.  Ordered a coconut milk latte, paid, tipped, and walked over to wait.    The latte was perfection and the guy making it smiled and told me to enjoy.  Went outside and sat at the railing to drink my coffee and enjoy the city morning noise  Lots of people watching.  Didn't order food but they had the typical ATX breakfast menu.  Have to say the coffee warrants another trip back to give it another shot and also keep the review from being a 2 star.  With all the choices for coffee in the area, good coffee is helped by friendly service.  Just a tip. ", neutral 
Halcyon ," 9/6/2016 Updated review 4 check-ins So, I popped out of the relationship I was in when I first wrote my review. And since that delegation have been back to Halcyon numerous times.  Pleased to report that my love of this place was not tainted by the rose colored glasses of my former relationship.  Yes, seating here is going to suck. It's hit or miss when you come in. But on nights where you need to stay up late cranking in work and in order to not fall asleep doing so---you need commotion, possibly a loud band and a decent hustle and bustle around you----Halcyon is the right place. I love that you can roast marshmallows here. I love during the right season there's like 10 different spiked hot chocolates to choose from, and I love that you have your choice of coffee or spirits.  Love this place. The employees are awesome, the bathrooms are clean, and just remember....be aggressive when you see a seat free up! ", pos 
Halcyon ," 5/17/2016 1 check-in Nice bright, modern bar and cafe located in downtown Austin.  I came for breakfast and ordered the Overnight French Toast with a Cappuccino. I was a bit confused that despite being ""eat in"" my cappuccino was made as to-go. But it was alright. The french toast isn't your traditional french toast, it's actually pretty dense...more like a bread pudding construction. But it was still very good, I actually enjoyed the more dense, cakey texture.  All in all, it was a good breakfast. There's no rush on the tables and the atmosphere is just fun and lively! French toast Panoramic ", pos 
Halcyon ," 4/12/2016 1 check-in The food here was delicious. They have a beautiful selection and the location is open and comfortable. I arrived for breakfast and got a cream cheese bagel with salmon! Yum! The coffee was A-OK and... Jeez... What a beautiful selection of drinks and food. Such variety! This is a great place to come during your morning work routine, or for a date, or for a reunion with an old friend! Yay!  Why didn't I give it five stars!? They were filming a movie! And, no, it wasn't cool. It was bothersome and it seemed to make the service... Less attentive. I know this may seem like a grumpy review, like, darn you kids and your fancy Polaroid cameras!!! But it really was annoying. The cashier wasn't the most polite guy. I didn't know you were supposed to order up front first (you order up front first!). And he kinda treated me like I was an idiot. It was not welcoming... It was more like, ""oh you DON'T come here all the time?! Well allow me to make you feel like a lesser person."" Yuck. If I wanted judgment I'd go to Burger King and order a pizza. Filming a movie! Set in a restaurant?! I bet it's thrilling!!! (Sarcasm) Yum!!!!!! ", pos 
Halcyon ," 7/11/2016 2 check-ins Halcyon is like that sweet spot coffee joint, you know?  Like you have to go when you're in the area even if you don't want coffee at the time.  And if you don't want coffee you can have adult beverages, (there's a nice long bar), buy cigarettes ( I don't smoke but they have a huge wall of packs) buy cigars, (they have a humidor room!!!)and even delicious desserts. Like the smores- which is a must, they give you a little gas flame thing and you can melt your own marshmallows. Great Austin-y joint if you want to take your out of town friends...great place to chat and even to work. inside and outside seating. Parking is...well, whatever you can find! Vanilla latte Humidor room. ", pos 
Halcyon ," 11/5/2016 I have tried Halcyon a few times and have consistently had a good experience. The s'mores (what they are known for) are fun but a little overpriced for what you get. During my most recent stop here, the graham crackers were slightly stale. I also wish the marshmallows were a little bigger!  Now for the good. This place has an incredibly mellow/relaxing vibe. It is great for people watching or just stopping in for a drink/coffee. I have not tried their alcoholic drinks, but their coffee is delicious! The customer service here is solid, and it usually isn't too crowded to find seating. ", pos

Halcyon ," 1/10/2016 1 check-in Love the coffee and vibe!  On this occasion...  My coffee took like 20-30 minutes though (we came before the rush too, no one when we got there) When I asked about it at the 17 minute mark after the 3 people with me got their drink the girl said, ""oh I didn't see it"" then took another 10 minutes to get my drink! Didn't exactly apologize or make it right away. Soy latte with cute little animal crackers ", neutral 
Halcyon ," 11/6/2016 1 check-in Came for some Sunday s'mores and coffee. I got the Guatemala pour over which was strong, and delicious. Nice seating areas. There were lots of younger couples/students here. Not a problem, just an observation. The s'mores were a fun experience. Definitely worth bringing a friend here if they are visiting to have a cup of coffee and a catch up chat before going about your day. 4 stars though because other chocolate options would have been appreciated. I know Hershey's are original, but the choice would have been nice. ", pos 
Halcyon ," 4/21/2016 Pretty neat spot for late night coffee/beer/dessert downtown. I came on a Monday night and they were still hopping in the late night at around 11pm. It was world music night and about 10 different people came to jam out on an array of different instruments, playing music from India, the Middle East, Spain, etc. Everyone together. They were great and people in the audience started dancing. Totally unexpected and totally an element of why Austin is so amazing to create spaces for this to happen and in such unexpected places.  Had a great time. Nice folks at the bar. ", pos 
Halcyon ," 6/9/2016 This spot is literally perfection - smack dab in otherwise dirty downtown. A modern interior with tons of intimate couch seating, or traditional bar type seating if you prefer. This place is the perfect pitstop. We arrived here on Friday night and ordered drinks and 'smores. I love the coffee meets dessert meets drinks aspect here, it's refreshing compared to the rest of the dirty 6.  The only thing that's a bit gross is the fact that their restaurant is open to the public and we saw the most random people walk in and use their bathroom which kinda marred the vibe a bit.  Otherwise, I love everything about this place - I'm sure it makes for the perfect daytime brunch and coffee spot as well! A must-visit if you're in Austin! ", pos 
Halcyon ," 9/10/2015 1 check-in Vibe is chill. Bartender is cool but for the price of the drinks I expected more with a lot better flavor and more diverse choices.  Bee's Knees wasn't on the menu but was made for me anyway. Okay. Bartender added quite a bit of gin which of course is pretty dry so even the honey couldn't sweeten it up by much.  Lemon Rhubarb was basically just sparkling lemon with a touch of alcohol. Where was my rhubarb? They looked oh, so very pretty but looks were kind of deceiving.  Thin mint is good but the person I was with that indulged in it said it sickened them after just a few slurps.  Hot chocolate was pretty bitter and really just could have used more sugar. It's hot chocolate, my friends. I'm trying to indulge, not be healthy!  Pretty cool that they have a cigarette bar inside to make purchases from and I love the idea of a coffee shop, food, and a bar combined but I'll stick with just getting the food and non alcoholic beverages (skipping the hot chocolate) next time I'm in here. Hot chocolate - not the best I've had but not horrible. Thin Mint. Chocolate rim with a mint alcoholic milkshake. Good but way too sweet after the first few drinks. Bee's Knees- off the menu; honey, lemon, gin. See all photos from Hannah H. for Halcyon ", neutral 
Halcyon ," 3/9/2016 1 check-in What a cute place!  I heard so many good things about their s'mores, and I was in such a s'mores kick so I had to try it out.  I can't say it worked perfectly, and made my marshmallows nice and crisp and gooey on the inside, but It tasted fine!    Their coffee is also very delicious.  I love Austin coffee anyways.  Their beans are so aromatically wonderful.  Great place to go to with a group, or even alone! ", pos 
Halcyon , 11/9/2016 Great place - definitely hand pour coffee - if you don't like black you must try this one black no sugar no creamer etc. was a fun chic place to hang out at. , pos 
Halcyon ," 3/28/2016 1 check-in A friend recommended that I try Halcyon while I was in Austin and I'm so glad I did! My barista was actually from the same town I am, which was absolutely insane to me because it's over 500 miles away! This coffee shop is in a great location and not too far from anything! I ordered an iced latte and my husband got a chocolate frappe and both were excellent! Halcyon has a full bar, so you can add a shot to any drink you purchase. The ambience is awesome, and there is a ton of comfy seating. Their art is mostly from local artists and right now they have huge glitter paintings of celebrities and I almost emptied out my savings account for one of them, but you can't exactly fit a 40x50 canvas in a carry-on bag.

Halcyon ," 2/2/2016 Listed in Austin Coffeshop Bucket List This is my go to when I am late night raving on 4th.  It can be a bit packed, the baristas a bit pretentious, and the wait time a bit too long...but you are in downtown ATX, kiddo and you gotta learn that this is the norm somewhere so it might as well be where they have ""DIY s'mores"" and killer Thai Iced Tea (w/a shot of espresso, it is DIVINE!) and is one of the better ""after all the bars close"" people watching perches! ", pos 
Halcyon ," 2/2/2016 1 check-in A date night place if I've ever seen one before. It had a distinct hipster-y vibe and it's probably a place you'd expect to see in Austin. The guy we were getting advice from at Berry Austin suggested that we come here for ""the best hot chocolate and s'mores in town"". Since we were pretty much done with alcohol at this point, we stopped in for a bit.  It's pretty cute and I think the s'mores are a unique and excellent idea. Basically they bring a lighter, light it for you, and you roast your s'mores over a little fire. Yum! I haven't had s'mores in a long time. There's only enough for about two of them a piece, so make sure you savor every bite!  I ordered the peanut butter hot chocolate. I thought it was okay, but the peanut butter was being overruled by the chocolate and the hot temperature from the drink. Note to self: peanut butter in a hot drink doesn't seem to mix very well with its contents. I tried scooping the peanut butter out with my straw and almost gagged on the remnants of the peanut butter. Bleghh.  Well, that minor detail aside, I would recommend taking your bae here and showing her how manly you are by not starting your marshmellow on fire. ", pos 
Halcyon , 9/18/2016 1 check-in Very nice a clean setup. Food was very good for a light breakfast. The French toast was just as good as mother made. Great morning breakfast in Texas. , pos 
Halcyon ," 1/22/2016 Halcyon is a really nice place if you're looking for an edgier place to chill with some friends on a late night for coffee or dessert.  It's most known for the smore's - they give you a small fire, graham crackers, chocolate, and marshmallows to roast yourself right there in the cafe. I'm not a huge fan of smore's, and it is a  bit pricey here, but I do like the environment here, and the fact that it's open quite late.  The chocolate cake is really decadent, so if that's what you like, I recommend trying it! I haven't had much of their other food, but they offer a lot of snacks. Unfortunately, they don't serve food after around 11 PM, I believe.  For people just visiting Austin, I think there are better places to get dessert, coffee, and alcohol, so Halcyon isn't one of my favorite places to go. But if you're already downtown, or live in Austin, definitely check it out. ", pos

What really makes Halcyon great though is their wonderful staff. Just a great bunch of people that are super friendly and make everyone feel welcome. Caffeine junkies should ask for the Quad Latte. Also, the breakfast tacos are fantastic. Excellent place to day drink as well for those so inclined.  Great place for tourists to get their bearings on a visit since you're in the warehouse district and close to Congress and Sixth. My personal favorite of the many downtown coffee shops. ", pos

Halcyon ," 11/5/2015 3 check-ins The Good: This place is pretty consistent in everything it offers. Good coffee, vibe, people, service, etc. It's not you're usual coffee shop. On any given night you can find live music, smoke hookah or roast some marshmallows and make s'mores.  The Bad: as in most dt locations if you're looking for a work-place or a stop-and-go coffee this is not a easy place to stop at, unless you live downtown. Parking around this area is not easy, but not impossible. ", pos 
Halcyon ," 11/3/2015 I've only been to Halcyon a few times in the company of friends who knew some of the bartenders/baristas. Based on those experiences, service and the price of our cocktails was quite reasonable. Absurdly reasonable.  Nepotism aside, I really enjoy the environment at Halcyon and the enormous selection of drinks they offer. It's hard to beat sitting outside on a pleasant fall day and people watching. I've never gotten the S'Mores before, but it definitely looks like quite a fun thing to do and would be perfect for a date. ", pos

Halcyon ," 5/22/2015 1 check-in Hipster coffee house, spirits and smokes. Had to check it out.  We had lunch here and went the boring route of just getting PG versions of the coffee. Although the espresso martini was tempting me.  The soy latte was very nice. My husband had the pour over coffee which was very good!  For lunch, I had the walnut apple salad. It was the perfect size and very nice. My husband had the Elvis - a PBJ with bacon, banana and honey. They classify this as a ""snack"", but it certainly can be had for lunch. He would have licked his plate if I allowed him.  Halcyon is a cool place with a cool vibe - quintessential ""Austin"". I need to come back and try one of these espresso drinks. A soy vanilla latte The apple walnut salad - very yummy! See all photos from Suann G. for Halcyon ", pos 
Halcyon ," 10/8/2016 This place was good, but not great. The positive was the location, they had a lot of seating and the outdoor seating is great for watching people and traffic. I ordered the turkey Brie sandwhich. The salad was good, the greens were very fresh. The sandwich was good...but not great. I am a huge Brie fan and I couldn't even taste it. But for a lunch sandwich, it was good. Make sure you have time to wait though, it was about 20 minutes!!!! The place was extremely busy starting around noon.

Halcyon ," 10/12/2015 PERFECT DATE PLACE!  This is my go-to place for a date and I definitely recommend. We always order the s'mores and it is so much fun. They bring you the s'mores kit which is the marshmallows, hershey bars, and graham crackers and a mini fire stove so you can roast your own marshmallows! The atmosphere is super chill. I've been when they've had a live musician. It isn't too loud which is good because you can actually talk to who you're with. They have couches and tables and tallboys. It's across from all the gay bars and next door to Cedar Street Courtyard which are both fun spots to check out after you enjoy your s'mores. ", pos 
Halcyon , 8/24/2015 Not sure why I made such a big mistake by not ordering the s'mores but I think I need to come back and try it.  Came here to meet up with a friend on a Saturday afternoon and it was decently packed but nothing to crazy.  I ordered the Iced Latte and sat down for a couple hours to do some work.  The wifi was nothing to crazy but it did the job.  The overall environment in Halcyon was really nice.  Not too loud but not library silent.  I would highly recommend this place for a ice quite place to work or talk to some friends. , pos

Whether it's during the day or at night post-club/post-bar, this place never disappoints.  The s'mores and drinks are amazing here. I highly recommend you try the espresso martini - one of my favorite alcoholic drinks in Austin! I've also had the Nutella crepe, which was absolutely delectable. I honestly don't think you could go wrong with many of the items on the menu here.  It may seem a little small here, but there's actually a plethora of seating options available. Of course if you come at night, especially during the weekend, it may be a tad difficult to find seating. Fortunately, there's also seating outdoors. S'mores and espresso martinis. ", pos 
Halcyon ," 10/2/2015 The wife and I stopped in late night after dinner. I needed a little caffeine before the drive back to our hotel. We stumbled upon Halcyon and it had a great vibe going on. We lucked out and got a little corner area to sit and take in all the action as we had a view of the whole place. Now this review is mainly for the cold brew coffee and the coconut tea that the wife got, as well as the service provided. All was excellent and we really enjoyed the relaxed atmosphere.  It seems like they have some type of s'mores dessert that was clearly popular as we saw it on more than a few tables. I'm sure that they have some other food options, but we really didn't take a look at the menu other than for coffees and teas. We would definitely return and hang out at Halcyon whenever we find ourselves in downtown Austin. ", pos

Iced coffee was a good - not too bitter, just the way I like it. We also got the Migas breakfast tacos with avocado cream. They were really good, but beware the red salsa - it is extremely spicy. Also enjoyed the overnight French toast. Service was friendly and the place was very quiet and peaceful on a Sunday morning. ", pos 
Halcyon ," 3/3/2015 1 check-in Listed in Pretending to Hook 'Em The way I would describe this place is a Michael Buble song laced with a couple shots of whiskey. All in all, I had a hard time deciding between 4 and 5 stars. Let's be conservative and stick with 4 for now.  AMBIENCE Ohmygosh so romantic!! Red-orange lighting, live music (modified string ensemble with drum and guitar), colorful bejeweled portraits of famous people on the walls (Audrey Hepburn, Lady Day, Snoop Dogg just to name a few), varied seating in and outdoors, stools and couches, and a bar! Very cozy and intimate.  FOOD & DRANK Did I say intimate? How about s'mores for 2? At your table? Honestly this is probably just a thing for first-timers to order but it is still a really adorable and creative concept. My cappuccino came in a giant cozy mug. My friend's latte came in a yellow one! The color was adorable! Milk foam on mine could have been stiffer but the overall taste of the drink was strong and smooth.  SERVICE The baristas were wonderful, fabulous, friendly, and so easy to talk to I honestly didn't know how to go about interacting with them LOL. They addressed me by name and all that jazz.  Overall, I highly recommend this place for even though it is busy, it still creates an intimate atmosphere for whoever you choose to come with. Open late into the night, conducive to deep talks and cute dates. A cafe, with a bit of spice from the bar. S'mores for three! With an americano and peppermint latte in the background ", pos 
Halcyon , 8/21/2015 I had the cosmonaut and it was pretty darn good! The vibe is chill and their music playlist was bomb(in a good way).

Halcyon ," 9/11/2015 OVERALL: great place for a quick bite for dessert on a date!  AMBIENCE: perfect little place to go for a date with mild lighting and couches for you to sit. These couches have very comfortable pillows to make you feel like you're in your own home. There are some corners with couches that give you a lot of privacy also. Sometimes have live music playing which is quaint but not overpowering of the night to where it's all you can hear.  TASTE: we had the smores for 2 people which was about $7. It was your basic Hershey's bar, marshmallows and graham crackers that you could put together from any supermarket but it comes with a small flame to make everything yourself which is cute to share :)  SERVICE: No really waitress, but pay at the counter and they bring it to you. They don't really check up on you until you are on your way out. Staff is nice though! Basic smores for 2 with moist towelettes for the mess! Date night with the private corner of pillows!

Tried a bit of the soy chai latte and typically I'm not a huge chai fan, but it was some tasty brew!  Didn't try the food, but plenty of people had drinks from the bar also on a Friday night.

They have eight different kinds of hot Toddy's!  Eight!  The Buttery Rum is absolutely delicious.  A friend ordered coffee with Bailey's and was happy as a clam.

Halcyon ," 5/18/2015 7 check-ins MUST TRY!! Absolutely adore the iced mocha. The iced vanilla latte was also good compared to other places I have tried. For both iced drinks it was $10.28 so it was a bit pricey, but I don't think that will deter me (my poor wallet lol). I didn't really investigate for stamp cards, but I will next time.  The inside was very cozy and had great Austin flare. A good amount of seating ranging from couches, to tables to little pillow bed-ish couches in the corners. I think it's a great place to study or come from brunch. They do have a food menu but the times which breakfast and such are served is limited. I came in for a waffle that I saw on yelp but I came in too late. Coffee barely lasted until the end of the review ", pos

I've had the infamous do it yourself smores and to be quite frank, I don't think it's great but it's definitely a fun activity for a group of people for a date night. The smores are for 2 or 4 people and it comes with skewers, marshmallows, Hershey bars, and graham crackers, so basically everything you can buy at the store for the same price.

Halcyon ," 1/7/2015 1 check-in The two things I ordered at Halcyon both involved chocolate.  1) S'mores This is an ingenious idea that I wish more coffee shops did. It was freezing (for Austin) standards and I had a lot of fun torching marshmallows (and watching my girlfriend light a few on fire) before squashing them in between some Graham crackers and chocolate. Love it.  2) Some sort of chocolate martini thing. I don't really know what it was because I was drunk, but it sure was yummy when I had it! You should be able to figure it out when you get there.  Really cool building interior, but definitely not enough seats for its location downtown. You seat yourself, and I think most people have enough sense to leave after they're done with their coffee or whatever they're having. There aren't many electrical outlets handy, so that certainly helps keep the stereotypical buy-one-coffee-and-stay-all-day-on-your-laptop customers away.  I highly recommend it as a good meet up spot and date location! The bar ", pos

Halcyon ," 1/29/2016 2 check-ins This place rocks!  I'm from Chicago with a Starbucks on every corner. I love visiting independently owned coffee houses. But most don't have such an awesome food menu. On a short trip to get out of the cold weather, I stopped here twice. Customer service is beyond expectational!  Both times, I asked if menu items could be tweaked or combined to reflect my low-carb way of eating. Not only did they help me figure out the best meal, the food was awesome and beyond what I anticipated!  And most importantly they didn't act like I was putting them out. It has a great porch, clean restrooms and the ambience is really nice!  The coffee is delicious too! Specially made salad. ", pos

Halcyon ," 2/5/2016 1 check-in It's a nice little place, but with Austin hipster attitude.  Sparse seating and retro kitsch decor greet you upon entry, and there's an odd cigarette shop in the corner. Service is what you would expect, but the coffee experience was not as expected.  Plenty of coffee shops take their brew seriously, but none of that is apparent at Halcyon.  It's a nice place to sit and have a breakfast pastry, but skip the coffee and get it somewhere else.

Halcyon ," 8/6/2015 This is a great breakfast place! I got a Lox bagel and a Thai iced coffee, and they were both delicious. The bagel came out unassembled, and I am always a little confused when a breakfast sandwich comes out like this. I really liked this one though. The presentation with the lox was really pretty, and it made it seem like I was having a really fancy breakfast at this low key joint. The sandwich itself tasted really fresh even for this New England girl. The coffee packed just the right punch of caffeine, coffee flavor, and sweetness. I had initially asked for a French Press (apparently I only like country based coffee beverages), and they don't actually offer that anymore. Since I ordered that and couldn't get it, the barista actually took $4 off of my bill. So my coffee was almost free! I didn't expect it, and it definitely got my morning off to a good start.  The actual place has a cool vibe with exposed beams and brick walls, local artists work for sale on the walls, brightly colored accents everywhere, and classic bluesy tunes playing in the background. They have great places for working, but they also have cozy places to curl up with a book or even hang with friends. They also have a full bar for the evenings, and I can only imagine this place heats up at night. The baristas are super friendly and helpful (see above), and the wifi is free! As a business traveler, it was nice to get on quickly without having to login or see any ads. This was definitely a plus.  I would definitely recommend this place to travelers, and I hope it's a hit with the locals too! Lox bagel and Thai iced coffee. ", pos 
Halcyon ," 7/2/2014 1 check-in Popped into Halcyon 10:30pm on a Wednesday evening and the place was packed but we managed to find a nice seat. The employee taking our order wasn't pleasant and had a very fast paced attitude. We went with the s'mores for two, a mudslide, and a cappuccino.  The cappuccino was excellent and went perfectly with our s'more feast and my friend's mudslide was tasty but after one sip I was ready to take on 6th street! The s'mores were a blast, we had fun shaking off the flames from the mallows and acting normal when they went flying onto nearby hipster messenger bags/or backs(tee hee). Use caution with those flames!  They had this dreamboat guy singing indie music, he had such a wonderful voice, we clapped with all our hearts after each tune and we received death stares from people reading their books...sheesh!  FUN FUN times at Halcyon! S'more fun! ", pos 
Halcyon ," 11/14/2015 Three of my favorite things in life: coffee, cocktails, and dessert. Great location too. Visited a few times so far, first time had lunch, other times had drinks, coffee, and s'mores on the last date. Only comes with one or two servings so would have been down for a double order. Because of the night time buzz people seem very social even in the day time for a cafe when you want to just be working with wifi. Not the silent-whisper to your friend kind of cafe. Good times.

Halcyon ," 7/2/2016 1 check-in Good place for coffee. Espresso was a bit watered down, though their La Marzocco machine is nice and I suspect it was just a poorly dialed in shot (but they obliged to give me a pull of a single origin).

Halcyon ," 4/16/2015 Updated review 2 check-ins Went here one night with my little sis to catch up since I moved to Houston, and what a great place to do so! We had both ordered an alcoholic drink that was somehow mixed with coffee (Irish coffee?) feeling a little adventurous and the cool and totally hipster s'mores snack/meal/thing. The s'mores came with I believe about four items of each of the essential components for s'mores, but at one point of the night, we underestimated how much cracker to use and had to ask for extra crackers. The cashier up front simply smiled and gave us a couple more with no charge, which was pretty nice of him since a line had begun to form outside of the building. The atmosphere is really chill. A nice cafe to go to when you don't wanna be dealing with 6th street drunkards. I do gotta say though claim your seats swiftly and quickly! Dem seats are in demand. ", pos 
Halcyon , 5/25/2015 Not as good as I remembered. We ordered Carmel hot cocoa and a peanut butter hot chocolate. Added baileys to each but just wasn't like I remembered the last time I was here.  I do recommend the smores. They are fun on a late night and so yummy!  The place is always packed even late with a very fun and eclectic crowd. We made a special stop since its one of my Austin favorites. It just didn't meet my expectations this time. , neutral 
Halcyon ," 9/23/2015 1 check-in A very relaxing cool atmosphere. My bestfriend who visits Austin often comes here during the day to get coffee and do her art. She loves this place and told us to come by!  I ordered what my friend usually gets which is a hazelnut frappaccino. It was so delicious not too sweet and had so much flavor! It is a bit on the really creamy side especially when you're down to the bottom of the frap it gets really foamy but eh, I don't mind that!  I love the atmosphere of this place, everyone seems to be to themselves but very friendly. A great place to study not too loud and pretty relaxing music.

Halcyon ," 5/20/2015 I love chocolate. I also love ice cream. And tea. And hot chocolate. Obviously, I love s'mores.    I am not a huge fan of alcohol. So a place that can combine the two successfully is so appealing to me. Either way, Halcyon is a FANTASTIC place to go to for just regular hot chocolate. Seriously, they have 4 different types of hot chocolate. Heavily on the chocolate (French Hot Chocolate), so delicious.. The other hot chocolate type that I tried is the Bittersweet caramel. I really love caramel, and it's this is a little salty and just fantastic.  Of course I'm going to talk about the s'mores. The s'mores are great -- they give you a little fire and you can melt the marshmellows and it's like you're at camp again! Except you're inside, there's no mosquitos and you're surrounded by comfy pillows.  If you are looking for a sweet intimate date -- Halcyon is the best place I can think about. The seating is sectioned off, there's pillows everywhere... ", pos 
Halcyon ," 9/14/2014 1 check-in I've been here multiple times, and I normally would give it five stars, except that parking is always insane, because this is on the corner of such a busy area!  Their food is great, and the drinks to me are just okay. What makes this place so cool is the atmosphere and the type of people that frequent here. You get a mix of your normal coffee drinkers with those that like to drink and have a good time, and you get a great mix of people all at once.    The service is always very attentive to your needs. Yesterday, I ordered a Thai tea, and I saw one, and thought it was mine so I took it.  The kind bartender told me that it was actually someone's previous drink that they forgot to pick up, but he gave me the option of getting a new one. And when they ran out of the Thai tea, he offered me a special drink which happened to be a very tasteful iced chai tea latte.  So, I always give special props and good reviews to those that have great service! The menu ", pos 
Halcyon ," 5/28/2015 If you have time to spare, Halcyon is a great spot to start off or finish your night downtown. Love the location and the fact that it's clearly marked and visible. The iced latte I had was fine, but nothing special. However, the green tea frappe was spectacular! Chocolate peanut butter frappe was nice without feeling too heavy.The hibiscus tea is good too, if you don't mind paying almost $3 for iced tea.  I agree that the s'mores are probably a first-timer gimmick, but they're so fun. And so cute. And such a perfect date idea. Service can be pretty-to-really slow, so go if you have time to spare and hang around. Note that the designated coffee pick up area is not clearly marked and is practically at the bar, which is confusing.  The pomegranate margarita was fine - strong enough, but nothing I'd come back for. Mainly, I bought it to try out the bar/coffeeshop environment.  Atmosphere is cool - almost too cool. The couches add a cozy feel and I like when there's a good amount of people in there. Overall a fun spot to stop if you're downtown! ", neutral

Halcyon ," 1/7/2016 6 check-ins Used to come here frequently in the summer to read and hang out while waiting for my bf to get off of work downtown. Definitely a cool place to chill if you can find the space. Seating is pretty limited and the place is normally filled with other people working. (which is probably a good sign otherwise) Always a lot of cool art on the walls. I normally would order the hazelnut frappe but have tried the different iced teas, thai iced tea and have gotten a salmon salad that was one of their specials and have tried other things off their menu. Food is always pretty good and the prices are reasonable. I have yet to try drinks from the bar but in terms of my other drinks I've had slightly sloppy drinks made here and really really good ones depending on the barista. Tipping definitely will go a long way here.. ", pos

My office had a taste test with various vendors in downtown and Halcyon won, hands down.  As an added bonus, everyone at Halcyon is friendly and goes out of their way to make sure I'm happy. Mari and Jules are especially great and always greet me with a smile, making me feel like I'm entering into a friend's kitchen.  If I could give more than five stars, I would! ", pos 
Halcyon ," 2/9/2015 Guys, I'm not gonna lie, I've hated on Halcyon for a while. It was kinda that place  where you'd go freshman and sophomore year of college when you wanted to go downtown, but couldn't actually go downtown (pre-21 lyfe). The first time I ever went, we celebrated a friend's birthday with the s'mores everyone is obsessed with. But you know, after doing s'mores the real way and having a real campfire, or even a gas stove for that matter, a small lantern ain't that impressive. Sorry, Halcyon.  Then, when a friend visited me junior year, we went to Halcyon, because even though I wasn't a fan of the s'mores, I do like me some coffee. Sadly, the coffee drinks were pretty sub-par and when Patika is a couple of blocks away, I'd rather opt for the real stuff. I remember we both got cafe au lait's and they were pretty meh - more milk than coffee and not even good coffee. I was really trying, Halcyon. At least you're still cute.  But apparently, it took me moving half way across the country for me to find Halcyon's sweet spot: cocktails. A friend I was visiting in Austin is obsessed with Halcyon. Seriously, OBSESSED. Thankfully, she admitted that the s'mores are unimpressive and the coffee isn't great, so I had renewed faith when she told me that the cocktails/beer/wine are pretty stellar. And she was damn right. Two cocktails almost took me to outer space (shout out to Dwight, the awesome bartender, and his awesome NASA cap). We had 4 cocktails in total, and naturally, I can only remember the name of one (Pine & Pear) - but ALL of them were amazing! You've redeemed yourself, Halcyon. ", pos

Halcyon ," 7/14/2014 1 check-in This shop is definitely not as good as the one in San Antonio but it'll do the trick.  Located downtown, this Halcyon is a lot smaller than the one in Southtown (SAT) but it does have more eclectic seating. The crowd looks quite the same; mostly early 20-something, more than likely college students.  The drinks are about the same although I found their chai to be a bit on the spicy side (not heat spicy just chai spicy). My wife just ordered tea so had they messed that up, well, things would have gotten nasty.  The one downer was the woman taking our order - the one with all the facial accoutrements that would make it impossible to pass through airport security. She was a bit on the sour-disposition side of things to say the least. I mean, when someone thanks you for something, how hard is it to say, ""you're welcome,"" or even just a ""no problem?""  One thing I noticed about this place is that they have make-them-yourself smores. You get a tray with a cast iron hibachi, a stack of graham crackers, 2 bars of Hershey's chocolates, marshmallows, and skewers. Too cool. Now maybe the Halcyon is Southtown has this but I've never seen nor asked. Unfortunately, my wife was not interested in making smores. Bummer!  Two other quick notes to pass along... Yes, they do have outdoor seating and yes, free WiFi. The latter is slower than a Lada heading down M58 in January. ", neutral 
TOMS ," 11/21/2016 1 check-in I don't know where to begin in describing this place.  All I know is that I want something similar in LA. The closest spots I can think of right now are The Alcove in Los Feliz for the outside seating and Marie Et Cie in Valley Village for having the unique set-up of selling something else on top of the food and drinks.  Austin has a big passion for outdoor seating, this place takes the cake on having the biggest outdoor area for being a coffee shop. Although the space is huge, there are only a few seats available so you can still get some privacy away from the other patrons.  Just like a lot of the restos/cafes in Austin, their building is a very old house, when you walk, the floors creak. But it has a very rustic charm. It's like your grandma's house, full of charm and you'd feel the comfort and warmth brought by the whole ambiance.  Before going in, we didn't know that this is also a shoe and eyeglass store so imagine our surprise when we saw the other wing of the house full of shoes and eyewear display. It was the coolest thing!  My favorite part of this place was the 2 front porch wooden swings. It was like summer vacation from school all over again. Oh, and the coffee was good, too. huge outdoor area such a cute cafe where they also sell shoes/boots ", pos 
TOMS ," 12/1/2016 I really like the rustic charm of this coffee shop. It was warm and cozy on the inside, but the backyard was equally inviting, so we chose to have our coffee there instead.

They sell shoes and glasses in addition to coffee, and all the merchandise is buy one, give one - just like TOMS anywhere.  The coffee is pretty good, but $4 for a black drip coffee seems a bit extreme. But hey, it helps get water to underdeveloped countries!  Wifi works really well, but  I can see the lack of work tables being a problem. There's lots of outside seating, though!  Will it be my go-to work spot? Probably not.  But I'll most definitely be back here regularly. ", pos 
TOMS ," 6/25/2016 1 check-in Half shoe store, half coffee shop. Tom's roasting room is a pretty sweet place. They have a bunch of sustainably sourced and organic coffee beans which they use to make all your basic coffee drinks. I got a drip coffee made from Guatemalan beans which was pretty good, not spectacular - but then again it's a shoe store.    The place has a pretty chill beach-club-house vibe with lot's of wood, rope, and unfinished looking materials. It's a nice place, and they're constantly reminding you that everything you buy is helping out people across the world, which is cool I guess if you're into morals and all that. Drip coffee.

TOMS ," 6/14/2016 Updated review Sapped for caffeine at 4pm on S Congress, I want a mom and pop but I can't venture too far from where I started so I end up at Tom's.   It's what you'd expect: coffee inside a hipster shoe store where sunglasses are also sold. The cold brew is standard and it seems the prices are, too.  Almond milk and fancy coffees are available, but the fancy coffees are made with syrup instead of natural flavoring which is disappointing.   There's ample seating inside and out. Cute patio tables out front make great people watching spots, and a large interior workspace is ideal for laptop work. ", neutral 
TOMS ," 2/14/2016 Super cute spot!  I don't think this is a place I will come when I am craving a good coffee. The vanilla latte was a bit too sweet, and no coffee flavor lingered at all - a minus in my book. The regular latte was decent and good quality, but didn't blow me away.  I will say, however, that this shop is very unique - there is a small arrangement of TOMS sunglasses and shoes you can purchase in addition to the espresso bar, and plenty of seating inside and out. The outdoor seating is a carriage house out back with a giant chalkboard to decorate.  I love the personality this place has - there are numerous decorations and unique seating and murals all over the place - seriously, endless picture options, and I love their philanthropic approach to their business.  I think TOMS is a good location for hanging out with friends or grabbing a drink before wandering around South Congress, or even a place to bring your kids. They also show movies if I am not mistaken.

My friend, Michelle, loves TOMS and I'm a hipster, so obviously, we had to swing by this TOMS coffeehouse during our recent visit to Austin. I was looking up teahouses in the area and had to do a double take when I saw TOMS on the list of search results, but yes, it's true: it's TOMS, the shoes company! They roast their own beans and sell them by the pound, as well as in the form of handcrafted beverages you can enjoy while perusing the store. There are a few tables inside the cozy coffeehouse (literally, it looks like someone's house), as well as a few outdoor picnic tables in the back. It's a great place to catch up with friends and/or to do some work.  Unfortunately, the coffee is not that great. It's not terrible, but I'm spoiled and my iced americano had too much acidity and not enough flavor. The store is cute, although small-ish. They have one small room dedicated to (women's, men's and children's) shoes and another room dedicated to accessories (bags and sunglasses).  Trés adorable, trés hipster.

And every backpack you purchase goes towards supporting a birthing kit to aide in safe births around the world. So of course, I had to purchase multiples of everything! Love this place!

TOMS ," 5/4/2015 1 check-in The day I came here the espresso was phenomenal!  I want to go back just for the espresso.  I wish my coffee trader friend was here to try it.  The quality of the roasted beans was top notch, well balanced, not bitter, creamy and smooth.  It's been awhile since I have had an espresso that just blew me away.  Plus, you get to support water projects while purchasing the coffee, so you feel good also about helping out others.    It's fitting that this is called Toms Roasting Company as it is primarily a coffee community hangout spot.  They do have some food options, they serve Tacodeli daily, and have some baked items (the gluten free chocolate macaroon was delicious).  I would go here just to chill.  All the seating spaces here are great: a porch swing, cozy spacious back room, and a large outdoor patio with all types of cozy cushioned seating spaces (that offer great so co people watching views).  They also offer some great community events each month here (join the mailing list for the event deets).    The retail space for the shoes, bags, and eyeglasses is cramped in a small area.  There is little room to view and try on shoes with the amount of people jammed into the same spot.  I didn't find it pleasant and felt the need to escape vs. purchase.

TOMS ," 5/23/2016 1 check-in Listed in Austin Coffee What an adorable little shop! I finally had the chance to visit and I enjoyed my time here. I ordered a cold brew and my friend got a latte, and we sipped on them while browsing through the many selections available in store. TOMS has really upgraded and become trendy over the years - a sharp contrast to the plain grey TOMS I've had in the past. The inside area was a bit small and very quiet, and the back area had a lot of light.The outside area is spacious and faces the street; I got to sit comfortably on one of their Acapulco chairs and enjoy the breezy weather that day. Overall, I enjoyed my visit and will be back next time I'm in SOCO! ", pos

TOMS , 10/6/2016 Really cute atmosphere. But the store clerk guy infantilized me which is a big pet peeve of mine. He called me sweetheart. Like he must've been 19 years old- you only call me sweetheart if you're eligible for AARP. , neutral

TOMS ," 8/21/2015 1 check-in Listed in Reviews of 2015, Shopping, Coffee Shops I'm not a coffee girl, but my feet love my TOMS. Who knew there was a TOMS coffee shop?! Thanks again to Yelp and my fellow Yelpers, I did.  I found myself downtown and in need of shoes. After researching the area, there is practically a shortage of stores of any kind. But I'm glad that I discovered this one. It was about a two mile walk down Congress, in the opposite direction of the Capitol. It really wasn't a bad walk at all. On the way back, once my feet were treated, I stopped in at a few on the shops along the way.  The two staff that assisted me were extremely helpful and kind, not too overly sale pitchy either. I wasn't sure which one I wanted to buy, but they were patient. I ended up going with the lacy TOMS. I was afraid that the lace like material would rub my heels, but he assured me that they give or stretch a little and they did. They basically molded to my feet. I absolutely love them... they were worth every penny. Dear God, I hope you weren't reading this review looking for a coffee recommendation.  They had a water station and I even had the barista fill my cup with ice. She was just as kind as the shoe sales team. I'm not sure why Jo's, across the street had such a long line and TOMS was basically dead. The atmosphere was way cooler here, they even have a hammock! ", pos 
TOMS ," 8/16/2015 1 check-in I am in love with this store. I want it's interior, including the shoes and apparel, to be my house.  Pros: -Located in the heart of SoCo, right next to the famous Homeslice and across Hopdoddys! -the new shoe designs are HOT. They really upped their game! -new bags are pretty sweet, and purchasing one will benefit a new charity to sponsor women and their newborns -I don't care if the ""fad"" of helping shoeless children has faded for people, or if the ulterior motive for the owners could possibly be just making money; their effort to help children around the world is noble and amazing. -The coffee shop inside, also by Toms, is pretty awesome. Percentage of sales go towards providing clean water in (so far) three countries -this is the hottest place to study or hang out. There's great lighting from the neat looking wall/windows. There are seats inside and outside with Mexican blankets hanging off the sides. -play ping pong under a sea of garden lights during your study break! -or sit by the sleek, golden fireplace while reading their beautifully designed catalog -or lay in one their hammocks outside while sipping on their cold brew. You might as well buy one of their sunglasses if you need a pair! -or do it all!  Cons: Nothing bad to say here! ", pos 
TOMS , 1/18/2016 1 check-in I met the girlfriend here after I ordered some pizza down the street. What can I say... This place is unbelievable! I have never heard of it before but all you need to know is they GIVE as you buy! They offer many different things from coffee to sunglasses to shoes. Best part is that depending on which one you get they give back to people in need! I bought the girl a nice ring and shoe purchased some boots that she loves.

TOMS ," 7/19/2014 4 check-ins This may be my new favorite place on SoCo to stop for a coffee and take some time to relax (sorry Jo's I still love you as well but you don't have the nice outdoor seating that Toms has).    The storefront is a converted older home with a coffee bar in the front to the right, and to the left is a retail front for sunglasses/eye glasses and shoes.  The employees are very friendly and helpful.  If you can't locate the shoe you want, they will look online for you and give you a free shipping code.    The iced coffee was delicious and I will order it again.  Toms will be great for year round visiting as they have ample outdoor seating- porch swings, hammocks and benches all around the property.  Inside there is a fireplace which I'm looking forward to sitting by in the winter.  And how can you go wrong with a knit-bombed tree?  You can't. Nice hammock in the back and the knit-bombed tree.

TOMS ," 1/11/2015 Very cool coffee house.  This place is one strange bird indeed -  being a fusion coffee house, eyeglasses store, shoe store and charity donation stop  with a heavy emphasis on Save the Planet! Fair Trade For All!.  The buzz is if you are in this building you are saving the world, and you probably are an artist, a philosopher and an activist too.  Hey, flattery will get you everywhere - and I ain't exempt.  The coffee is legitimately superb. (Beautfiully bitter and with very creative and interesting mixed coffee drinks. The menu is not Starbucks redux yada yada yada. They got new things to drink.)  The decorating is superlative.  (Worn wood plank tables, brass brazier with an open flame for cold weather, chalkboard maps of locations in the global south where they are making a difference etc.)  The crowd is one of the coolest of any I have seen in an Austin coffee house - and that is a formidable statement given who is sitting next to you in the top tier of Austin coffee establishments.  Are you really saving the world if you drink their coffee?  Probably not as much as you would be if you wrote a $1000 check to Oxfam, or you were working to build ecotourism, or you were fighting the good fight opposing international land grabs.  But pennies count - and the pennies here go to a good cause.  And the food and the ambience and the crowd are totally seductive.  Count me in. ", pos 
TOMS ," 3/13/2015 1 check-in Prior to my trip to Austin last week, I didn't realize that Toms had its own standalone stores, let alone a cafe.  The store and cafe are located in a beautiful old home, and they did a great job transforming the space but retaining a rustic vibe. Obviously the store featured Toms products, and it was nice to try on some of the sunglasses in person as I had previously only seen them online. All of the employees we encountered were friendly, and two of them get bonus points in my book for discussing their love of Broad City.  After browsing the shoes and sunglasses, we stopped by the cafe side to pick up a drink. Having already had coffee that day, I went with the Honey Mint Palmer, which was listed on the board as a house specialty drink. I chose to have it made with black tea (the other option was blueberry). The drink was refreshing and delicious, although $5 is a little steep for an Arnold Palmer with some honey and mint.  There were a lot of people camped out and reading/working/etc. in the seating area so it seems like this must be a popular place. When we initially walked by, I assumed that it might be corny or targeted towards tourists, but it really does feel like an independent shop (that just happens to sell Toms apparel).  Overall not bad, but not amazing. We definitely had better experiences at some of the other local coffee places. ", neutral 
TOMS ," 12/3/2014 3 check-ins I do own a pair of Toms sunglasses, but I didn't buy it because I thought I was saving a kid in some poor country. For me, I prefer donating directly to the nonprofit organizations of my choice.  I was very hesitant about getting coffee here. What does a shoe company know about coffee? Well I was wrong. I had one of the best cafe au lait in recent memory here this past weekend. My husband's Malawi pourover was also excellent. The barista was friendly and I like the casual, open environment.  Go ahead, grab a cup of coffee, sit on the lawn and enjoy the people watching. ", pos 
TOMS ," 7/26/2015 TOMS has a plan to take over the world, but they are doing so whilst running coffee shops and dishing out shoes to third world countries.  My evidence for their ambitions to pull off a lifelong desire of Pinky and the Brain? They own a coffee shop on South Congress, post-2009 housing crash. With Austin real estate skyrocketing, this philanthropic coffee shop snatched up a prime location. They now sling out their own beans in assorted beverages--alongside TacoDeli tacos of course (another company aptly prepared to run shop on corporate Austin).  The coffee quality is decent, the space eclectic, and the service good. For anyone who desires a funky shop, deeply rooted on a feel-good foundation, this shop fulfills those itches. ", pos 
TOMS ," 11/24/2014 1 check-in Love this shoe shop/coffee shop.... really interesting/unique space with a small coffee bar, but large seating area, both indoor and out. It's an awesome converted house that embodies the TOMS brand completely.  I had the vanilla coriander latte, which sounded a bit odd, but tasted delicious. The coffee was smooth and super tasty, and I'd come back in here any time, just for a cup.They had some unique concoctions like the maple cardamom espresso (it was not for me but my partner enjoyed it a lot) as well as the good old-fashioned latte menu. I would absolutely recommend their coffee - I was hesitant when I first saw it at my local whole foods, since, you know, they make shoes... but it's a good cup.    We came this time for coffee AND shoes, and though they had good stuff (we walked away with three pairs), the selection was a little smaller than I was expecting. If you have a specific pair in mind, it would likely be better to order online. Huge selection of sunglasses and frames, though.  Tom's has the SoCo vibe down, so if you're shopping on congress, this a great place to stop and take a break - particularly to enjoy their outdoor seating on nice weather days. They also have juices and a small selection of food from greencart if you're wanting to grab a quick bite. ", pos 
TOMS , 3/16/2016 What a great coffee shop! The sitting area is fun  and dog friendly.  The service was exceptional and the coffee was delicious.  It was definitely made with care.  If you buy a bag of beans you are supporting a town with water for a week.  We really liked supporting a cause like this one. It's a great spot and we wished we could have hung out here longer. , pos 
TOMS , 9/14/2015 I really enjoyed my tasty iced vanilla coriander latte. There was a generous dollop of vanilla and it was just sweetened right. I love the atmosphere- cozy inside and out with a lovely swing outside. If I lived here I might study here or chill. Wall with countries helped , pos

TOMS ," 10/27/2014 Yes! This place is so cute and pretty much exactly what I expected. I had a meeting for work and breezed by the line snaking around the corner at the ""I love you so much"" establishment down the street, parked for free, grabbed my coffee, and hopped onto their wifi.  It was perfect weather outside and we sat out there, since there weren't any open tables inside. However, I would've preferred to have sat at a regular table, as I had a meeting sitting on a bench with the person I was with sitting on a tiny wooden chair made out of wood branches.It was pretty humorous, but not ideal.

I'm not a huge fan of their lattes, but I enjoyed my ice coffee. I asked them to add hemp milk to it and they said it was not a problem.

TOMS ," 5/4/2014 2 check-ins At first, I thought this Toms store opened just for SXSW. But I guess it's a permanent space. The layout is half retail store and half a coffee house. Are they trying to get coffee drinkers to buy Tom shoes and sunglasses or vice versa? I don't know. It look really nice in the inside where it seems they kept some of the layout of the house. They also have a nice patio and yard for people to relax with their coffee. They also sell Organic Juices from a self serve fridge. Out on the front porch, there are a couple of swings where you can sit down and people watch. I had a cold brewed coffee which is pretty good. Food for thought. Chimney for the cold nights.

TOMS ," 7/27/2014 In my never-ending quest to visit Austin's coffee shops, I headed over to Toms this morning. I could tell just walking up to their cute little storefront house that I was going to enjoy this one. They have a decent amount of outdoor seating between the front and back, two porch swings (my personal favorite), and a few hammocks, too.  Inside, they showcase their products (shoes, sunglasses, journals) in one area of the house. It's a fun spot to peruse. Very well set up and quite a few of what I assume are their newer products.  In the back room there's a cozy seating area. A few benches and tables, as well as cushioned seats. They also offer a container of cucumber water, which is a nice touch.  Now to the coffee part: I got the cappuccino. A small comes with two shots and a large with four. Their cups are small so that's a great coffee/milk ratio, in my opinion. I hadn't heard of their coffee beans, but it was a nice flavor. The baristas were pretty friendly and they made a beautiful heart for my latte art. Gotta love the latte art!  All in all, this coffee shop has a great vibe. I highly recommend it if you're looking for a place to catch up with a friend, or just relax. I haven't been to Jo's yet, but Toms doesn't have a ridiculously long line, has better seating, and it's just up the street. I'll be back! ", pos

They offer a selection of pastries and breakfast tacos, and have non-coffee options such as Kosmic Kombucha and Daily Greens. Yay!  Toms is a nice place to sit down and read a book for an hour or two, or even get a little work done. They also have a lot of cool events going on each month, like free yoga and other fitness events!

TOMS ," 3/17/2014 1 check-in Apparently I came on the right weekend because this place hasn't even been opened for a week! The place still smells like new! (No lie)  So here's the nitty gritty: I ordered the mocha coffee and the Chai tea for a friend. Both were surprisingly very good! Initially I wanted something off of the specialty menu, but alas... everything was already sold out! (Keep in mind it was Sunday afternoon) south by southwest must have sucked this place dry! The mocha coffee was kind of sweet, but I felt like it had the right mixture of mocha and coffee which didn't make the coffee overwhelming sweet nor bitter -- but just right. The Chai tea was surprisingly very good!! It wasn't thick and it wasn't too sweet either!  The interior is very welcoming and I can definitely see myself coming back the next time I visit Austin!

TOMS ," 6/9/2014 1 check-in Listed in Keep it Weird ""We're in business to help improve lives.""    No you're in business to make a profit, I'm starting to see now that helping people is a great way to help suckers like me feel better about our consumerism.  Last time I checked you're NOT a NPO... You're still about that bottom line. Don't get won over by that quote on the wall while you walk around.  I own about six pairs of these shoes. I always loved the idea of buy one, the company gives a pair.  And I am a sucker for comfort.  I draw the line on my addiction after visiting this retail hybrid coffee shop.  The coffee is decent (and super friendly, and attractive baristas might I add). There are glasses, sunglasses, and a very small retail area.  The stand out to me was the $20 Ethiopian scarf. For some reason the idea that particular item struck me. Who was this Ethiopian that constructed it?  What's their story?  How much of a cut did Tom's get?  Does an Ethiopian receive a scarf once I purchase it?  All these questions started swirling around the scarf as I sipped my cold brew.  Then I looked around and saw the place swarming with employees... Dang. That's included in the price of my shoe. Or are they donating their time just like Tom's is donating a pair of shoes for each pair you purchase?  Anyway, at the end of the day.  This is another company making money using an incredible tactic - one that is altruistic.  Yayyy capitalism!! But I think after visiting this store they've really started pumping up the ""improving lives"" bit to sell consumer goods that may be inflated since well, people will pay for it (exhibit a: myself).  But after reading the reviews on the poor customer service when the products go south shortly after purchase, no thanks.  I'll keep on washing my Tom's.  Maybe be back for some cold brew but I think I'll pass on any new eyewear or kicks in the future. ", neutral

TOMS , 9/24/2014 Love this place INSIDE and OUT! The Vanilla Coriander Iced Latte is a must try!!! And of course have it with almond milk! Great place to have a nice sit down/relax and people watch.... read a book/catch up on emails from work or just simply sit on the front porch on the swing chair like I did! , pos 
TOMS ," 11/10/2014 I love the relaxed and (surprisingly for S Congress) peaceful tranquility at Toms. I is beautiful, the coffee is good and I am hoping the fireplaces will be blazing this winter. My one complaint is that the wifi sucks big time. It is very flaky and has an annoying logon which requires my email address. Most of the time I must tether my phone to get online because Toms wifi is not working. This is apparently a known problem as the staff are unsurprising - yet it persists. I even called the tech support to try and sort things out with no joy. chillaxed ", neutral 
TOMS , 7/30/2014 1 check-in I love the environment both inside and outside of TOMS! I also like how it is a coffee shop and a shoe/glasses store of their products. From what I saw it looked like they have every Toms shoe there is in their store. They also have a wide selection of glasses/sunglasses.    I ordered a Chai Latte and it was pretty good and had a strong kick to it from the spice. I got it cold since it was super hot outside. I also tried some of my friend's capuccino and it was very strong! Free water is also provided for anyone. The water tasted delicious with the lemons they have floating in it.    The seating area was nice and cozy. Typical coffee shop set up to me. You would think they don't have any restrooms when they actually do because the restrooms doors are practically camouflaged with the walls! Outside of the shop there are hammocks and chairs so that you can enjoy your coffee while enjoying the weather. , pos 
TOMS ," 10/8/2014 Do you enjoy coffee on your porch swing, patio, or hammock? Well if you're visiting Austin you don't have to leave that behind. This is probably an upgrade to what you have at home anyway. And you can do some shoe shopping while you're at it!  This house is decked out with plenty of outdoor seating. You can people watch from the coffee table along South Congress or the two 3-person porch swings. There is also plenty of seating in the backyard, along with a couple hammocks.  The coffee is on point. I recommend starting your day off here before you head anywhere else for breakfast. ", pos

TOMS ," 6/5/2014 I had to stop by here this morning on my way to work to see what it was all about.  PROS: -Open at 6 a.m. -Giving Jo's down the street some much-needed competition -Good iced coffee with alt milk selection -Mild sense of charity when purchasing a drink, which the barista tells me will buy one day of water for a person in Africa (?) -They serve tacos from Fresa's! -Shoes, eyewear and a little lounge space, plus an outdoor firepit, makes me think that could be a cute spot to visit after work  CONS: -Fuzzy explanation of charitable work - maybe the baristas need better training on this point -$3.50 for 16oz -Slightly corny Tom's ethos prevalent throughout the space - fair trade, trying too hard vibes ", pos 
TOMS ," 2/7/2015 So the concept for this coffee shop is as wholesome as any other Tom product and serves as a vehicle for bringing funds and awareness to really important social impact endeavors. The vibe and set up of the spot is well done, clean & showcases all Tom's products along side some locally made products. Community yoga, tastings & movie showings round out the place, and adds a lot of value to this already busy street. The coffee is also damn good! Bravo! ", pos 
TOMS ," 8/22/2014 I can appreciate a place that encourages positivity and this is exactly it!! I was greeted across the street on Soco with ""You don't have to be great to start, but you have to start to be great""  Totally reminds me of that one episode of Portlandia when the home owners association purposely hires somebody to post encouraging messages on the window of the house to attract visitors and raise the value of the houses in that neighborhood xD  ANYWAY.  Regardless of their intention, it uplifted my mood that morning and made me walk in! After all, it is the first TOMS store I've ever seen!  So this house is nice and cozy. I didn't try their coffee since I already got my fix at Jo's. But their TOMS shoe selection seemed to have some special collections and they also had an eyewear collection. All of these products are a part of their buy one give one program. I also like how it is a full on coffee house. There's room to sit in the back and a backyard as well! I like how they put the seating in the back where you don't constantly have to be interrupted by shoppers- good thinking there. Oh btw, the seating area is incredibly cute with their uber comfy chairs.  I'll be back when I'm in Austin :) ", pos

The outdoor area in back looks really relaxing. It's a corporate business, but it's got a nice ""we tried to fit into the Austin vibe"" feel. Jo's down the street does it just as well, but this was a nice change. And next time I want Tom's shoes, I'd go here first. Enjoyed our drinks. ", pos 
TOMS ," 4/11/2014 1 check-in I am a fan of fair trade. I love that it is trendy and oh so prevalent in our world today. I adore so much of Austin because there is an emphasis on awareness of one's choices  with regards to diet and exercise and values. People matter. It is tremendously exciting to have a store in Austin specifically for TOMS. The store is smack dab in the middle of South Congress, and it is darling. Little wooden porch swings and an outside hearth greet visitors as they climb up the steps and enter the store. A coffee shop is on the right hand side. I selected the Peru blend for purchase as well as in the form of a cold latte. The cold brew was TASTY- get it! The store also has eyewear as well as shoes, which I shall browse on another day:). It is a gorgeous day in Austin, and it is time well spent to sip a cold cup while swinging on a porch swing at TOMS. Do it. ", pos

Close to my house and has a loyalty program for the people that just can't get enough.  Great service too.  I have been the first person to walk in the door before and I was greeted with nothing but smiles and warm welcomes.  This is my regular place now and have introduced quite a few of my friends to it too.  They all agree.... best in town. , pos 
Genuine Joe ," 11/6/2016 Room nice.  Plain coffee meh.  They have intriguing over-the-top mochas.  However, that is not the headline story here.  *  What is the headline story?  POPCORN!  POPCORN! POPCORN! POPCORN! POPCORN! POPCORN!  Not disgusting movie popcorn.  Real deal homemade style popcorn.  * I have just received a protest email from NANWWACH.  NANWWACH is the  National Association of Nerds Who Work At Coffee Houses.  I, personally, am a charter member.  NANWWACH says that popcorn is a terrible thing to have at a coffee house,  because popcorn done right is greasy, and the grease gets on your fingers  So if you are working on a computer the grease gets on your keyboard or on your mouse.  *  Dear NANWWACH.  I don't care.  Popcorn is simply a higher spiritual calling -  and is the greatest thing to have next to you while you are working.  Sincerely yours,  Samuel C.  * So bring napkins. Bring paper towels.  Hey, bring a whole carwash if you think that is what you will need.  Genuine Joe's has its charms.  And if you like your coffee concoctions sweeter and more elaborate than plain old black -  then you might get into the coffee as well. ", pos 
Genuine Joe ," 8/25/2016 1 check-in The artist group I belong to had a planning meeting here for the East Studio Tour.  They were busy and had a bunch of meetings that were planned already inside the three rooms so we sat on the patio out front.  There is plenty of parking behind this old house turned coffee shop.  It appears that to reserve a room you have to have it up on the board as we were told by a guy who was a little angry we walked into the room he had reserved.  I got the iced latte and it was served in a plastic cup like you would use at home.  The vibe is pretty cool here and my latte was good.  There wasn't anything truly notable that stood out about this place but, our time here was enjoyable all the same. ", pos 
Genuine Joe ," 6/9/2016 1 check-in I came here because it was the highest rated coffee shop near me at the time, and I'm very happy I did!  There's quite a bit of parking behind the seemingly-small coffee shop, so I parked behind the shop and walked in. The inside is colorful and full of character with a short but sweet menu above the register area. There were quite a few people there working or reading scattered across the mismatched couches and various tables and chairs.  After perusing the menu, I chose to go with an iced soy dirty chai tea latte because of the clever sign they had up (I don't exactly remember it, but I recall it played on the ""dirty"" part of the order). They charge an extra eighty cents for soy milk, which is the most I've ever had to pay for it, but it was alright because I really enjoyed my drink! It came in a long tall glass and was mixed well, although I would've hoped for a bit more of the chai flavor.  They have two other rooms besides the main one where you place your order, similarly decorated. There's a single-stall bathroom that was very clean, which I appreciated!  I'm happy I stopped by, I'd definitely come here agian! My adorable small iced soy dirty chai tea latte! ", pos

Genuine Joe ," 11/22/2015 Having been in recent need of somewhere to do some thinkin' and tea-drinkin', Joe gets the 4 stars. However, as I don't drink coffee anymore, this review may be a little misplaced. Again: I don't drink coffee. Theirs could be great. It could suck. I do not know. It smells pretty good. Mainly I drink tea and eat their gf/vegan stuff.  GJ is open a healthy chunk of the time. They have ok wifi. Their tea selection is ok. They will give you free hot water refills on your tea of choice. They've got 'all fruit' smoothies, sodas, water, some of the flavored syrups. They have a nice bunch of gf/vegan pastries, as well as some premade sandwiches and salads in a cold case. The barista service has always been cordial, if slow when the line gets busy. I don't blame 'em - if the mgmt knows they only need X baristas to sling my tea, I am not complaining.  The crowd at GJ is mellow, and the music (often of a song-driven nature) is usually at a respectable volume such that you can get work done here if working-at-coffee-shop is your thing. There are almost always people here toiling away on their notebook computers; the regulars here are beginning to look like barflys to me, except they stare into computer screens and eat biscotti instead of liquoring and staring at televisions. I did see one guy leave after a few hours and then come back and eat half a pizza in here the other day, so somebody respects their regulars.  In summer the a/c is adequate, cozy in the fall/winter. They have two meeting rooms where you can pay to have your group gather for a variety of things. The rooms, like the rest of the place, are fairly funky Austin / ramshackle decor, so when I say ""meeting rooms"", do not expect perfectly climate-controlled spaces with motorized drop down screens for your powerpoint presentations. Seating comfort is hit or miss, depending on the chair needs of your rear. There's a small patio out front by Anderson Lane without much shade. There are a couple of mini bars with barstools where you can change up your sitting or standing technique, if you are computing, and lucky enough to score one, which is nice.  Don't be misled by parking in front, where there's only 3 spaces + a handicapped space - you can park in the back lot. I've never been here when it was so full that I'd have to park on a side street, but you could probably do that if you needed to.... for now.  I thank you, GJ, for being my go-to coffee joint in the area. (Others may suggests Monkeynest, which does several of the consumable things better, has sorbet! and is open 24/7 - but their a/c is crap, they are often maxed out in seating due to the burgeoning population of the Burnetty area, and have live music 3-4 days a week, which I find is not so good for the concentrating). ", pos 
Genuine Joe ," 4/18/2016 Way laid back coffee shop with a subversive edge.  I was recommended this place by a gay friend, who said friends of his opened the place years ago and this was his favorite place to go when he lived in Austin. I didn't notice much in the way of gay pride though. This mostly just looks like a very lived-in, cozy coffee shop with worn and comfortable chairs.  The menu isn't huge, but the house coffee rotates and what I had (something from Guatemala) was flavorful. They have a few food items like muffins, breakfast tacos, and sandwiches. My cranberry muffin was a-okay.  Snarky notes here and there might be off-putting to some, while giving others a chuckle. The punk in me loves the huge sign in the parking lot facing their neighbors warning customers that ""our neighbors tow!"". The former business owner in me thinks, we there goes any business you might've gotten from them and their customers.  Loved the smooth bossa nova playing quietly in the background and the almost library-quiet pervading the place. It made an excellent spot to get some work done. It's not a big place, but there's a good amount of seating options and almost always an available electrical outlet. ", pos

They also have Casa Chapala breakfast tacos. I was very happy for that on a Saturday morning.  My mentor program was able to reserve the large room off to the side for a meeting, with min $25 purchase (for the whole group!). That was a steal of a deal.

The perfect fall beverage for those who don't always appreciate the pumpkin spice (although they have that as well) and it is great hot or cold. Although it is a popular establishment, they have ample parking in the back and the line moves quickly. Their coffee is a bit on the pricey side but I have found all my drinks to be worth it.

Genuine Joe ," 5/28/2016 Listed in Austin Cafes: Coffee vs Community or Both! This spot is situated at the edge of the  Crestview neighborhood, though there were as many cars in the lot as people, so I can't be sure that it's a local haunt, especially being off a major thoroughfare (Anderson Ln), and not at all friendly to walk-ups or bike commuters. When it got to the fifth minute of looking for a place to lock up, I almost left, feeling pretty awkward having explored the entire perimeter of the building before entering. There was no one on the patio, so I stealthily parked there, not that there's signage saying otherwise, but I did feel defensive, which is why I ended up sitting outside. I probably would have made this choice regardless, as it's eerily quiet inside despite the bold decor, and dim, but I liked the variety of seating options: couch, high table, low table, stool ponied up to the window...and a private room that can be reserved for meet ups. That's a special feature you won't find elsewhere. I knocked off a star because my drink was actually pretty bad, but the baristas were flustered from needing to make a bank run, so I helped them out by paying in exact change, and not mentioning that my latte required 2 sugars and cinnamon to taste like more than almond water. What redeemed the visit fully was that someone asked to join my table, it being the only dry one outside, which left the impression that the clientele feels really comfortable around each other, and with themselves, enough to talk to ""strangers!""

Of course anything near Sunrise, and Enchilada Y Mas is sure to get a ton of foot traffic.  Firstly, I'm a dirty heathen and don't actually drink coffee often. I LOVE my tea, though, and they have Guayaki Yerba Mate which is so good, along with two coolers of other goodies.  The decor to me works. It's inviting and feels comfy. I think Epoch has set a standard for stand alone coffee shops, and while this is similar in it's approach it's still unique enough to where it stands out to me. The music is always subtle but keeps up with the feel of the place, and never overwhelmingly loud to where it's distracting. I don't know how often the art is changed out but it's all local artists and is usually pretty badass! I don't know if they cater to a theme but it's always pretty cool.  The baristas are some of my favorite and combine the right amount of snark and sass. This obviously is personal preference but it feels right to me. I like some sass with my tea. Hah.  It's probably cause I'm from Austin but I appreciate the myriad of non-chain coffee spots. I feel like, again, Epoch set the standard, but all the one's I've been to seem to have their own self identifying features. If I ever dip into a Starbucks - I've probably got some invasion of the body snatchers going on with me.  Sass and Tea really, though. :) ", pos

There is even a sign stating that you shouldn't ask them to smile and I don't remember exactly what else it said, maybe something about being nice? No worries there the girl at the front took her time before she got up off her seat to wait on me, seem to have an attitude, and was dressed to show that she just doesn't care. I got one of their house special lattes. she gave it to me so hot that I haven't really had a chance to taste what the taste tastes like yet.

Genuine Joe ," 10/27/2013 19 check-ins Listed in I'm pretty much a coffee shop expert. This is a review that I should have written a long time ago.  I love this place.  The baristas here never seem to be having a bad day, and when they do, they kinda make fun of themselves about it.  I appreciate that from baristas, who, in my experience, ALWAYS HAVE DRAMA GOING ON THAT THEY WANT TO SHARE.  Not so here at Genuine Joes.  They have the best selection of snacks from vegan bakeries in town and I have NEVER had a bad coffee there.   The wifi is also always functioning at a decent speed and I really appreciate the warm atmosphere.

Genuine Joe ," 8/21/2014 Some places make you feel at home right when you walk in. Genuine Joe's did that to me. No one knows my name or my regular order, and the baristas are standard Austin baristas (too cool for school on the surface, actually cool and friendly underneath), but it's such a welcoming environment that I don't care.  I work down the street, and I make the trek over over once a week to read the latest edition of the Chronicle and drink some tea on the patio. Sometimes I choose from their vast selection of Buddha's Brew. Sometimes I try whatever loose tea they've made into an ice version. Sometimes I go crazy and get a chai.  I've never had their coffee because that ain't my jam, but their tea is always good. Baked goods from Russell's, so you know it's legit. No day-old discount basket for the stale ones, but they'll switch it out for a fresh one if you point it out. (Let's get with the times and offer day-olds, guys.)  Check yourself before you wreck yourself in the daycare parking spots. Who knew daycare parking could be so predatory? They'll tow your ass in a flash if you park on their side. ", pos 
Genuine Joe ," 5/14/2015 Plenty of open space to work, read, or just lounge around. Whether you prefer a table tucked away in a quiet corner or a big couch to lounge on, you'll find it here. The fact that I don't need to fight for a seat at Genuine Joe will keep me coming back.  I ordered a breve latte, and the foam wasn't as stiff as I prefer, but it was still a fine latte, so I won't hold it against the barista.  There's plenty of parking in the lot behind the store.

Genuine Joe ," 4/27/2015 I really like this place. Its got the run down coffee shop feel with a wide variety of old chairs and tables. You'll also find several armchairs and sofas to lounge on.  It isn't too crowded whenever I have gone  I really like studying here and there are plenty of outlets against the wall. The volume level is medium to high I would say but of course depends on the time and crowd. There are two rooms that can be reserved for groups at 15 bucks an hour in the form of purchases . When not reserved, people are welcomed to use the area. Because of the rooms there aren't many tables to choose from during busy hours.  I like the staff too. Josh is a good guy and told me about the dirty Chai, espresso and chai, which anyone that likes chai should try.  There is also a nice big parking lot. Be careful not to park in the designated spots for the business next door or your car might get towed.  Overall a good coffee shop in my book. ", pos 
Genuine Joe ," 11/9/2014 2 check-ins This is my third time here, and my friend's favorite place to get some works done. I was told it's usually quiet enough to get works done, and the coffee prices are fair enough for me to come here several times a week.  I like how the table lamp are set up on the bar and plenty of seating, both indoor and outdoor, for you to choose from. If you want even more personal space, there are two separate rooms for you to hide out.  I'm not giving five star because one In s while, you will get groups meet ups, and the rooms will not be available for you. Barstias are usually friendly, but just some happen I met one that's quiet loud for my expectations. In general, one of my favorite places to hang out and get some works done if I'm not in the office. ", pos

Fortunately for me they don't open before 7 a.m. so I can't come here before work, but since they are a mere few blocks from my house, I do plan on walking here on the weekends.  Very awesome indoors. Comfy and funky, someone said and  I will agree. Plenty of seating inside and out.  The staff was really friendly and quick. We had muffins and chai tea.  The pumpkin muffin was out of this world fresh and soft, full of pumpkin spices. The chai tasted like the icing of a cinnamon roll, though not quite that sweet, but in other words PERFECT. I like a strong, spicy chai!  Lots of vegan options. They have smoothies too. I'll be coming back and often! ", pos 
Genuine Joe ," 8/15/2014 Unfortunately for me, I no longer work near this coffee shop. When I did, I was there every morning preparing for the day with filthy chai.  Staff is awesome, super cool, easygoing and often freaking hilarious.  There's always a great mix of people in and out throughout the day.  I love to support this joint. Anytime I'm in the area and could use a double shot of esp, I swing by and stick for a bit.  Go there. Soy chai with three shots of espresso. Watch out people, I'm driving with this. ", pos

Vanilla lattes the three times I've been and they're good.  Not the best I've ever had, but they are yummy.  It's just a neat place with indoor and outdoor seating.

Genuine Joe ," 2/25/2015 Long overdue review. Two words: Best Chai in town! Seriously, the best I've found and I have tried lats and lats everywhere (native accent used for emphasis)....  Central Market makes a good one too but something about the Genuine Joe's version makes me really really happy. Oh, and no, it's not the sugar making me happy - I can't stand much sugar and honestly sometimes will dilute it a bit but it's good all the same. This Chai goes very well with Ben Harper, Franti, Imagine Dragons, OneRepublic, or even some Celtic or Reggae music.  Okay, besides the awesome Chai, the decor is neat too (think shaggy vintage) and they change up the mounted art work from time to time and have funky cool music playing. Staff is very diverse and not too hip to be courteous as you sometimes get in Austin. Make sure to check out the mini library too. I'll usually thumb through the Dinosaur or Global Geography book while waiting for my drink :-)  Nice joint! Will definitely recommend. ", pos

Genuine Joe ," 3/29/2014 I have to say that this coffee shop is not for everyone.  It's definitely quirky.  However, our group met in their meeting rooms for months, and they were so accepting of us and easy to work with.  Their meeting rooms are great; one of the best options we found for the price.  It is cool because your group members' food and beverages go towards the price of the room!  I loved their huge three way mocha...so fun!  I look back fondly on when our group met there! ", pos

Genuine Joe ," 7/22/2015 As I sit here, enjoying a dirty iced chai latte, it's hard to believe I've never reviewed Genuine Joe (GJ's as my family likes to call it) because I come here all the time. Maybe because I like the fact that it's a chill, non-pretentious place that I don't want to get over-popular. Alas, it has become quite popular, often standing-room only on the weekends. There's nothing particularly special or fancy about GJ's. They make good brewed coffee, espresso drinks, chai's and all the usual coffee shop drinks. They have a nice selection of pastries that I think comes from Russell's. At least, I know their cinnamon rolls come from Russell's because they're awesome. They have breakfast tacos that I think they get from Chapala, though that may have changed. They're fine, pretty fresh if you get them first thing in the morning. The staff are generally very friendly. GJ's is in an old house that is very casual and comfortable. They've put in more tables and chairs, I'm sure due to more people coming in with computers to work. They have plenty of parking. Just don't park at the day care that shares a lot with them because they tow. They have a couple of meeting room areas available for group reservations. GJs is just a nice, comfortable coffee house. My favorite in the area, for sure. ", pos

Getting here is kinda weird, as its tiny and hard to see. Great coffee and cappuccinos. Everyone has plenty of room for their laptops and it's pretty quiet unless it's open Mic Night. The parking is bigger, just behind the building. I give 4 stars just bc it's kind of hard to find and the constantly reserved rooms. ", pos 
Genuine Joe ," 1/21/2015 My book club meets here once a month in the front room, which is PERFECT for any kind of small-group meeting. My only (big) complaint is that they use a powdered mix for the chai tea, which means you can't get it without dairy...That's a huge no no, considering Austin has both a huge vegan community, and an abundance of coffee shops where you can get chai made from almond, soy, coconut, or even hemp milk. I usually end up with a brewed tea (made with tea bags, they don't do loose leaf) or just grabbing a Topo Chico from the refrigerated case. A HUGE plus for this place, is that they stock vegan goodies in the bakery case, which I'm happy to pay good money for.  The space is great for reading or working, they have a nice patio, and they have books or games to borrow, which is great. Plenty of parking in the back. ", pos 
Genuine Joe ," 5/28/2015 This place has been mine and my husband's saviour since we had a baby. Only a mile walk from our house, it's perfect to take the cranky newborn in the baby pack and get yourself some much needed refuel juice with as many shots of espresso as you can stomach. I love their tacos too but you gotta get there pretty early to get them usually. The local art they always showcase is awesome, right now it's G2cube and if you haven't seen his work around town you should definitely check it out!

Genuine Joe ," 6/4/2015 I really wanted to love this place because I've heard good things about it but we went for a work meeting - three people and it was hard to find good seating, and even harder to hear over the horrible spa music they had going. The girl at the counter when we walked in (myself and a colleague were the only ones in line) told us to wait while she say there at the counter griping on the phone about someone who didn't show up for work that day. Some guy that had been outside smoking when we walked in came and took our order and barely said three words to us. I ordered a large iced coffee for ""there"" and it was about as big as the ""tall"" at other coffee places for more money.

This a bit dark inside, the place is covered in quirky decorations. Half the place is working on laptops while the other half chat and read books. It smells like coffee when you walk in and the guy behind the counter happy chats with you as your order.  The fact that it's in between strip-mall-like shops on a busy 4-lane arterial route in Austin makes it all the more special. The coffee is good and locally roasted. The pastries look very good even though I haven't had one yet. While this whole package might only earn 4-stars in the downtown of a more coffee-centric city, further out in Austin this is an easy 5.

They rotate out artwork for sale from (local?) artists, everyone is friendly, and they have a couple of rooms (the Board Room and the Cellar) that you can rent out for meetings, or take over when they aren't reserved at will.

Don't come here to chat or collaborate unless you can get in the basement room.  I think their prices are a tad steep but I appreciate that they've got delicious diet coke. They're also very creative with their coffee drinks so if you're with a non-coffee drinker, they can usually still get behind a three layer mocha whipped whatnot.  The best part? People there are not posers. Yes, the 80s term but also, no ones trying to be cool to death with wild hair or major BO or big thick glasses reminiscent of buddy holly just because.

There's a few different rooms and an outdoor patio. The music isn't loud and overbearing. The environment is pretty laid back, and I'd feel comfortable coming here to meet with friends or to get some work done/keep to myself. I felt a little warm when I was here, but it could just be me.  The staff are pretty friendly. They'll carry on a conversation with you as they make your drink, but they aren't going to force anything with you either.They prefer you use card for purchases over $5, but I assume it's perfectly okay to use your card below that amount. GJ offers a 5% discount if you use cash.  The menu offers a diversity of drinks, and the beverages aren't expensive.

We found this spot after our coma meal at Torchy's Tacos up the street a bit and really needed a pick me up before the lake.  This location is so unassuming since it kinda is located in the middle of some random plazas which seem to have nothing to do with coffee or anything good ... and its essentially just a house. Once you park and walk in, you see the kitchen area with the coffee counter to order and some nice, worn in couches to relax on. They also have an outdoor area on nicer, less warm days where you can relax with your coffee.  The coolest part is that they have great roasts and they have a ""meeting room"" called the board room.

Genuine Joe ," 7/24/2013 3 check-ins Anderson might be a fairly large road that runs right past this small coffee shop, but inside you'd never know it. If you need a quiet place to relax, the atmosphere inside is downright funereal. The patrons don't seem unusually meek, so it might be some kind of bizarre psychoacoustic trick - either way, if you want to chat with your bros, you'll be happier doing it outside on the patio.  The main draw for me is bottomless coffee for $3.05. Much as I like places like Epoch, they don't have cheap bottomless coffee, and that can be a dealbreaker on some days. However, their regular coffees are completely serviceable, and you can rock those without regret if you don't have a deadline-induced need to be as maximally caffeinated as possible.  Aside from that, there's enough parking for a coffee shop at least twice as large, and a decent selection of snacks, although they don't have the food that Thunderbird does. Sometimes their wifi is really slow for me though, but the issues usually seems to vanish as soon as it gets noticeable.  All in all a worthy addition to your coffee shop rotation. ", pos 
Genuine Joe ," 6/26/2012 The best way to describe this place is that it doesn't try too hard. Not that it's not trying at all, because it is. Or that it is trying to appear as if it is not trying. That just kind of hurts the head. Rather, it hits the perfect medium. Like Baby Bear's porridge.  In other words, Genuine Joe is laid back and unassuming. None of the furniture matches, but it also doesn't feel consciously eclectic. The staff is friendly, but they don't yell greetings as you enter. Basically, I sat by a window with my coffee and pastry and was comfortable and content.  Also, the first thing I noticed as I walked in was the giant rainbow flag. Gay friendly? Awesome! ", pos

Great space, perfect for socializing, although I hear they do not have wifi here so keep that in mind if you're looking for a place to work remote. Service was really helpful and friendly.  The drip coffee was good and satisfying. Iced latte was a bit disappointing and reminded me of one of those Starbucks iced coffees you buy at the grocery store. Not really a fan.

I love walking into a place and the staff greats you with a genuine smile. It is such a rarity these days that when it happens I can't help but automatically smile back. Instant mood enhancer for sure!

During my stay in Austin for ACL I got my caffeine fix here. I ended up getting an east side spice in nitro on two different days as well as the cortado. Both drinks were executed perfectly. The cortado was beautiful to look at with some latte art and was sugar rimmed. The nitro drink was just real pretty on the glass that it's presented.  The ambiance here is pretty chill. People here come in for the morning coffee or just to get work done. There are plenty of outlets and there is also a very pleasant outdoor sitting bar area to enjoy the beautiful Austin weather.

The ambience here is something I like in coffee shops. It is open and aesthetically pleasing. As mentioned, the coffee was good. I tried their nitrogenated coffee even though I am not a big fan of cold coffees. It was better than what I was expecting, and although it is not something I would order regularly (and only because I do not have a taste for cold coffee), I can easily someone who likes their coffee cold falling in love with it.  I will definitely come back for their other offerings. Prepping our drinks Inside Latte See all photos from Clarice O. for Cuvée Coffee Bar ", pos 
Cuvée Coffee Bar ," 11/30/2016 Great coffee, beer and wine. This is such a cute spot. You can also rent out the venue for parties! They will set up the place to your liking and it was the perfect spot for our Birthday Party. The price was great, and the staff were amazing and worked with me on making the event a hit!! They have a bunch of little extras that they throw in to help make your event fun! I have told everyone about this hidden gem! Plus it's a local place and I love that. I kept getting compliments on choosing a cool venue where we could all eat, drink and mingle. Had my Birthday party here and they let us bring in our own treats ", pos

No one owes you wifi.  Stop being a shitty customer.  If I've learned anything from working in the service industry it's that the customer is almost always wrong. , pos

Cuvée Coffee Bar ," 2/26/2016 1 check-in Listed in Hello Yelp 100 - it's 2016, My Fix, Second Home Need to unplug? Consider stopping by Cuvee.  I understand that the world needs electronics to get stuff done, but sometimes you just want to get away and read, write, or think without having to reach for your wifi-enabled devices. (If you have a data plan, then...no one's stopping you from that, I suppose)  Their nitro coffee (Black & Blue) is pretty special - it's brewed similarly to Guinness (minus the alcohol), so you get the smoothest, creamiest cup of coffee poured into a beer goblet/chalice.  It's a great introduction to potentially taking your coffee black, although Cuvee offers both milk and simple syrups (brilliant, since table sugar is difficult to dissolve in cold drinks) to temper it.  Also, I have to say that their brand imagery is some of the best I've seen for a local coffee shop - a bright blue motif throughout all of their decor and marketing materials make Cuvee stand out among the local coffee shops.  Tasty coffee, great ambiance, pretty colors - my friend took me here because it's his favorite coffee shop, and now I've become quite partial to Cuvee. Nitro coffee. Goes down silky smooth. ", pos 
Cuvée Coffee Bar , 10/9/2016 You can find me at Cuvee almost every other morning. They make great coffee and their baristas are awesome. The nitro cold brew (Black and Blue) is the best. We are fortunate to have it on tap at work and it is dangerously good and addicting.   Pro tip: grab a cold brew at Cuvee and then walk over to Counter Cafe East for breakfast on the weekends.  They do NOT however have wifi but people are always there working. I get their stance but would love to have the wifi. , pos 
Cuvée Coffee Bar ," 6/27/2016 2 check-ins This is a cute coffee place that serves great cold brew. We went here since they allow dogs to sit on their little outdoor area. Inside, they had an area where you could fill up a water bowl for your dog and treats for dogs too. As for coffee, I got their regular cold brew and it was very good. They also serve Tacodeli breakfast tacos here that are quite amazing. I just got two of their beans and papas (potato) tacos with some salsa. If you like spicy, get the green one. It's really good and taste like spicy avocado. Definitely a great coffee spot that serves great quick breakfast too. Freshly made green tea & Yellow Rose IPA. Dog-friendly outdoor seating. Great cold brew! ", pos 
Cuvée Coffee Bar ," 3/23/2016 While I get the reasoning behind no wifi, as someone who works remotely it definitely effects my decision on where to get coffee. If they had Wifi, this would be the perfect spot to get some work done.  That aside, what more can you ask for in a coffee shop? They have a great aesthetic, fantastic coffee and beer selections, bright-faced baristas, and Taco Deli!

Cuvée Coffee Bar ," 3/20/2016 1 check-in Listed in Yelp 100 Challenge 2016 Unlike the failed HERO ordinance of Houston, Texas, this pro civilization place has unisex bathrooms that don't make you feel like you are being excluded from the inclusivity that you want when in a Venn diagram. Also, when you approach the place from east downtown it's a walking distance from several places including my friend's where I was coming from at the time of this coffee experience.  They have a beautiful patio that has a huge ramp that definitely complies with the ADA. Once you go inside you start to wonder why you didn't sit on the patio but you are now inside and the barista is making coffee and different beverages and you're like wow this is so cool. I mean the barista you can only hope is making coffee if you are at a coffee shop lol. Next we all placed our orders and we had two choices for the coffee beans a. From El Salvador, or b) Ethiopia. I had mine with steamed milk and chose the Ethiopian. They give you different options for milk. I had whole milk.  My coffee was delicious. Unlike the hit or miss consistency of Starbucks, this place delivered everything you imagined them to and then some. We decided to sit indoors and the inside is just as fascinating as the outside. We were sitting away from the barista but we could see that he was very engaging with the patrons at the counter.  If I lived in Austin, this would be my place to go every single day. ", pos

Cuvée Coffee Bar ," 5/24/2015 Updated review 3 check-ins ROTD 8/27/2015 I really hate the fact that reviews from people who think every coffee shop should be their own personal workspace are bringing down the overall rating of Cuvée.  They don't have wifi. Deal with it. Who ever said that free wifi at coffee shops should be ""mandatory"" anyway? Cuvée wants to foster an environment for an enjoyable social experience without having everyone stare at their screens.  IMHO, they have some of the best coffee beans in the country!!! Don't let the haters and unrealistic reviews keep you away ", pos 
Cuvée Coffee Bar ," 12/21/2015 The vibe was relaxing. The fact that the space opens up to the outdoors is also great on a fair-weathered day. The coffee was also good here - but I wouldn't say that it stands out considering that there's many other coffee shops in town. What makes this place stands out is pretty evident if you do bother going through other Yelpers' reviews - it's the cold-brew, nitrogenated coffee, which I haven't yet tried. And yes, they have this even on tap.  I thought it to be interesting that it had its humble beginnings in Dallas, and then moved shop to Austin. Their product can be found all over Texas in several retail outlets, so good for them.  I'm not much of a fan for the cold-brew but if you or someone you know is a fan of cold-brew, then by all means, do come here. They also serve TacoDeli food, so that's a plus for those who loves the tacos from that local establishment. ", pos 
Cuvée Coffee Bar ," 4/27/2015 I had just had brunch at Hi Hat and was in the mood for some espresso. This being just a block down the street seemed like a good place to walk to to get one on a beautiful day. The woman taking my order and making the espresso was very nice. The woman who checked me out was not as nice, but nice nonetheless. The espresso itself was good, not exceptional, but good and it got the job done. I'm all about espresso, but they have a number of other coffee options and all looked pretty great.  Parking in the area is easy. Service was quick. The inside area is super clean and chill. I sat outside and took in the great weather. A good place to stop by for a decent coffee when in the area. Espresso plus water with ""gas"" as they'd say in Europe ", neutral 
Cuvée Coffee Bar ," 12/11/2015 I've only lived in Austin about 13 days and I've probably been to this place about six times already.  Everyone who works there is always nice, and they serve Tacodeli tacos which are freaking delicious.  I've had a couple different types of coffee drinks. Iced coffee, cold brew, americano, etc. Their coffee has a very clear acidity that I honestly just don't really like. I can tell the coffee is great but I think its a matter of personal taste. I'll definitely keep coming back though, because it's close to where I work and again, everyone is just always so nice. ", neutral

Cuvée Coffee Bar ," 9/5/2015 3 check-ins I love cuvee coffee roasters and you can find their coffee at many cafes around town.  I am especially in love with their ntiro Black & Blue coffee, which just doesn't taste as good from a can, and is harder to find on tap.  I recently discovered that Black & Blue on tap is unpredictable, which can be the result of many reasons someone was explaining.  However, the place were it is always creamy, frothy, and nutty delicious is at Cuvee Coffee Bar.  Yes, it is a definite trendy hipster hangout spot.  The interior a marriage or clash of metal meets wood.  The bar is located front and center with seating all around.  The front side of the bar is for daytime caffeine addicts, and the backside boozy taps by night.  They have a small pastry selection to chew on.  I love that they partner with Blackbird Bakery for gluten free pastries.  For coffee lovers they have espressos, pour overs, cold brew, and nitro. On the other side, they have draft beers and wine on tap.    It seems like everyone is up in arms about their lack of Wi-Fi.  But, most people nowadays seem to have hot spots on their cell phones.  Austin is full of laptop friendly options, so not sure what all the fuss is about.  If I am out with friends, I am not concerned about my WI-FI availability.

Options of milk or substitute available. I love the mocha, but can vary slightly depending on the day. Sit out or in, and dogs enjoy hanging out in front. If hungry, they have tacos from TacoDeli and some pastries, that look delicious.  Taco's run out, so be forewarned. ", pos

Cuvée Coffee Bar ," 8/25/2015 9 check-ins Cuvée is one of the best roasters in town and their espresso with steamed milk is on point. You can buy their beans and enjoy those at home too...but I've always found my cortado / cappuccino / latte to be especially good when I order at their coffee bar.  For a unique cold coffee, try their nitro version on tap. I personally don't crave it but it's a popular one with the locals...and more and more beyond Austin.  Everybody hatin' because they don't provide wifi but that's not a reason to dock stars on a review if they've made their intentions clear (which they do). Come here with a friend or to read a book.

Cuvée Coffee Bar ," 11/1/2016 Cuvee is one of my favorite places to visit when I'm in Austin for their nitro cold brew, but I also hired them to cater the coffee every morning for a 3 day conference I held in downtown Austin. The coordinators were extremely helpful throughout the year while I was planning and everything went great the days of the event. Their coffee was still delicious after it had been sitting out for a few hours at our event. My only regret was not hiring them to provide more coffee every afternoon too! I would highly recommend their locations and coffee catering services. ", pos 
Cuvée Coffee Bar ," 12/8/2014 1 check-in Listed in ShangriLa Le-Dah & other East Side Shenanigans, Life is like a cup of coffee Cuvée Coffee Black & Blue is the best cold brewed coffee I have had. It is the first nitrgonated coffee which gives it a nice thick frothiness. Its rich nutty flavor reminiscent of a porter makes it simply the best.  The custom metal work that makes up the bar, taps and the amazing fixture above the bar was made by Blackwell Welding just outside of Austin. They do espressos, pour overs, have 9 beers on draft and two wines on tap. The space is awesome and they can boast having one of the top baristas Lorenzo Perkins on their team.

They make my daughter lovely little hot chocolates with hearts on top, and I get a freaking fantastic latte made with the smoothest coffee in town and the highest quality milk. I also tried one of their seasonal drinks soley because it was named ""Son of a Nutcracker!"" and it was fantastic. Just mildly sweet and perfectly spiced. Added bonus: gluten free ""pop tarts"" which are really puff pastry filled with jam and topped with icing.

Cuvée Coffee Bar ," 2/8/2016 Cuvee is a wonderful place to enjoy some of the best coffee that Austin has to offer with a friend. Take heed that this is not a place to come and work on your laptop all day. There's no WiFi. As a result, you usually see people here talking and enjoying each other's company. I appreciate that because I've been to too many places where every table is occupied by someone at a laptop, working silently, and it almost feels out of place to have a conversation. I don't know when cafes became synonymous with free WiFi, but it's kind of ridiculous. I don't think people would complain that a nice restaurant doesn't have free WiFi. Cuvee is selling excellent coffee, not WiFi with a side of coffee. You have many other options in the area if you just want to work and drink coffee.  Cuvee's coffee is excellent. They also serve a good selection of beer and a bit of food from local places. Cuvee is a great local roaster and you can be confident that you're tasting a well-roasted coffee, whatever type you get. Nothing charred or baked. There are lots of good local roasters, but Cuvee is a sure bet. If you brew at home you'll want to try their beans. I usually get a pour-over but their espresso is great too.  I'd recommend trying their black and blue nitrogenated coffee, a pour-over, some kind of espresso drink, and maybe a beer if you're still standing. You could then grab something to eat next door at Counter Cafe and maybe have a walk around the area. ", pos

Cuvée Coffee Bar ," 9/4/2015 I was really excited about coming here and knocking out a few homework problems in between classes. After I got my drink (which was delicious), I noticed that I couldn't connect to the wifi to work on my homework. I asked the cashier if it was broken and he said rather abruptly ""No, we don't have wifi."" That's it. No explanation or even so much as a ""Sorry about that."" I found this to be pretty rude.  I don't think it's unreasonable of me to expect wifi at a super fancy coffee shop when most coffee shops, fancy or not, and other public spaces readily supply it. Wifi has become a boon to good customer service. Additionally, I don't understand what their reasons are for not offering it (seeing as no one offered any explanation). Some have speculated that they don't have wifi as to encourage people to interact. Well, I would have considered bringing a study group there (i.e. a group of customers who would interact and not to mention, buy coffee), but modern education often requires internet access. Two of my textbooks are online only!  My questions for them are, what are you really trying to accomplish by not offering wifi? Is this a logical decision that is yielding great results for the business? If it is, maybe there's something you can do to help employees have more effective conversations with customers about your decision so that customers don't feel snubbed.  I can only speak for myself, but based on my experience I'm unlikely to go back to Cuvée. ", neutral

Maybe even add a cute wi-fi symbol with a circle and cross out line. Perfect coffeeshop communication. It's evident from the reviews on here that you haven't trained your baristas how to properly communicate the issue. In a time when coffeeshop is synonymous with free wi-fi (and for those not in the know, it is), you need to make your patrons feel more welcomed to the different approach.  Or don't and keep knocking your customer retention efforts.  But, when you have multiple people saying the same thing and knocking you for the same reasons, from a business standpoint you're doing something wrong.

Staff was super friendly and espresso was on point. Definitely adding this spot to my rotation on the way to work.  Update: I just realized this place doesn't have wifi.

Cuvée Coffee Bar ," 8/29/2015 1 check-in I arrived in Austin around 11:30 PM on Thursday evening, Friday morning I needed my coffee. After having breakfast tacos, I Yelped and found Cuvee to be nearby as I was staying with a friend in East Austin. It was hot and muggy out and all I wanted was straight iced/cold brew coffee and to my surprise they have a Black & Blue which is nitrogenated cold coffee. Being from Los Angeles and been to Seattle and Portland multiple times I've had Stumptown's cold brew and cold brew on nitro, so I thought I'd give it a try to see how it compared. I got a large Black & Blue, it was refreshingly cool, nice and strong and very very smooth. I can't say that I like Stumptown or Cuvee more but both establishments make a pretty mean nitro cold brew coffee. The inside of Cuvee looks pretty modern and had a painted walk, they serve their coffee on tap and they serve alcohol on tap also. I also found out that Cuvee is one of the bigger suppliers of coffee in Austin. When I'm in Austin, I will definitely come back to Cuvee for my coffee fix, and if it's not as hot I'd like to try something else. They also have canned Black & Blue but I totally forgot to pick couple of them up on my way out, I don't know of anyone else who cans nitro cold brew coffee so that's pretty unique.

Cuvée Coffee Bar ," 7/5/2016 I drink Black and Blue like it's water, its on tap at my local pub. I wanted to check this place out since I love Cuvee so much and have also been on their roastery tour as well. The place looked cool, but for me had a sterile feel. I thought perhaps it was me since I do not fit the normal customer I assume due to my age, but then saw others reviewing the same that they were cold/pretentoius. Once I started talking more to them, and I guess they figured I was not lost or trying to find a Starbucks, or someones dad, they were more friendly. The brewchata was AWESOME, would make a great after dinner or lunch drink. I use their beans at home and like I said, love that Nitro... I would go back again. And yes, the default 25% tip is a turn off. In a nut shell  just didn't fell welcome. I will be going back again since I do like the goods, and perhaps caught them on a bad day. ", neutral

I guess you can call me old fashion because I like my coffeehouses to have some character to them. I don't mind if they don't have wifi. That doesn't really deter me from trying out new coffeehouses. In the morning they have Tacodeli tacos along with their usual coffee. Why am I giving it three stars? I'm going to be in the minority as say their iced brewed coffee was gross.

Cuvée Coffee Bar ," 1/31/2016 Cuvee isn't new to the coffee game! I've been buying their whole beans every since I moved to Austin so I was excited when Mike McKim announced they were opening a coffee bar. They treat their coffee as a craft! I started by trying three of their beers on tap. I had Austin Beerworks' Sputnik, Blue Owl Brewery's Dapper Devil, and 4th Tap Brewing Co-Op's Supernaut on Nitro. I'm glad I asked for a recommendation from the barista because the Supernaut was hands down my favorite! The nitro just adds a creaminess to the beer that you can't beat. Each beer was really good in it's own way. Dapper Devil is one I would really enjoy drinking in the summer. It's a sour ale made with raspberries and I like the tart flavor of it.  The staff was super friendly and willing to give me recommendations on what I ordering (aka also knowledgeable)! I ordered a pour over to go with the Cuberow (Ethiopian) beans. It was smooth and a little earthy (in a good way)! I noticed they had some gluten-free pastries. Ended up snagging two GF poptarts to go! So glad I stopped in again. I wish there was one up north!  This isn't a place to go if you're in a hurry. It's all about slowing down and savoring what you're drinking. They care about what they're making there. There's no WIFI but that actually got me to talk to the guy who sat next to me. Turns out we're both coffee enthusiasts and I walked away with some great recommendations. ", pos

The two female baristas were running a smooth operation and were great servers, and the store was nicely decorated, but it wasn't really our taste. We're not huge cold brew fans, even though theirs was yummy, and the menu was sort of limited by not serving a lot of traditional coffeehouse drinks.

They have a number of food trucks out in the back - but be warned - the lines and wait can get long if you get here at peak breakfast / brunch hour.  The tacos were DELICIOUS though - and the granola and yogurt I got from the African food truck was honestly the best yogurt and granola I have ever had.

As you walk in there is a food truck with awesome food and then to your left the coffee shop. It's really nice in there it was about to close, but they had a lot of seating and lots of cool drinks including alcohol. It's open late so it's a nice place to go and have some drinks or coffee with friends or even a casual date night. My Carmel Latte was to die for and my other half's Dirty Chai was on point. They also had a Zucchini bread that caught my eye as we were about to pay and of course I had to try it.

If I go south of the river, I really REALLY like you.  Like, for real.  That said, I've been to Radio twice now and the first time I was stoked to get cold brew on tap but was not impressed with their terrible parking situation.  Fast forward a year or two and they have that parking situation remedied.  This last time I got a chai and was totally stoked on it.  The spice and flavors were on point but my only gripe (this is probably a novice complaint) was that it wasn't sweet at all. That's OK though, I got some simple syrup and fixed that shizz.  The interior was also quiet and chill.  I almost felt uncomfortable having a conversation about life happenings because it was just quiet.

We love to hunker down here and get some work done among the cover music playing on the stereos (enjoy in good weather outside).

Radio Coffee & Beer ," 7/26/2016 Well, I can't give 2 stars to a place I choose to go back to often, can I? So 3 stars it is.  Let me start with the good: * Good coffee & Beer * Great for kids - not all places in this town are good for kids * I love the events. We've gone here for a couple of bluegrass concerts now.  Now for the bad: * While accommodating, they don't seem to care to do so with a smile, regardless of how I show up (with wife and kid, with a friend for a beer, with a laptop to work). This is somewhat of a systemic problem in Austin, and they are only enabling the issue. * This place is only a good place to work when they want you to work - which is not after 5pm. Wifi shuts down at that time. (tip for Radio: you can set up multiple routers, and cut internet off to 75% of the place rather than entirely - if you're goal is to focus attention on the live music and change the environment) I work non-traditional hours as many do in this city, but Radio seems to give zero f's about this.  I will continue going here mostly because it's a great place for my family, and since that seems to be how they want me to show up - to hang out/chill and not to work.  My suggestion is to take a note out of Strange Brew's book, and make area's of your place that are accommodating to everyone. ", neutral

Radio Coffee & Beer ," 11/22/2015 One of the classiest coffee places in the city - hands down.  The coffee itself is outstanding.  Many places when they offer a ""premium custom gourmet special"" espresso -  what is often offered is an indifferent not-worth-it coffee.  (This means you, Houndstooth.)  Here, the premium beans are worth it and they are expertly brewed.  The location is spectacular.  Everyone hangs around outside like they do at the Draught House Pub -  But the outdoor setup is much nicer than that at the Draught House Pub  (More greenery, more room, more space, heaters)  Two excellent food trailers don't exactly hurt the outdoor ambience.  Indoors there is a ton of room and a lot of seats. Big tables to work at and the chairs are actually comfortable. Decorating is dark but with fine windows to bring in the light.  One quirk. They only have internet monday thru friday bankers hours.  They do coffee by day and beer by night and weekends. (although both are available at all times)  But they really take seriously the idea of work 9-5, play nights and weekends.  I was there on a weekend afternoon and there were plenty of tables with some people drinking coffee and others drinking beer.  (A few people were drinking both. Hey, keep Austin Weird.)  I did not need internet this visit, but normally no internet is a deal breaker for me.  However, I have gotten so used to the internet cutting out from overuse at prime office coffee houses - that I now travel with my own MyFi just on general principles.  So Radio can't stop me from using the internet!!!!  BWAH HA HA HA HA!!!!!  (Maniacal laughter followed by a wild eyed impersonation of a mad scientist in the movies.)  The bottom line here is that the quirky internet policies here are not a problem.  That opens up Radio's other serious positives as something to be taken seriously.  The crowd is massively cool.  Both the coffee menu and the beer menus are first rate.  The food trailers are a great addition.  The physical ambience can't be beat.  And the place has plenty of room.  So what more do you want?  A great place to both work and play. ", pos

Radio Coffee & Beer ," 9/11/2016 Radio. I love you and I hate you. It's all about the space- the courtyard and climbing tree are awesome, I don't care about parking down the street. 8 out of 10 times the coffee is great. Expect smug and crappy attitudes, baristas making fun of patrons drink choices, a significant wait if the staff doesn't feel like making your order and filthy tables and floors. ", neutral

Radio Coffee & Beer ," 1/18/2016 1 check-in Coffee shop, bar, music venue, this place is worth checking out. They serve Stumptown coffee, so that should make any coffee hipster happy. The place is pretty large and has a great patio section. They cover it to keep the elements out so you should be fine most any time of the year.  The VeraCruz taco trailer is right outside too so you can hangout for a few hours and get work done. The staff is super friendly as are the patrons. I find it easy to just start up a conversation with people here.  Once nighttime hits, the WiFi turns off and it becomes a bar with live music. Their beer selection is pretty legit I must say. A lot of craft and local breweries are represented here. Would be great for a laid back date night.  The only major downside is the parking. Place is popular, the lot is small, and that area is challenging for street parking. Otherwise, pretty awesome place! ", pos 
Radio Coffee & Beer , 7/27/2016 Coffee and beer are two things that make any work week better. It's hard to review this place without taking into consideration the amazing food truck on their property!  I was impressed with the amount of beers on tap including my favorite blue owl! They even had many different varieties from the various craft breweries.  Inside is small and dark but there are so many picnic tables for seating outside! Its an easy place to meet up to chat with friends.  I'll have to go back soon to check out their movie nights. They had school of rock playing when I left! , pos 
Radio Coffee & Beer ," 7/11/2016 Radio is a solid spot for a cup of coffee when you want to hang out in the afternoon breeze.  The coffee shop boasts great coffee, craft beer, and kombucha on tap. I like to post up with a drink and soak up the sun--the large open area seating outside is perfect. They have two food trucks (tacos and African cuisine) to satisfy any food cravings, though the wait can be lengthy. They recently added more parking in the back to alleviate the past parking issues. Prices are reasonable for coffee and while there can be a line, it usually moves pretty quickly. Sometimes Radio feels a little too cool for school, and not super welcoming, but the staff are helpful enough.  My only real complaint is they turn the Wi-Fi off in the evening. I understand they're trying to change the atmosphere at night into more of a bar with music, but it just relocates me to another coffee shop. Overall, either during the week or the weekend, when I'm looking for a great outdoor patio, Radio is high on my list. ", pos 
Radio Coffee & Beer ," 10/7/2016 Super hip. I do love Radio, but it's the kind of place that people dress up and go to be seen. And when I say dress up, I mean dress up so perfectly that no one knows you don't always roll out of bed looking as cool as you do when you come here. The parking is usually a nightmare and finding a seat is a challenge too. HOWEVER, the staff is friendly, the coffee is great and this is a great place to meet a friend or client. This is not a laid back coffee shop, but rather a perfectly curated Austin social spot. ", pos

Radio Coffee & Beer ," 6/3/2015 3 check-ins Best Caramel Latte in town!    In the evenings, there's a younger guy who has a totally cool curly haired mo-hawk thing going on.  He is the one you want to make your latte.  I have no idea what he does to make it so creamy and flavorful, but when you only allow yourself one coffee a week you are very picky about the where, when, who of it all.    So let me tell you...IT IS WORTH IT!    I tip him almost the full price of the latte itself and refuse to let anyone else make it except him.  Others have tried, he's the winner every time.  Only reason it's not 5 stars... - parking stinks, - no gluten free options for someone who is required to be G free, and - the mosquitoes are awful since all of the rain.  Oh, if you need internet any other time other than from 8-5, M-F, it is not available.  I get why they do it, but that can be stinky when you really want to study after work yet you don't want to go home.  But who wants a wet blanket around?!  So, go try it out and do so on Monday when the regular band is there and people watch and pet some dogs. ", pos

The vibe is really young and fresh but, welcoming to young families with it's outdoor seating and space to hang around. The food trucks outside are convenient and give it the authentic Austin feel.  I tried the nitro (basically a cold brew coffee that tastes like guinness's coffee sister) the first day and a latte the second day. I enjoyed both a lot - I was really hoping for a traditional iced coffee the first day but was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed the nitro.  My one caveat about the place is definitely that the line can become massively long. Waves of people come in on the weekends so be sure to leave yourself some time! ", pos

It can get pretty bad and sometimes you'll drive around for 30 minutes looking for a spot and then just give up and go to Wheatsville for coffee. They have added additional parking behind the businesses next door, but those are often full, too. Once you make it into a parking spot, Radio is a great spot to hang out- which is what people do, hence the lack of parking openings. ", pos 
Radio Coffee & Beer ," 4/7/2016 I went on a Monday night to listen to bluegrass.  Band was great, ambiance was great.  Only complaint is that they and the food trucks didn't seem well prepared for the crowd.  50 minutes for a taco?  I don't think so.  And items would be forgotten and server would forget to come back. I'm sure I'd enjoy it more with less people. See all photos from Cherry T. for Radio Coffee & Beer ", neutral

We came at night and it had such a nice Austin ambience to it, with lights strung around its patio and a great throwback soundtrack. There's plenty of seating outside, but it's more limited inside.  They also had a live band playing inside, which was neat. We didn't get to hear them since we were enjoying the night air outside, but they have little events or activities every night.  I got their hot chocolate and it was delicious. Wouldn't say it's the best since trying this amazing place in Chicago, but it was a good cup and warmed the night. ", pos 
Radio Coffee & Beer ," 1/22/2016 Updated review 3 check-ins I was fixin to write a complainey review about how I'm consistently frustrated by the parking here.  This fact remains true, but I've shifted course.  Instead I'm going to write a review about the friendly staff. I just had a particularly lovely interaction with a sweetheart barista who kindly asked me how my morning has been. When I told her honestly it was pretty crappy, she told me a cute story and cheered me up. She also wished me a better day in a way that felt sincere, and it totally changed my outlook.  I got an awesome coffee and a pep talk for about $5. Thank you, red head barista with the bangs! You exemplify what I think are important qualities in this line of work.  Beyond great coffee and kind people, Radio has a very welcoming atmosphere inside and out. There are both communal tables and smaller ones for individuals or pairs. They have several delicious food trucks stationed outside, an herb an veggie garden and a fire pit. The place almost feels a bit like a ski lodge, save for being at the intersection of two highly trafficked roads. But from the interior of the courtyard or sitting in one of the comfy leather couches inside, it hardly feels like a roadside stop. It's quiet and calming.  Radio also has some great programming in the evening. Several of my local musician friends have played here and they have a calendar of movies and other fun stuff. My kind of place! ", pos

I hosted a little work from home party here, fingers crossed that the space would be conducive to said WFH. It was perfect - not only for some internetting but also for anything you'd like.

The atmosphere here is great although it can get pretty crowded inside since everyone is trying to escape the death heat outside. At night it's not as bad, of course.

There was a covered area and an open area (for sun lovers and sun haters, equal opportunity), and another non-taco truck (that I didn't try).

Radio Coffee & Beer ," 4/27/2016 This is hands down my favorite coffee shop in Austin!!!! I was super stoked to see that they were building a coffee shop in south Austin, but I wondered, how will it measure up? Well, its measurements so happen to be through the ROOF! First of all, the name is perfect. I love the radio and everything about it. I love talking on a radio. I love radio signals and antenna. Last but not least, radiohead Is one of my top favorite bands and honestly changed my life. So the name Radio is special to me, and their sign is tight!!!! There are so many amazing qualities about this place ... Where do I begin? The coffee is powerful. It will wake you up!!! The baristas are very skilled at making artistic designs on the lattes. Speaking of the baristas, they are all so friendly and pretty hilarious. They make going there a lot of fun. I enjoy their tea selection and they serve it to you in the cutest tea pot! : } their desserts are off the chain too. Tuesday nights are vinyl night. You can bring your favorite vinyl, and they'll play it for you. My favorite was when someone brought in Harvest by Neil Young. When it's not record night, these folks bring it with the music selection!!!! They play anything from Gorillaz to Daft Punk to Uncle Acid & the Deadbeats to Tame Impala to some underground Houston hip hop. I spent many months studying for the MCAT there very regularly. It was an awesome study spot because many people study and do work there. But don't be fooled, there is also lots of room to party there too. It's the best of both worlds. The food is fabulous. I adore the fish tacos from the Vera Cruz food truck. The art on the walls are so spectacular and dreamy. The bathrooms are always clean and the soap smells fantastic. All in all, my memories at Radio are special. I met many people there and also ran into old friends.  P.S. I did well on my MCAT and got accepted to medical school! Thanks for being there for me, Radio. ", pos

Radio Coffee & Beer ," 8/11/2014 3 check-ins ROTD 6/20/2015 Listed in My reviews of the day Space: The building and the outside patios (and lights) are all beautiful and well constructed. It's very modern and it's not a converted strip mall, like Strange Brew down the street. The space is clean, well-designed, and in a part of town that is starving for coffee shops. There are flowers and actual landscaping, etc.  Food: There's a Vera Cruz taco truck with some of the best tacos in Austin right in the parking lot, and they serve East Side Pies pizza inside by the slice until it runs out. I tried the migas tacos and really liked them.    Coffee: There are lots of coffees (draft coffee!) and beers, and I look forward to coming back. It's less down and out than Strange Brew, which seems to have switched gears to live music, which is fine.  Noise: The outdoor music was a little loud, as was the construction noise happening around us at 2:00 on a Saturday. But I went the first week and I'm sure these issues have all resolved themselves now.  Issues: The only issues are 1) the parking. There seem to have been lots of complaints about that already. 2) good space for the kids. There are lots of families visiting, and so it would be neat to have a little slide or toy area or something that more and more places have these days.  The spot sort of reminds me of the Thunderbird on Manor Road. I would recommend it to anyone, and look forward to going back. Veracruz Tacos ", pos

Lots of large tables outside would make this a nice spot for a small group.  The crowd was constant as expected for a late Saturday morning but it never felt overcrowded and service was quick.  Every sip of the Nitro cold brew coffee on tap is worth the $4 price tag, and my wife had to conscientiously pace herself taking down her latte because it was so good.

There were some food trucks and lots of vendors, super Austin-y things like soap and such. The only reason I am docking a star is parking. There are about ten parking spaces in the actual lot and the street parking is nonexistent since it is right in a residential neighborhood.

I luckily got a spot right as someone was pulling out of it, but I can see how parking would be tough if there are no spots in the lot available. I ordered an iced almond milk latte, which was pretty good. After about 15 minutes it tasted a little watered down though - I like bigger ice cubes that don't melt as quickly. I also ordered an apple fritter from their pastry case, which was SOOO good.

Radio Coffee & Beer ," 6/15/2014 2 check-ins Listed in ""Nuptial Coffee Bliss!"" It would never occur to me to combine a genuine coffeehouse with a hip beer place - I'm seeing a lot of these lately - but if it's working, cool. At 1:30 in the afternoon on opening day, half of us here were doing coffee, and the other half doing craft beers. I'm pretty sure they were craft beers.  Think Buzz Mill plunked on Manchaca, with less flannel and Veracruz All Natural instead of Blue Ox. The parking lot is geometrically interesting, they're still tweaking the large outside patio area, and I think this is going to be one popular place. I am slightly discomfited when I see children having a grand old time inside a beer tap environment, but they're your kids, not mine. Whatevs.  Radio was doing a killer drip Stumptown from Portland at $2 a pop, with fifty-cent refills. I could camp on that stuff all day. The barista guy was getting a serious workout, and so was the guy pulling beer. They had slices from East Side Pies at the counter. Opening day buzz is always exciting, but I also think Radio needs just a little time to settle in, and literally let some grass grow around the place. And then we can all settle down as they become the next South Austin icon. Mmmm, delicious hipster beer here! Okay, I think this is delicious hipster beer being served here... ", pos

The bartenders/baristas actually care about the drinks they're making and take pride in their work. There are clearly regulars here, and the staff knows who they are, what they like, and a bit about them. The kombucha on tap is a new addition, but every flavor I've tried has been delicious. They'll fill a growler for you, and it's only $15. The atmosphere is very cool, and there is plenty of seating (indoor and out).  Here's what I don't love (and there's not much): Don't expect to get any work done here -- it's always really noisy.

However, it is a $7 treat because they charge you for the beer and reg price of a double shot...it is what it is.  I also had some nice, rare bottle beer choices, but had some ""sticker shock"" here as well as they were not published anywhere that I could find.  But, other than the price tag surprise at the register, this is a hip little coffee shop with a bar and I can already tell after a completely fully occupied interior on my second visit that this place is a S. Lamar hit.  I had their on-tap Kombucha my 2nd time around and it was pretty good. It made a nice accompaniment to my Veracruz tacos.  There is ample outdoor seating, but beware, as with every other new restaurant/bar/attraction to pop in Austin, parking is an issue. You will have to seek out either residential street parking or wait until nightfall to park in the back of the auto-parts store which I was told is ""allowed"" by a fellow desperate parking seeker.  They serve pizza inside, but I am not exactly sure what kind (they are outsourced from a local place) or for how much as I did not see a menu to this effect.

Radio Coffee & Beer ," 7/23/2014 4 check-ins What isn't there to love about this place?  The only thing I can think of is that it isn't located closer to North Austin.  Thankfully it isn't ""too"" far to get here from my dog's southerly located groomer.  I will drive the extra few minutes further past my former  coffee wait spot to head here.  It's just that good and everyone else knows it too. Just a few months old, and yet it had an endless line of patrons waiting to order drinks throughout my several hour stay here.    This is no shabby coffee shack. As you drive up the first goal is to just find a parking spot. While there is a small parking lot, I never once saw a free spot, and down the road the neighborhood street was completely full.  They have a great well kept up outdoor seating area, with a Veracruz Natural food truck serving up fresh tacos. Inside is inviting in wood tones, but not upscale modern.  The staff are super friendly and talkative.  The next goal is to find a place to sit, their are plenty of outlets for your computer along the wall, but not many smaller tables, you might need to ask a neighbor to share something.  They should invest in some outlets along the bar.  They offer a variety of eating options: pastries, pharmacy café gluten free pastries (the ones wrapped in plastic), Veracruz Natural Tacos, or East Side pies.  They have a great beer selection well paired with their amazing Stumptown coffee.  It's not surprising that the owner while a native Texan, spent sometime amongst the coffee gurus in my hometown Seattle.  It's like bringing the best of both worlds to Austin.  I couldn't believe they even served the Stumptown nitro draft style right next to it's neighboring beer friends.  After some of that, I am forever ruined.  I can't have Stumptown cold brew any other way now. They even had some decent loose leaf teas that they served to you in a tea kettle.  Just go up front to check out the plastic menu's off to the side at the cash register too order, and wait for your order before sitting down.  Rare to say you have a favorite coffee - beer joint. Wow..actually ventured to try something other than Stumptown nitro coffee - the cappuccino was delicious! Nitro Stumptown Cold Brew w/ Zucchini Gluten Free Bread from Peoples Pharmacy.

Radio Coffee & Beer ," 9/19/2014 6 check-ins Anyone who brews Stumptown is fine in my book. Radio even seems like the kind of hipster coffee joint you would find in Portland, minus the awesome tacos. No one does tacos like Veracruz.  It's a great setting as you can choose between sitting inside at the polished, wooden bar, lounging on lawn chairs outside with your dog, or sitting with a group at the benches near the food truck. You will see lots of Macbook Pros, beards, and plaid at this casual hangout. Service is friendly and pretty quick despite their using post-it notes for order taking.  The worst (and best) part of Radio is that you have to decide between breakfast tacos or Eastside Pies. But technically, you could just eat both. It's an easy place to stay awhile and make the seamless transition from coffee to beer or beer to coffee. Your choice. They've even got cold brew and kombucha on tap. Yep- South Austin just got more awesome. Interior ", pos

Dominican Joe ," 8/21/2016 1 check-in I came in here not expecting much out of it.   I am one of those weird people that likes their frozen coffee to not taste like coffee.  However I left this place wishing I had known about this delicious little treasure before.  I ordered a Frojoe Mocha... and it was the best Frappe I have ever ordered.  Usually when I go to small coffee places like these the Frappe taste exactly like their coffee counterparts except frozen.  This was not like that at all, it was absolutely delicious.    I would say better than Starbucks. If they had one in Fort Worth I would come here every morning for coffee. ", pos 
Dominican Joe ," 6/28/2016 I have been going to to this coffee shop every once in a while for 5 years now.

Dominican Joe ," 12/3/2015 1 check-in If this rating was just based off from the drinks, I would give Dominican Joe 3 stars. But I decided to add another because they have lots of outlets, tables, and fast wifi!  I ordered the popular drink, honey cream latte. Now I came around 3:30 on a Thursday and they weren't really busy. I usually expect some sort of latte art work because I mean, who wouldn't want to have a nice looking latte and show it off cause aesthetically it looks awesome? Unfortunately mine turned out to be a heart-like blob :( The drink itself was honey sweet, and by that I mean not super sweet but subtle enough to balance out a regular latte. It was okay though. My friend ordered their limeade and it was really refreshing. Not as sour as a lemonade, but not super sweet either.  The outside of the building would be great for a photo op. If you were to just look at the exterior, you'd think this would be a more upscale coffee shop. But the interior says so otherwise. Its more on the shabby side (not that its a bad thing), and a local artist happened to stop by to hang up his paintings!    Its a great study spot, which was why I came today. Plenty of outlets along the walls, so if you're not sitting against the wall then bring an extension cord for your laptop. Wifi is also pretty fast here. Wasn't super crowded from 3:30-7:30. Will be coming back! Okay not shitty....but really wanted something cool though :( ", pos 
Dominican Joe ," 11/8/2016 3 check-ins One of my favorite study spots! It's super chill and laid back, nothing too fancy or grandiose, and pretty small on the noise level. The coffee is a bit on the darker side and the sandwiches aren't too bad! Parking is abundant and not that bad of a drive from campus! I think the best part though is the mission of it all! With every purchase, Dominican Joe's gives back a portion to the impoverished areas of the Dominican Republic! What a great cause and great way to give back, sip some hot coffee, and ace that exam!

Dominican Joe , 12/4/2015 2 check-ins Here's the deal. Sometimes their espresso comes out bitter as fuck. And then you want to die. Other times you order a cappuccino and it's good. But for me----the reason I head to DJ's is because of the abundance of tables to choose from with outlets nearby. And their bloody Maria tamale that they carry is the shit. The folks behind the counter are incredibly kind and nice and generous----tip them. :) Mediocre coffee but always a place to sit and decent food options....and great hours. , neutral 
Dominican Joe ," 4/10/2016 1 check-in In the age of avant garde/trendy/hipster-friendly coffee shops, this one matches the bunch. Nothing overly exceptional about the selection, but the menu is concise, and good. The food options do include Torchy's Tacos (YAYYY!!) and a small case not so unlike what you see at other coffee shops.  The big (REALLY BIG) plus about this place is the seating - by which I mean a ton!! Tables, armchairs, patio furniture, benches - both indoors and out - abound as far as the eye can see. Inside, the furnishings feature that distressed wood, ruffled pleather armchair look that you'd find at an off-the-beaten-path (even though this place is right on Congress and Riverside ;) ) joint.  Though I'm not in SoCo/Riverside very often, I'd definitely try this place again considering the positive press they've gotten before. However, the only reason why they don't earn 4-stars from this self-proclaimed Yelp diva just yet is because of the bathroom. I totally understand that one of them was out of order, and it was late on a Sunday morning, but just because your vibe is hipster doesn't mean your bathroom should be (i.e: dirty *cue the bad press*). This of course is a super, super minor detail, which is why Dominican Joe total deserves a second try! Gimme dat large cappuccino tho!!! ", neutral 
Dominican Joe , 10/4/2016 2 check-ins I live on riverside and this is my go to coffee spot in Austin! It's always painless to park which is why I also love the location. My favorite is their iced coffee! I get it weekly along with my Taco Deli migas breakfast taco with doña salsa. Everyone that works here is beyond accommodating and the one time I had an issue with a very burnt taco they refunded me immediately. The only wish I have is that they order more migas tacos because 50% of the time it's a crap shoot if they'll still be available when I come! , pos

I drink it so my mouth can be happy and my nerves can be a wreck! However, with such good coffee, it's worth it!  Their coffee is organic and each cup helps the world. I'm all about that!

Dominican Joe ," 11/4/2015 1 check-in The absolute best thing about this place is that it is LARGE. There are plenty of tables and space and outlets and all the things you need to get your work done. Austin is filled with tiny tiny coffee shops with no parking and no space to work. It's so frustrating to get in there and realize you have to leave!  So, that is the #1 reason Dominican Joe is awesome. So much space. I was there in the afternoon on a weekday, so that was my experience.  My coffee was good. It's really a nice little shopping center very centrally located. It was nice to be able to walk right over to Wells Fargo to get my other work errands finished too.  I also really liked the music. Great music. ", pos

I'm usually just an iced coffee kind of guy, but every once in awhile, I'll dig into one of their lattes. They've got Tacodeli tacos in the morning, which is so clutch, and sometimes they have these homemade peanut butter cups that are delightful and not too rich. The staff are all super cool. Just nice, friendly folks trying to get caffeine into your system with as little hassle as possible. Outstanding. So if I don't wear pants, I get free coffee refills? Score! ", pos

Dominican Joe ," 6/4/2016 Pretty much what you want in an Austin coffee shop - I really enjoyed this place. My roommate and I loved the honey cream latte, which was honey sweet, and by that I mean not overly sweet but subtle enough to balance out the bitter aftertaste of a regular latte. I was here in the winter time with a friend and had this drink hot, but today I got it iced and I enjoyed it just the same! The environment was unpretentious, focused and spacious, with an ambience that was substantiated with music that seemed to complement productivity a opposed to being a distraction (also lots of power outlets!!). Lastly, Dominican Joe works with a non-profit to improve education in the Dominican Republic/Haitian area by buying coffee beans from farmers in that area--if that's not cool enough, I don't know what is. Different types of seating to cater to different needs. Classic desk and chair set up for studying, or couches for lounging purposes ", pos

Dominican Joe ," 9/10/2015 Stopped in the other day to see some friends who were studying their little butts off and enjoyed the atmosphere alright enough. The inside is spacious with lots of tables but none too close together which I liked. Friendly staff. I ordered a iced cafe mocha and honestly thought it tasted more like chocolate milk than coffee. Not to say everything they offer is like that, just my own particular order I suppose. The outside patio seemed great in theory but there were gnats flying around everywhere. Why, Joe, why?!  Point is, I'd go back. I might ask for them to go easy on the mocha next time and stay inside. ;) ", pos

Dominican Joe ," 11/29/2015 Best coffee shop in Austin in my opinion.  It can get pretty busy, which makes it difficult to find a parking spot or a place to sit.  However, once you do, you will be happy you chose this place.  The selection of drinks is amazing and affordable.  They also have music that seems to compliment studying/working rather than being a distraction.  You can also buy their fair trade coffee to take home.

I had a cup of coffee and stayed to talk with a small group for maybe 30 minutes.  The place was pretty packed and it the parking lot was full as well!   It seemed like there were a lot of students inside and not too many large groups so I would not recommend this for large group gatherings.    Also we were sitting near the blender or where they make the drinks so sometimes it became a little loud or difficult to hear each other.  Try to sit on the right side or the side away from the ordering/drink-pick-up place if you plan on having a conversation.    No problem with the drink that I purchased but it was just a normal latte. , neutral 
Dominican Joe ," 1/24/2016 I like coming here to work.  The teas are great and the Bloody Maria is delicious.    I'm not quite as impressed with the service.  I can't say definitively that the staff is friendly or welcoming.  On two occasions, the staff's personal conversations were loud enough to hear throughout the venue, which I'm fine with, so long as the majority of people in the shop aren't trying to do work.

It's hard to explain. Maybe a feeling of superiority by the baristas, or maybe just paranoia that I'm not cool enough. Who knows? I can tell you that I don't like the atmosphere as much as some other local places. It could be due to the anxiety I get when trying to find a parking spot. Who knows?

I'm glad it was the introductory course to all my Austin coffee shop loves because it's definitely one of my regular go-to's.  Dominican Joe is a coffee-shop that works with a non-profit to improve education in the Dominican Republic/Haitian area by buying coffee beans from farmers in that area--if that's not cool enough, I don't know what is.  This place is one of my favorite coffee shops to study--tons of tables, tons of outlets, lots of light, and the music does not overpower your own. Also, they do PayPal, and sometimes PayPal offers that $5/$8 deal for coffee. Free coffee beats all coffee. It does get overcrowded every now and then, but at least there's a parking lot so you don't have to struggle with street parking.  Favorite drink here is the honey cream latte (I often get this mixed with the honey nut latte from Thunderbird...). I really like it although the baristas give me a mix depending on the day--sometimes it's perfect with the perfect amount of espresso. Sometimes, it's a little on the sweeter side/sour side or has too much cinnamon... I wish it was a bit more consistent.  Friendly environment, easy to like if not for coffee, then just for studying.

Barista was super nice to me (an outta towner) and I heard him greet the guy behind me by name, ask about his date the previous night, and wish him a good Sunday morning. I like that in a coffee shop--having your people who know about your life a little. Good juju here. And w a back patio and tacodeli breakfast burritos...what's not to love? Back patio ", pos

There are plenty of tables and outlets, and the wifi is quick.  I am not one for the fancy coffee drinks. My usual is just a drip coffee, so I can't comment on much besides.

There's Starbucks coffee shop good, and then there's ""F-R-I-E-N-D-S."" coffee shop good, and Dominican Joe definitely qualifies for the latter.

I honestly cannot wait until I have an excuse to visit this spot again. Flan Latte is what's up! ", pos 
Dominican Joe ," 1/6/2016 I'm giving them five stars because I had nothing to complain of (although maybe there is, or ought to be, just one more notch to absolute excellence). I went for (a hurried) breakfast and I had a breakfast taco and their honey cream latte. The taco was tasty (and they had four different salsas with it) and that latte was really special, I'd recommend it anytime. I'm not even a sweet coffee drinker and yet it nailed it. Finally, the service was both fast and friendly: they really made me feel at home even in this cold and miserable rainy morning. So, really nothing to complain of! They did make me really happy in an otherwise not too optimistic morning, and that's quite a feat. ", pos

Perhaps it is in the summer but there was no problem finding seats. Plenty of outlets and places to study. The place is pretty spacious and open.  Had some of their tea today. Wasn't bad, but I'm not too picky when it comes to drinks.  The Wifi is pretty nice, no problems. I could even stream videos here with no problem. Great place to study or just chill with friends.

Dominican Joe ," 11/16/2014 Absolutely love this coffee shop. Tried and true austin classic. Plenty of extension cords, small tables for individual work, and is open late. The honey latte is my regular. The flan latte is expectedly a bit sweeter and they sell taco deli breakfast tacos for $2.95. I also enjoy the fact that they offer Paypal mobile: I value businesses that embrace new technologies.  The layout of the location is why I come back. The multiple levels of tables break up conversationalist, studiers, and those in between. It also creates comfy nooks for any time of space you're feeling that day. The light is a bit sparse: mostly dark with spotlights and few floor lights. Because of this, I recommend more for computer work (plentiful plugs) than straight book reading. It can also get very loud since the conversations carry from across the room. The wooden tables/chairs are very warn.  The customer service has always been exceptional here. When I call in, there is always someone to pick up. There have been times where a roudy austin homeless roam nearby or give customers walking in hassle, but give empathy to the baristas! They are not paid to deal with troublemakers, yet they superbly handle them with minimal disturbance to other patrons. Sorry I never got your name, but especially the male barista with a ponytail. Give these people a tip!!!  Btw the coffee tastes good too. ", pos 
Dominican Joe ," 2/19/2015 1 check-in This place was bumpin on a Tuesday afternoon. Like seriously, it was so full of people doing work on their laptops that there were literally no free tables or chairs. We wanted a place we could sit down for a while to rest from walking gazillions of miles around Austin and Dominican Joe looked perfect. But it was packed, so we couldn't sit and hang out. I'm happy they do a booming business! It would be nice if perhaps they had an area without electrical outlets so that there was at least one spot not overrun by people doing work on laptops. That being said, I love a good place to sit and do work so maybe if I were in school here I'd frequent DJ's all the time. Boyfriend's espresso shot was tasty and all the food looked good too.

Their coffee is amazing and the staff there just delightful! They have breakfast tacos daily from TacoDeli (score!) and the best part? Every time you buy a cup of coffee from these local dudes, it benefits kids back in the Dominican Republic (where the coffee is purchased by a local farming community) by putting that money towards education. It's like the TOMS shoe model, only, it's education based.  They have fantastic bakery products like banana bread (my favorite) as well as bagels and smoothies. No complaints on this place.

Dominican Joe ," 11/8/2014 1 check-in THIS IS MY 100th REVIEW.  I am also glad that it is on a place like Dominican Joes.  Ambiance:  This is really the only reason I come here.  It has a lot of space, and a lot of other people with their nose to the grindstone.  Its centrally located and people are in and out quickly.  The tables are worn, the chairs are damaged and wobbly but that doesn't keep me away from wanting to go back here over and over again.  The place is clean and friendly.  You never quite feel cramped either.  There is probably some way to put in a couple more tables in here, but they try to keep it a Little less cramped.  Also, there is a very under utilized patio type area that is super nice and has plants kind of surrounding it.  It is very nice, but its probably not used as much because there are no plugs for laptops out there.    Food:  Overpriced and of course, coffee type food.  Everything is too expensive here, but sometimes I purchase stuff here anyway.  Its kinda highway robbery, but they can totally get away with it.   I honestly don't drink coffee, so I couldn't tell you how I feel about it.  Access:  The place use to get me all upset about not being able to park.  But honestly, wait about 5 min and someone is leaving always.  If you are patient, you never have a problem here,  finding a spot to park.  Although often.  99% of the parking spots are filled.  Getting in and out I would say is not 100% easy, but its enough to be ok.  Just be careful going through the parking lot. ", pos

Dominican Joe ," 10/27/2013 1 check-in Ok, so I normally rate coffee shops for their coffee...but after multiple late nights of coffee intoxication...my system needed a break while I was having a work meeting. I tried one of their smoothies and it was absolutely excellent! The service was wonderful as well. Extremely friendly and fast from an absolutely ""Austinee"" group. Loved it.  There was ample seating from small tables to a high top bar in back to booths etc. Lots of options to accommodate a large variety of people. I would say my biggest complaint was parking. I know that's not really the coffee shops fault....but it made it really hard to get there. Not sure how they can fix it, but it affected my visit.  I'll be sure to stop in again soon and actually try a mocha or something so I can provide them with a higher rating. ", neutral 
Dominican Joe ," 7/9/2015 Hipster vibe, with a relaxed ambience. I love their coffee which is strong and bold and I like it like that.

Dominican Joe , 7/11/2014 1 check-in Listed in Hipster Coffee Shops Dominican Joe's has a ton of potential- their coffee concoctions are truly delicious.  My friend loved her mocha and I loved my Honey Cream Latte . . . after letting it cool down for freaking 30 minutes.  There's absolutely no reason to make your coffee so hot that it's burn-your-tongue-fucking-hot-as-fuck for half an hour.  It also didn't help that the barista was slow as hell and that they only have disposable paper cups instead of real coffee mugs.  I guess I just expect a lot more if I'm paying $5 for a coffee/espresso drink.    le sigh :\  but the drinks ARE good! , neutral

Dominican Joe ," 7/2/2014 So, I was having a day that required chocolate in mass quantities. I decide that a frozen coffee treat is what I really want. Instead of doing the Starbucks drive through thing, I want to support local business, so I go here.  First, none of the employees even looked at me when I went up to the counter. In a few moments, a lady walks over and takes my order. She then proceeds to bitch to the guy working on something behind the counter about how she hates making blended drinks. She says nothing to me. I'm standing right there, scowling now.  She makes the drink and gives it to me. I decided to get a cookie too. Like I said, I needed chocolate. She rings me up and when I sign for the credit card, I leave no tip. I almost put a big zero in the tip section, but that seemed super rude. I can be crabby, but I try not to be purposefully rude.  Anyhow, the drink was just ""meh"" and, the dang cookie was burnt. That $8+ is not easy to come by for me. This was a special treat. I had to use credit, after all.  I know that working with the public sucks. I'm sure being on your feet all day for crap wages is no fun. We've all got bills to pay. I'm sorry if your life sucks, but be nice. Geez. Food service is like acting.  I saw her look at the tip line before I left, but I didn't wait around to see her expression. What did you do to deserve a tip?  At least they are friendly at Starbucks.

It is fairly well hidden off of Bee Caves Rd in a shopping center.

The team here is friendly and helpful. No snobby baristas here! There is local merch, coffee contraptions for purchase, local bites, Topo Chico/Clean water/Pellegrino, fruit, a huge variety of teas, coffee (both brewed to order and ready made) and more. There are about 45 types of beans you can purchase to go with a nice selection of both organic and decaf sprinkled in.  I asked what they could do decaf and was told they can do anything decaf except or ice coffee. Well that is impressive!

Every time I go, I have a nice little conversation with them and they are courteous. The coffee shop has great seating too and a meeting room that you can reserve.  They don't really make food there but they have food from local vendors there so you can get a sandwich or a wrap.

Pros: * Feels like you're *somewhere* ... this isn't a stand-up faux style coffee place that could be built anywhere using a helicopter and some glue.  Someone cares about this place and it definitely belongs here. * So far good coffee, their London Fog was excellent. * If you want to get work done, there are plenty of places to plug in and Internet is faster than other places in the area (this includes Starbucks).  Cons: * On more than one occasion, the Wifi went off and asking the employees to restart the router didn't help.  I generally go to coffee shops like this to get some work done so I need a good connection. * Make sure you check the hours.  I've been caught off guard by this multiple times. * Standard iced tea so far has just been okay.  They really need to come correct on this during the middle of the summer.  Other notes (neither good nor bad): * Some of the staff are talkers and very engaging. * Coffee used is (claimed to be) roasted here in Austin for those of you that want to champion the home team. * Some food options if you get hungry.

Trianon Coffee , 1/21/2014 1 check-in There are plenty of coffee shops in this town and we have another that I can check off my list. What makes this one cool is that they have their own coffee bean shop on the side of the counter to take home. The baristas are friendly and knowledgable and there ample seating. The crowd is a little more on the older side but coffee is coffee. Wifi is wifi. Available seating is available seating.  It's good to know this is here. When I'm in the area. I'll stop in and contribute to the local coffee scene and grab my Americano. , pos 
Trianon Coffee ," 8/9/2015 This place has excellent coffee! They also have a huge selection of fresh coffee beans to choose from.

Trianon Coffee ," 7/21/2015 Awesome coffee chop. Great environment, I love to go here and just read a book for hours. The employees are extremely nice. I brought my broken french press there once and the people talked me through using it and fixing it. They also know a TON about coffee and are very engaging in talking to you about it.  Just wish they were open even later, but when they ARE open, they're wonderful. ", pos 
Trianon Coffee ," 10/28/2014 We recently moved to the area and this is our new favourite local, it's just between school and house so perfect for those mornings when the child needs a steamed milk to function.  The decent Latte doesn't do me any harm either, my request for a 'medium latte with one shot'  is always treated with politeness rather than disdain.      On the days when I have to drag the  boy out of the bed I can use the phrase 'You know if we were earlier we could go to Trianon'. Works like a charm, every time.  The Baristas are unfailing kind to a small child that asks lots of questions and his 'one shot, please' wimp of a mother,  which makes them superior beings in my book.  The staff are smart, witty and good natured.  What's not to love about a place with good coffee,  comfy seats and good people? ", pos 
Trianon Coffee ," 1/16/2014 2 check-ins One of my favorite coffee spots in town.  Hidden away in the heart of Westlake, Trianon is usually pretty quiet and a good place to read a book or enjoy a quiet conversation with a pal.  The baristas are all wonderful people.  They are knowledgeable about the drinks and coffees they offer.  They readily will offer you great suggestions that fit your personality instead of referring to the most expensive, boring thing on the menu.  I really enjoy the mocha frappes.  They have a pretty good flavor and are much richer-tasting than your typical Starbucks fare.  It just tastes more real.  I've been coming here a lot lately- so much so my mom got me a gift card to the place for Christmas.  My only real ""complaint"" is that they close super early.  I like enjoying coffee in the evenings and they usually close up shop around 7pm or so most nights.  Otherwise, I love this place and wish there were more coffeehouses like it out there. ", pos 
Trianon Coffee ," 4/8/2014 Great place when the internet is working. Recently Tbird has had some issues with that. Tomato basil and smoked salmon sandwiches are exceptional and the honey nut latte can't be beat.  Atmosphere is good with lots of seating outside. Sometimes hard to get a seat inside.  Pet peeve: The music is totally dependent on who is working. The loud rap is not appreciated, this is a coffee shop... music should be kept in the background. ", neutral 
Trianon Coffee , 12/27/2014 We go here nearly every morning.  We like the neighborhood feel and I like the coffee better than the chain stores.  They have almond milk options which is a plus.  All the staff is very friendly and they remember our names and orders. , pos 
Trianon Coffee ," 8/13/2012 23 check-ins Holy mother of holy----things. I just took a gulp of something I can only describe as a heavenly elixir of sweet, nerve-jolting deliciousness. (The ""flavored"" latte--which I chose caramel and mocha flavoring.)  I have recently accepted a position at a place where I will be working ungodly late nights and overnights and in the meanwhile...also attending daytime training. These days, I normally don't drink coffee (unlike my 18 year old self who used to drink mochas with 4 extra shots added to it.....3 times a day....yeah)...but seeing as I'm training for a management level position....me being the swamp creature in the back of the training classes who is moaning and muttering incoherently due to sleep depravation is wholly unacceptable.  Enter Trianon. I stumbled in at 8:40 on a Saturday and ordered....are you ready for this bc it's ridiculous...""a 20oz caramel/mocha flavored latte with almond milk."" The young lady behind the counter was sweet as she took my order and the badass who executed the order should just be glad I didnt try my drink inside the store...or else she would have seen me bounce over the counter to lay a wet one on her. That's what everyone at a coffee shop needs, right? Unwanted sexual advancements/harassment ??  You know how sometimes, when you're at the office and someone who thinks they know how to make coffee...makes the coffee? And when you drink it...it's like drinking water with coffee flavoring? And sometimes, you'll get a cup of coffee and just be wildly underwhelmed by it's lack of boldness?? WELL...I will say this much....the ""Shot in the dark"" drink (coffee with a shot of espresso)....is truly not satisfying taste-wise. It was just a bit too blah for me...which I think speaks to the quality of the black coffee that they have on drip (And I got their dark roast drip). That's my nugget of full disclosure for this review.  They do have Taco Deli tacos (none of which I observed were vegan friendly---they did have vegetarian friendly ones though)....and a conference room you can rent out. Awesome.  So, thank you Trianon the Coffee Place---Now I can fool my coworkers into thinking I'm a sort of superwoman with boundless amounts of energy....and keep it on the down-low that I'm actually downing liquid crack from your establishment as my secret energy source. ", pos 
Trianon Coffee ," 9/24/2013 Just discovered this place after living in the area for 2 years, mainly because the name of the establishment leads one to believe it is a Fleetwood Mac-inspired chemotherapy manufacturer, rather than a coffee shop.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that instead of expensive cytotoxin, these folks were churning out a barista blend of coffee that rivals some of the best stuff I make at home (I'm looking at you, Gevalia.)  Prices are reasonable, and the clientele demographics lean more toward moderately frigid white people than the agonizingly narcissistic elitists that sit directly behind you and bitch about the fact that Austin is an ""elegantly dressed whore masquerading as it's former self"".

Trianon Coffee ," 6/6/2012 1 check-in This ""coffee place"" brings back a lot of memories. Back in middle school we could always smell Trianon from down the hill brewing their coffee. It was so nice!  It has a fantastic location and a lot of seating. They even have a private ""conference room"" where you can get work done or schedule meetings if you want a private space.  I like sitting with my laptop at one of their many little tables. There are windows all around so it has a lot of natural light and the counter is big and inviting. The baristas are always very friendly as well.  They sell Tacodeli tacos, but this isn't a plus for me because when I opened mine the flour tortilla was completely stuck to the tin foil... womp womp. But that's ok, I'll just get them fresh from Tacodeli. They also have some assorted pastries and to-go lunch sandwiches and wraps.  I loved their chai tea latte with an extra shot of espresso, so yummy!  The prices seem to be pretty standard as well.  Me gusta Trianon! ", pos 
Trianon Coffee ," 5/17/2014 1 check-in I chose Trianon as a business meeting spot one afternoon for location, mostly, and enjoyed a very pleasant experience all-around.  Their prices are probably half or less compared to Starbucks and delicious, made even more complete with foam art on the lattes--a choice on the part of a talented barista who takes an extra few moments to be thoughtful and creative.  I've been in Trianon about four times since the first visit, and three of those four, I was helped by one of the same employees who remembered my name after the first visit.  That's kind of rare, especially considering the erratic timing of my visits.  Anyway, I ordered a small soy vanilla hot latte, and really enjoyed it:  it was not bitter, nor too sweet, and I found the foam to be near-perfect--not bubbly like some places like to try to pass off as foam, but rich, lathery, frothy milk.  Their foam is the kind I want to take a piece of biscotti or a spoon and eat up once finished with the coffee,    I wish there were a few more cushy seating options, but for the space, I think the seating is pretty ample, and I enjoy how Austin-y this place is.  There always seems to be someone in there with a guitar and a laptop, writing music.  I haven't brought my laptop in to test out the wifi and get inspired, but that's something I'd like to do.  I appreciate the sense of community the place encourages by offering a meeting space for small groups needing only to be reserved ahead of time.    I would like to try some of their other baked goods and sandwiches, and that's on my to-do list in Westlake, in general, and most certainly at Trianon again.  It's a place that must surely be many folks' favorite place. ", pos 
Trianon Coffee ," 10/18/2014 1 check-in I work nearby and this coffee shop looks popular, so I decided to use my free small coffee coupon here. Anyways, the staff was friendly in making my selection and I did enjoy my small coffee but I wish I didn't have to buy my pumpkin bread to get a small coffee for free. The girl after me got a small coffee for free and she didn't have to buy anything so I thought that was unfair. ", neutral 
Trianon Coffee ," 6/29/2011 Trianon Coffee is an attractive space with friendly faces at the counter. Westlake moms can drive in and out and grab what they need quickly and keep going. I'm no Westlake mom, and I wasn't in a rush, but my coffee was yummy this morning.  The food offerings are the same you see in all the other shops: meatless TacoDeli tacos (thanks to the city ordinance that prevents third-party vendors from selling non-vegetarian tacos), Mary Louise Butters brownies (designed for long shelf life but consistently decent), Quacks pastries and baked goods (saliva-producing-in-excelsis).  I've been to Trianon only a couple of times. My visit today was marred by a faint but persistent offensive smell (from the bathrooms?) that made me wolf my muffin and skedaddle. Also, there was no simple syrup out on the condiment table. When it's 100 degrees at 10 a.m. and I'm drinking iced coffee, putzing around with packets of sugar and a wooden stirrer isn't really how I want to spend my sweet time. ", neutral 
Trianon Coffee ," 8/15/2014 The coffee is good, atmosphere is good, the service is good & it is local.  They serve there drinks in real mugs if your sticking around.

Trianon Coffee , 10/7/2014 Cute coffee place with friendly service. It wasn't too busy when I went in on a Saturday afternoon. The main pros are that they have cold-brewed iced coffee and offer almond milk as an option. The only downside I noticed is a lack of comfortable seating. , neutral

Trianon Coffee ," 4/30/2012 Bee Caves and West Lake Hills just boast the most rustic looking buildings, but the interior always seem to go above and beyond. In this specific shopping center, you have a clean-cut bagel shop, a cutesy bakery, a quality bread company, and well... Trianon fits right into that demographic.  Inside, there is a huge amount of seating, and the menu is pretty expansive, with food offerings coming from the local forefront, of course. Coffee comes in a variety of sizes and styles, and they brew a couple of house coffees a day. Good stuff, all across the board.  Pricing is fairly standard, but the location is what really sets it apart. Smack dab between downtown and the thick of Westlake, Trianon serves as a superb place at which to rendezvous for individuals who need to do business or simply catch up on life. Inviting and warm ambiance.  I don't know how this joint doesn't pop up more on the Yelp feed, but I guess it has a settled down spot across MoPac where everything seems to move at a slower place, no? ", pos

Trianon Coffee ," 10/20/2013 I like this place a lot! The staff is extremely friendly and helpful. Two of them went to the effort of walking me through their (large) coffee selection and also provided me with some free samples to taste. I don't think I've ever gotten that level of service from any other coffee shop. I also really like that they do not have loud music blaring like too many other coffee shops. It's a relatively quiet place where I can get some work done. They have a conference room you can reserve, which is a neat feature for a coffee shop.  I've given 4/5 stars, since I haven't yet been there enough to fully assess the quality of the coffee. If after a few more trips I decide it's up to scratch, I'll upgrade it to 5. ", pos

I grabbed an iced coffee using their yelp check-in deal (which was definitely a plus!) The coffee itself was pretty good. It seems like a nice place to chill or maybe just grab a quick cup to go. They also have a pretty large meeting room with a whiteboard. The location is a little strange- a small homey coffee shop in a bunch of suburban shopping centers. They have a really big menu, lots of things to choose from. They have some baked goods, tacos from Taco Deli in the morning, and some pre-wrapped sandwiches. The staff seemed very friendly and was very helpful! I'm not so sure on some of the types of beans that they offer for wholesale- it looks like a lot of flavored stuff.

Great place to meet for small meetings in the general coffee area, or to spend the afternoon reading.  And all that coffee brewing makes the place smell great. ", pos 
Trianon Coffee ," 1/5/2011 This is one of my favorite place to chill with my laptop when I'm not in the office.  The chairs are comfy, outlets are plentiful, people are friendly, and the drinks are generally decent.  If they know you're going to hang around, you can get your tea in a giant stoneware mug.  The best way to describe the atmosphere is casual.  There is no pressure to be hip and wear pants that are too small.  They don't even care if you don't know or care about coffee.  And I see very few Macs.  Tacodeli tacos are there in the mornings, but most importantly there are The Cinnamon Rolls.  I'm not sure where they come from, but Trianon, Texenza on Brodie, and Lola Savannah have them.  They sell out fast, but they are the most delicious cinnamon rolls I've ever tasted.  I don't think they are yeast rolls...they taste more like pastry dough that has been rolled in cinnamon sugar and two pounds of butter.  Unfortunate things would happen if I ate them all the time, but luckily they sell out quickly enough to keep me from puffing up like a blimp and floating away. ", pos 
Trianon Coffee , 2/4/2011 2 check-ins I will certainly go to Triannon before I go to Starbuck's.  They've been in Westlake for many years now.  I go there for beans infrequently because their prices are pretty steep.  They have some decent snacks to have with your coffee. , neutral

They only serve vegetarian tacos from Taco Deli, so if you need meat, well... get one anyway. :)  I've never sat down and enjoyed my coffee, but there are tons of chairs and tables, and tons of merchandise to peruse.

If you like a place when you can get in and get out quickly so you aren't late for work, go there.  If you like a place where you can sit down, relax, enjoy your coffee and internet surf or read, go there.  If you like a place that feels like home, where you are greeted by friends, most definitely--go to Trianon!  Their selection of coffees are amazing--so flavorful and rich!  I'm passionate about their Bavarian coffee but the coffees from around the world are also tasty!   I often get the regular coffee of the day, but I usually treat myself to one or two cappuccinos a week.  Seriously, the baristas KNOW how to produce the most glorious foam you ever had atop your cappuccino.  So much so, I really don't like having them anywhere else!  My family also goes after church on Sunday- they love to get the  latte, macchiato, and mochas--all wonderful.  What's great is with my handy Trianon card, I can pop in and out quickly in the mornings before work.  They swipe my purchase quickly and send me on my way!  And if you get there early enough, you can get those yummy Tacodeli tacos too!  The best thing BY FAR about Trianon is the wonderful people there.  The baristas are so talented and so very, very friendly and sweet.   When you walk in, they are always so welcoming. They really help make my day a brighter, happier one!

They roasted their own beans, and had great employees and the coffee was wonderful.  (They did have way too many baskets all over the place for some reason... didn't care for that)  Then some people from Colorado came to town and bought the business... and fired those great employees... and got rid of the coffee bean roasting... and started making crappy coffee :( And I stopped going there.  Now, those people from Colorado are gone, there's a new local owner, the same coffee roaster from before is back (even though they can no longer roast their own beans on site) and the coffee is amazingly good again!  The iced mochas are especially good. Definitely my favorite iced mocha in town.  Hooray for good coffee and people that care about it.

I was overwhelmed by her commitment to customer satisfaction. I normally don't complain about such things and rarely write reviews, but this experience really underscored what a great establishment Trianon is.  I also just love how quirky it is.

Trianon Coffee ," 7/27/2011 I just love this place. I never need to hang out so I always take to-go. Therefore, what I love about it is the customer service I have received. It only took approximately 3-4 visits before each barista remembered what I ordered and my first name. The manager Brendon goes out of his way to make each customer feel special. They move quickly and always have at least 2 people working so one can make drinks and one can check out. The coffee is fine. I'm not a coffee connoisseur by any means but their double espresso shot does me just fine. I like to support local business so regardless of taste, I will still choose over Starbucks.  The ambiance is just so-so. That is my only reason for 4 stars. It could be cozier & a bit more modern. It kind of feels like a cafeteria. It's very bright & cold.

Do I rate it how it was years and years ago when a really cool Austin couple owned it? When they roasted their own beans, when they had their own coffee, when they knew my mom (I'd go with her, since she bought her coffee there and I'd go along).  Or do I rate them now? Now that *I* go there and buy my coffee there? (mom's not in Austin anymore)  Now that they're not locally-owned anymore (thanks, Scooter's), now that they don't roast their own?    I'll compromise and go for 3.  Used to be the same people all the time. Like the family coffee place. Almost always someone new in there these days. Customer service is no longer stellar (yes, it used to be stellar).  A few did try to help me with my espresso problems (problems with the machine and beans), and one guy is often there. But, honestly, I seem like a burden to some of the baristas.  I still go there out of convenience (and also because after a certain number of pounds of coffee, you get one free). I'd rather support them than Starbucks. But I am able to buy coffee in ""bulk,"" so I like that.  While waiting, I love perusing the chocolates. I want to try them all!    So, I go out of loyalty and because I can buy in bulk...at least until I find another place where I can buy ground coffee.  ***Update*** I'm glad to hear Trianon is family-owned again. Last time I went, someone was helpful with my coffee woes.  Although hesitant to go back, I did. What can I say? I'm loyal.  The barista who helped me today was really helpful--well, so far. I haven't had a chance to try the new grind yet on my coffee. But she knew the machines (espresso) and seemed to know what to do with my concerns.

Trianon Coffee ," 7/1/2010 Trianon is a cutesy coffee shop off Bee Caves. If you're familiar with the Coffee Bean, it's similar to that, but a little less corporate feeling. They have a small conference room, which is unique. They sell tons of coffee-related items - coffee beans, french press machines, huge coffee mugs, toddy accessories, etc! They also sell cute little chocolate truffles and candy! The inside is pretty spacious (but no couches), and there are a few tables outside. The iced mocha was surprisingly good. I've been sipping on it for over an hour and it's not watery or gross at all. They also have hemp milk, if you're a real hippie. ", neutral

Trianon Coffee ," 2/15/2010 Props to Trianon for the great places to sit, friednly baristas the only coffee shop I've seen that (yes) allows people to use a conference room (!!) and keeping the music at the right volume level that allows folks to work.  Knocks for not enough places to plug in my laptop, and the better-than-average-but-not-uber-great-drip coffee.  I may drink decaf, but I like it STRONG.  The macchiato was up to par, though.  (oh, and a demerit to the three women who just sat near me to have a meeting without apologizing...)  This is definitely a place where the work-from-home, small-biz types schedule meetings and get it done - kinda cool that the coffee shop accommodates, even celebrates it! ", pos 
Trianon Coffee ," 11/11/2006 First to Review Listed in Best Cup of Joe We buy our office coffee en masse here at Trianon, so the staff has many times witnessed me running through their doors to grab pounds of Panama, only to run out breathlessly en route to the TCBY next door to grab the office's frozen yogurt requests.  Point being, every time I run in, I have this incredible urge to drop my self in one of their sun-lit corner tables, bust out my laptop and stay awhile. The feel here is cozy and relaxed, the mainly female staff is always friendly, and their unique selection of candy, treats, and specialty coffee is unbelievably tempting. European truffles, candy-bar flavored coffee, and day-old baked goods at 50% off. While they prepare your order, sneak over to the retail section and peruse the coffee lovers' necessities. My only complaint about Trianon is their daily trivia question. If you get it right, you get 10 cents off your order. 10 cents?! Straining my brain to come up with the answer is worth at least a dollar.  Stop by and try a cup of their Panama blend. Best I've tasted in Austin. ", pos 
Trianon Coffee ," 10/3/2009 Listed in Caffeination Stations I judge a good coffee place on their iced coffee. It's my favorite, and I will order it in the dead of winter in a blizzard.

We are now locally and family owned again!  We have a new roaster, and the coffee is GREAT.  Drink it here, buy coffee for home, whatever-- it's great.

I stated yes and was recommended by someone to try the butter coffee so I ordered that. I had it iced and it was a bit strong. I was reading other reviews stating it was sweet...mine was not sweet. Maybe I just needed to ask to sweeten it but it still tasted good.  I went back today on a break from work and wanted to try something else. I got the chorizo frittata and it was good even though it was small. I also ordered the dirty chai (hot) and it tastes so good and I'm content with it.  I am definitely coming back to try out the others. , pos

Verdict: Delicious, creamy and very enjoyable! I'm also a fan of their customer service and general vibe. Thanks Picnik!

You can really taste the marshmallow flavoring mixed with the chai tea, and it's something I've never had before.

This place was such coolness! We visited for a quick snack while we were waiting for a table to open up at Snooze across the parking lot. I am so glad we did.  One side of the menu is devoted entirely to coffee drinks. Each drink can be made as is, or iced. The other side of the menu has things like pastries, breakfast tacos, and even sandwiches! There's also bone broth. My goodness the menu made me want to cry. All the things that you know you will probably botch if you make at home can be ordered here! It's just amazing. I would love to come back and try everything on the menu.  I ordered the Marshmallow Chai which had grass-fed butter, MCT oil, rooibos tea, maple syrup, grass-fed collagen, grass-fed colostrum & grass-fed whey protein. I added a shot of coffee (no extra charge, yay!). I could just feel the goodness flowing through by body! There's free water too which is a nice touch, and the patio is dog-friendly--coolness!  Only caveat is that some of the items were a bit pricy. But you certainly get what you pay for. At least here you know what's in your food, and know that it is of the highest quality! ", pos 
Picnik Austin ," 7/23/2016 4 check-ins For all you health fanatics or foodies who want to try something different, this is a place for you. Picnik specializes in paleo, which I have done briefly and I lost a bit of weight. It is a storage container located on the lawn of 1700 S Lamar. There's limited seating and I went from seating on a bench to sitting on table. To tell you the truth, it shouldn't be an issue. Heck why not sit on the steps or on the grass and make a picnik out of it.  I picked up a menu and wasn't too sure what to order because it was all so good. I ran ten miles beforehand and I was ready to eat everything in sight. Ironically I didn't want to try the Butter Coffee because my eye was on the Mayan Mocha. I rarely get a mocha because I'm just into having coffee and not having and fancy espresso drinks. Then for breakfast I had the Chorizo Fritatta and a blueberry muffin. They were small portions. But strangely enough, it was filling. I always think to myself I need to come here more often to try other things they offer in the menu.  Parking is tricky since it's in a busy strip mall but worth checking out. Mexican Mocha Chorizo Frittata and a Blueberry muffin ", pos

The chicken dish was pretty small and thankfully half off, because I wouldn't have liked to spend $11.50 for that small of a portion.  I might come back and try the breakfast options one day.

It was super light and satisfied my sweet tooth- without the guilt.  The zucchini muffins were also great!  I've noticed with some Paleo desserts, they tend to be dry.  Not these!

However, I would like to offer up a suggestion based on the ""Great Stew Tragedy of 2016"" aka Today.  I was so excited to see that soup was back on the menu and happily ordered a large stew that I was going to eat for lunch.  I was reveling in the joy that was going to be my lunch when the Paleo Gods noticed my pride and took action. It turns out that the top was not secured on my container and as I traveling to work, the yummy goodness was slowly leaking out with every turn.  As I was retrieving my bag from the car, the bottom fell out from the leakage.  While the delicious smelling stew ended up on my car floor ( thank goodness for rubber floor mats), unfortunately, none of will end up in my mouth.  Which leads to my suggestion.  Perhaps, you could use tape or rubber bands to secure the lids a la  Whole Foods so that deliciousness is not wasted on unworthy floor mats.

Picnik Austin ," 10/24/2016 My boyfriend and I went for brunch on Sunday. I ordered the two daily specials they had going on: french toast and the other was cinnamon rolls baked with apple; I also ordered the dirty chai. He decided on one of their breakfast tacos and a side of steamed veggies with pineapple cider.  The dirty chai was fantastic, and I'm not even much of a coffee drinker! Coffee is definitely their specialty and it shows in the value of their drinks. The french toast was adequate, filling, and presentable. The blueberries and strawberries were fresh as can be and the cream cheese was a nice addition. My only issue with them was that they were a little burnt on the bottom, but thankfully that didn't take away from the overall flavor too much.  Unfortunately, the cinnamon rolls were a disappointment. For $7, I received two dry, bland, cold pastries half the size of my palms (and I have small hands). This would have been acceptable if it weren't for their absurd price.  According to him, the breakfast taco was tasty. But it was only one, small taco for $8 and didn't even include the side (which was an extra $7). It would be nice if they at least included two tacos. I understand this is a diet-focused restaurant, but that's a bit of a premium for an appetizer portion.  To summarize, I highly recommend this place for their drinks. Their coffee is unique and tastes incredible! I'll definitely return for my caffeine fix. But don't come here to eat unless you like paying for overpriced, mediocre snacks. ", neutral 
Picnik Austin ," 4/14/2016 1 check-in Listed in Cafes, ¡Olé! The first time I heard about the Paleo diet, I was speaking to an ox of a man. He actually grunted fairly frequently, talking about how it was the perfect way for a guy like him to shed the pounds and still, like, harness chains to his nostrils. The second guy was in his 60's, my bug control guy, he'd lost about 80 pounds in less than six months and his arthritis, which made it nearly impossible for him to pull the trigger of the organic bug killin' juice bottle, had virtually disappeared. That's when I decided I should learn a little more about the whole Paleo thing.  During a ""coffee & tea"" Yelp app search, Picnik popped up as the closest option to our Air BnB. We actually drove through the parking lot, twice, looking for what turned out to be a trailer on a hill helmed by a bunch of sort of purer-than-thou people, in a really good way. Like, their skin radiated and they smiled and authentically wanted to educate us on the anti-arthritis way to live, and they would absolutely be the first cave dwellers to parish, should those days return. The butter coffee was like buttah, baby; we kept coming back for more. Get the mocha. And get a muffin. Our five year-old didn't dig it, but if you let her be your culinary guide, you'd essentially live on quesadilla and blackberries. I, on the other hand, found the muffin rather brilliant, considering it was crafted by a bunch of folks using spearheads and flints. ", pos

Picnik Austin ," 8/17/2015 Listed in ATX - Potpourri Paleo for the people.  I fully buy into the idea of paleo eating. It just makes too much sense (don't knock it until you've actually read what it's all about). Because this is the way I eat about 80% of the time (love ice cream too much, bruh), it's a godsend to have an eatery like Picnik that ensures everything on their menu passes the sniff test.  I found them after doing a search for ""butter coffee"" on Yelp. Being that I drink a cup of BP coffee every morning, I wanted to keep my habits alive while on vacation. Some may argue that cavemen weren't drinking coffee laced with butter and high concentrations of cold pressed coconut oil. I don't really care about your argument, I just like the stuff. And Picnik has so many different varieties to choose from.  I went with the mocha flavor on both of my weekend trips. Butter, MCT oil, cacao powder, cacao butter, and a little vanilla whey protein. I've had the tried and true butter + MCT oil several times, but this upped the ante so hard. I'll have to figure out a way to incorporate cacao powder into more cups here in New York.  I also swooped up a cacao cupcake with grass fed butter cream and a tuna sandwich. The former was delicious, the latter not so much. But it's not necessarily their fault - very few paleo breads should be used for anything but shingling a roof. But if you want a fantastic cup of coffee and a dessert, you're in luck.

Paleo--meaning nothing processed, think of yourself as a cave man. Could you have eaten pizza, well no, certainly not. (and you shouldn't be now, but it's so good... I'm digressing)  This is the place to go  if you've wondered about the infamous bullet coffee (Navy Seals, paleo coffee, butter coffee, etc--all sorts of lore out there)  They make the stuff with all organic ingredients.  Places like this are why we now see advertisements for Kerry Gold butter from Ireland on the telly now.  Who had ever heard of the stuff before butter coffee?  (those cows live the high life and only eat sweet, green, grass)  Whip the butter with the organic coffee, add some MCT oil (read up--it's amazing) and then add some interesting sweeteners.  I'm highly susceptible to caffeine, but didn't find myself blasting through space.  What I did have however, was a very sated hunger and a long, even energy buzz.  I'm liking this stuff.  There are rumors of weight loss!!  To be fair, I didn't try any of the food, but I love the paleo concept and I'll definitely grab and go from this nice food truck.  And, I'll feel good afterwards because there is no wheat flour (Listen up GF's!), they compost and recycle, and they serve that coffee out of cups made from veggies, not trees.  Oh, and they love my doggie too.  I love you Piknik, thank you for fighting the good fight. ", pos 
Picnik Austin ," 11/3/2015 Updated review 2 check-ins Updated review: while their redesign looks cool, you can't see the food or anything they're selling. I went for a packaged salad and paid $16.29 with tax. Quality wise - the dressing was amazing however the salad itself was pretty small with not a lot of greens and a small piece of chicken. Needless to say I'm still hungry. The ingredients they use are great - high quality and healthy, but you can have a sit down meal at bouldin with a drink and tip and pay less and the ingredients are just as fresh and healthy. I'll still probably pop in every now and then for a coffee.  They have really good food, but it's a bit pricey. My favorite is the shrimp and pineapple salad, please bring it back! So good. Favorite drink there is the little Larry, it's really good iced or hot. You can also buy protein, Chapstick, and other paleo goodies while there. The staff is always friendly. ", neutral

Picnik Austin ," 6/28/2016 Updated review Not so good experience. Ordered 2 iced butter coffees and my partner and I both reeeeally disliked them. I kept taking sips to try to enjoy it but it tasted awful to me- like a weirdly velvety fruit juice... I asked if I could try something of equal value and the employee seemed very annoyed and told me ""if you didn't like that, you're not going to like anything else."" I said ""well can I try the banana ice cream?"" (Or whatever the frozen banana bowl is called) and she seemed so reluctant and annoyed and was like ""ok but it's gonna be a while."" So I waited a while, finally tried the bananas, and it had a lukewarm and mucous-y texture. Disappointed cause I really wanted to like this place.

The 12 oz. butter coffee + collagen is my go-to, and if I've been a good little exerciser, I splurge on a butter blondie to go with that. It's my favorite place! I can't tell you how many people I've turned onto Picnik.  I wish I didn't have to write this on Yelp, but I couldn't find any other place to contact the business directly. I went in this past week, clutching my loyalty card as I always do, and was told that the loyalty program had changed. Whereas I used to get a punch toward a free coffee every time I bought a coffee, now I will ONLY get a punch IF I spend $7.25 in a single visit. So, basically, I could come to Picnik 365 days a year and get my regular 12 oz butter coffee with collagen and NEVER qualify for a free beverage. I was so disappointed and in disbelief that one of my favorite businesses would alienate its regular customers in this way. To make matters worse, the cashier took my half full paper card and didn't give it back, not allowing me to join the new program since I hadn't spent $7.25 that day.  They don't HAVE to offer a loyalty program - I totally get that! But changing the existing program to exclude their most loyal customers felt really inconsiderate to me, and I felt alienated and disappointed. I really wish this hadn't happened. Now I think twice about giving them my business, since it seems like they only care about customers who spend $7.25 vs. customers who spend between $6-$7 multiple times per week. ", pos 
Picnik Austin ," 7/4/2016 This is such a good place to have for paleo people. Everything here is paleo, which is so rare. Every single time I go the people who work there are super friendly and helpful. The prices are a bit high, but I continue to go because the food is good and I know I can always eat paleo here. The breakfast tacos are great, but I think the star is the blondie brownie. It's so delicious! ", pos 
Picnik Austin ," 3/5/2016 Wow. Holy goodness and all PALEO!!! My heart smiled as I read through their menu. To add to my internal butterflies, the food was amazing!!! I'm normally a ""hot"" person so was a little skeptical of cold packaged paleo food but my lord, it was so yummy! Super filling too!  We got the carnitas tacos, spaghetti squash lasagna and bone broth. I will be back again and again. Love that there's a place that caters to the paleo lifestyle. ", pos 
Picnik Austin ," 3/26/2016 Delicious Food.  First time here, we ordered the tacos, spaghetti squash and broccoli but unfortunetly they were out of the tacos and squash!  The only item left besides the broccoli was the Tuna Salad wrap and it was delicious!!! The Broccoli was excellent too, very satisfying, great mix of sweet currants and salty bacon. Our 20 mth old and 4 year old loved the tuna and broccoli. Great place, friendly staff!! ", pos 
Picnik Austin ," 3/22/2016 I got a salmon salad collard wrap and a butter brownie and it was the cat's pajamas!  The wrap came with crunchy red grapes which paired so well with the savory wrap.  It wasn't a huge amount of food but very filling and satisfying!  I will be back. A lot.  I also love the vibe there. The employees are so cheerful and helpful. Their Instagram is also awesome, gives a nice peek into their business.  I like seeing bold, conscious businesses like this do so well. ", pos 
Picnik Austin , 8/12/2016 Came to this spot for the fist time the other day. I was slightly confused on what to order but Gisel with the really cool hair was front and center to guide me. I am new to paleo so having a spot like this is amazing! , pos

Picnik Austin , 6/9/2016 Staff is very friendly at this paleo food truck.  The crowd is mainly from the neighborhood and feels very local.  My primary reason for visiting besides being right down the block is their awesome butter coffee. , pos 
Picnik Austin ," 7/20/2015 1 check-in This is an amazing concept - a Paleo coffee bar/restaurant doing business out of a converted trailer on a little hill in Austin. So quaint and perfect.  Everything they serve here is Paleo approved. They welcome any and all questions about ingredients and totally understand why you're asking unlike most conventional food or drink establishments. They are primarily a coffee bar with pre-made to-go meals out of the cooler. Their signature item is BUTTER COFFEE. Yes, butter. I had an iced version. It is amazingly delicious! Try it.  This whole place just SPEAKS to me on so many levels. If you're doing Whole30 or eat Paleo full-time, definitely give Picnik a try! ", pos 
Picnik Austin ," 2/17/2016 Finally got a chance to check this place out and I already can't wait to go back! I'm on day 46 of my Whole30 (...or Whole90) so I was so very happy to hear about this place.  I got the Carnitas Tacos and my friend got the Spaghetti Squash Lasagna.  Both were so delicious.  Yep, the prices are a little high - but for good quality food and great taste, I'd say it's worth it for a treat time to time.  I also tried the Butter Coffee and it was so smooth and delicious, and now I have all the energy!  The staff were also incredibly friendly and welcoming.  They asked if we had been there before and followed by telling us all about Picnik.  The sun was also shining and it was a beautiful day to sit outside which didn't hurt the experience either :) ", pos 
Picnik Austin , 2/14/2016 Finally came and tried this place out after driving by so many times. The staff is super friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. The butter coffee and dirty chai drinks are so good. I also had the pork carnitas tacos which were amazing! Bring a picnic blanket and enjoy some sun :) We'll definitely be coming back again... And again! Delicious chocolate cupcake for Valentine's Day , pos 
Picnik Austin ," 8/9/2014 36 check-ins Oh, hey, oh  Butter coffee, are you listening? Wondering where you've been all my life I just started living Oh, butter coffee, are you listening?  When you say you love me Know I love you more And when you say you need me Know I need you more Butter coffee, I adore you, I adore you  Miley Cyrus gets my love for butter coffee. Not only can you get it sweetened with maple syrup but they have a bajillion other sweetner options.  Be warned: the food is not hot and is in the refrigerator. That said, it's still absolutely delicious and guilt free.  The food is not expensive for the quality of the ingredients. For example. they use vital farms chicken. I purchase vital farm chicken and it is quite pricey BUT it's non-gmo feed and vital farm's has mobile hen houses. You can't expect that kind of quality without a price tag. IMO, all of their dishes are 100% worth the price.  Grass fed butter, raw cacao, amazing ingredients, and always super friendly people. Perfection! ", pos 
Picnik Austin ," 3/7/2016 Picnik: the trailer where your Paleo-cafe dreams come true :) I'm pretty certain that I've tried everything on the menu. My favorites include: Marshmallow Chai, any muffin, the Green Machine and the grilled chicken and green beans. Always great service, nutrient dense fare and happy people on a sunny little spot overlooking S Lamar. Bring your pup and sprawl out in the grass while sipping a butter coffee. I couldn't image living in a city without a Picnik. ", pos 
Picnik Austin ," 6/29/2016 Beautiful people and great idea. This little stop is like a food truck that lost its wheels but kept the vibe. Loved the little frittaata and my drink, but the frittaata lacked bold flavor while the drink came on too strong. ", pos 
Picnik Austin ," 5/6/2015 Picnik does paleo. You may be a reticent fan (like say, Beth D) or not, but there is certainly more and more evidence proving that most of us should eat a lot fewer carbs, and more healthy fats... which can happen a lot if you stick to a paleo-style diet. Whether cavemen ate this way is of course still up for debate.  I had their chicken salad (ok, but definitely slacking on mayo-ness), and soup of that day which was a lot better - some kind of beef with squash?    Anyhow, portions were definitely pricier than I'd like for what I got, and I'm not a big guy. I'm sure it's tough trying to do what Picnik is doing as a (as far as I know) single food trailer establishment, but even so.    I can't comment on their coffee beverages, as I can consume neither coffee nor butter (which together constitute a 'Bulletproof' coffee-type beverage - google for details on this), though they may be great.  If PIcnik could get their food prices down a notch, I'd bump 'em up to the 4 star. ", neutral

Picnik Austin ," 4/23/2015 10 check-ins Picnic AUSTIN has embraced the butter coffee movement and they have done so in favorable fashion.  The shear fact that I will drive out of my way to grab a coffee at Picnik should speak for itself.  I'm a big fan of making my morning coffee with MCT oil and butter, but something just tastes better when someone else makes it for you.  I am a fan of the Little Larry and on a sweet day the Pumpkin Spice Latte.    I've only eaten once and it was fine, but as you have seen in the other reviews that many of the items are from the fridge or not warm.  Picnic does have additional supplies from coffee to even some Bulletproof products which are usually only available online.    This is a trailer so you must be prepared to sit outside or take it to go. ", pos

Picnik Austin ," 11/10/2015 1 check-in So this was my first Butter Coffee experience. Not at all what I was thinking. It's not coffee with a pad of butter in it. They butter is more like the dairy and it's blended in. I was made aware of all the health benefits of the butter, which is certainly nice, but I was there for a beverage on a hot day. I must say, it did have a lovely flavor. Not all too buttery, not a coffee that was made with milk either. Really interesting and I would certainly have one again. ", pos 
Picnik Austin ," 6/8/2015 I have been going to eat to Picnik for over a year, my wife is the one who introduce me to the paleo stuffs. And I'm not ""super paleo guy"" guy at all. But I know how to recognize a healthy drink and food with a good flavor and an excellent customer service. It Isaac very relax atmosphere at Picnik, staff always friendly, patient and with knowledge of what do they sell. Yes everybody it is not cheap! But it is worth it for you and for your body. And you will enjoy it. Good job Picnik! In our past wedding anniversary we just stop by for a drink. ", pos 
Picnik Austin ," 5/20/2016 I'm not particularly interested in paleo diets but I stopped by here for a coffee due to the great Yelp reviews. I tried the hot butter coffee. It is very rich and creamy, I could see it keeping you full for quite a while. I don't usually add cream to my coffee but I was very happy with it :-) ", pos 
Picnik Austin ," 8/24/2015 2 check-ins Came here for lunch for the first time to try their pork tacos & Dirty Chai. The guy who took our order was very nice, but he failed to tell us that all food orders aren't actually made- you just take them from the fridge. We didn't know because 1, we've never been here before and 2, we've never eaten cold pork tacos so it never even crossed our minds. After waiting ~20 minutes we finally just asked about the tacos and he said to take them from the fridge. We were definitely standing around near the counter for a good while waiting, so I don't know why he didn't just tell us sooner. The tacos weren't bad, but it was weird eating them cold. The Dirty Chai was okay as well, but nothing special. :/ Dirty chai x 2 ", neutral 
Picnik Austin ," 9/6/2014 Love the butter coffee, but my recommendations would be... 1. Make a menu with larger font 2. Include nutritional value info on menu regarding butter coffee 3. While I appreciate whole foods etc. the food menu items are WAY overpriced Butter coffee ", neutral 
Picnik Austin ," 6/12/2016 This place is Awesome! It was worth the drive from Round Rock. Great people, place and the food was great!! I would highly recommend! ", pos 
Picnik Austin ," 10/13/2015 I enjoyed the gluten free options. The food is fresh, convenient and pretty tasty. However, portions are super small. Since we eat paleo we eat at least regular portions. These are better suited for kids. I ended up getting two orders of the tacos. They were fab but ended up being pretty pricey since I got two orders.  I would def recommend as a really good paleo option but prob for just a light lunch or snack. The outside lawn is the only seating option. We loved this but if the weather was hot or rainy its a no-go. Great for letting kiddos run around. ", pos 
Picnik Austin ," 2/4/2016 We are on day 18 of a Whole30, basically the point where cooking every single meal is starting to get super boring. But, we didn't want to give up so I started looking for places we could eat and Picnik came up. We made the trek from North Austin and it was well worth it. Jessica who helped me at the counter was amazing. Having just done a W30 herself, she was super knowledgable and friendly. No anxiety about trying to order with such a restrictive diet what so ever! If only it was this easier elsewhere... Missing a good latte, the iced butter coffee (sub ghee) really hit the spot and was way better than other butter coffee attempts I had previously. My fiancé and I shared the soup of the day which was a really flavorful steak fajita, the chicken Caesar wrap, and the chicken and green beans. Best $35 I could spend during this process! Everything was delicious and compliant which made us feel great. Excited about the north location, as we will definitely be back even after this 30 days is over. THANK YOU FOR EXISTING PICNIK!!!

Picnik Austin ," 6/10/2015 1 check-in Butter coffee (""bulletproof coffee"") was mind blowing.  I had the mocha something hipster-y.  I mean, leaps and bounds over Starbucks or even a good ole Cafe Su Da from a Vietnamese Pho place.  I will be back for more creamy dreamy goodness there!  (5* for the coffee, keep it coming!)  Now for the food.  I should have passed on the cold steak.  The wings were tasty but... As crisp as you'd expect from fridge temps.  The chicken salad-esque entree was also well liked by both of us as well.  But damn, I eat Paleo all the time and spending over $50 at a food truck for 2 people to each have a drink and 1.5 ""entrees""  a piece didn't leave me feeling excited over the decision to eat here.  (4* flavor)  However.  Food sold cold with no option to heat it on site?  Come on.  I'm buying grass fed extra expensive protein and organic veggies. They shouldn't all be served straight from your storage fridge.  That feels lazy.  (2*)  Ambience was nice, no trouble parking and there were a few on site seating options.  The workers were all plenty nice and service was prompt with lots of smiles, but I'll be limiting future visits to that creamy dreamy butter coffee!  Yum yum!  (4*) ", pos 
Picnik Austin , 4/30/2016 Loved their mocha - butter coffee was so-so. Only reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5 is that it was pricy at $6-8 per coffee. Love the vibe of the place and the staff was super helpful and nice! , pos

I'm getting all those good fats and oils along with the coffee I was going to drink anyways. The iced peppermint coffee is le shiz.

I'm pretty sure most of their food is pre-made in a different location. It's all ready to go and waiting in the refrigerator but they do have hot tacos and amazing coffee. There are only 2 places in south Austin that serve bullet proof coffee and picnick opens an hour before the other place so I can actually get some on my way to work. Love it.

I do LOVE their butter blondies (I've probably had about 10 up to this point haha). Picnik is a great place for coffee, lunch, and healthy desserts.

See, I have a forbidden love affair with butter, so this was buttery music to my ears.  I can now justifiably douse my (__enter any edible food item here_) in butter sans guilt.  Thank you oh cashier of Picnik Austin.  As a self proclaimed Chai tea connoisseur, I went for what I know best.  I decided to go wild and got the dirty chai. The butter added a rich and creamy flavor - yum.  I also grabbed a salad which was half off.   Half off any fresh foods can be off putting but I was starving and, as other yelpers mentioned, the full price of this little box of greens was just ridiculous.    Sitting on a charming little picnic table overlooking Lamar was oddly pleasant.  Next time I need some butter to balance out my blood sugar levels, I will pay Picnik Austin a little visit. ", pos

Picnik Austin ," 7/7/2014 1 check-in Listed in Gluten-Free in Chicago & Beyond One of my absolute favorite spots in Austin. Who would have thought so much goodness was packed into a small trailer!  We were super parched and hungry, but didn't want to get too full before dinner, and their coffee hit the spot as it contains grass-fed whey protein. I had the mocha chocolatte which was SO refreshing and filling on a super-hot day! I'm always so pleasantly surprised that you don't need sugar to make something taste so tasty (ingredients include cacao butter & powder, maple syrup and vanilla bean among others).  My husband had the Strawberry Banana Bliss with green coconut water, frozen strawberries and bananas and primal fuel. He loved it!  It was so nice to not have to worry about any gluten contamination either as they are a strictly paleo and was reassured no gluten products are ever used in the blender.  Not only was my drink amazing, but seriously some of the best and friendliest service we've ever gotten! The girls were so upbeat and friendly, it's contagious!  A few people were sprawled on some rugs in the grass and we snagged a great spot on one of their picnic tables; we didn't want to leave!

Back at home, in California, I do order all my meat from a sustainable, non-gmo  no corn-soy-or grain fed, grass-fed, local farm and let me tell you the price is right! Quality food is more expensive and worth it, you should be more concerned why your ""whataburgers""  out here are so cheap.

I watched as this little trailer arrived on site and through it's construction. Things looked promising. This location is hard to see in the parking lot due to a lot of landscaping equipment from another business, but it is attracting a following. The hours are still not set in stone as it is so new and they are trying to determine their customer flow. But friend, it is good.  This location is actually just down the road from another big time coffee chain, but it is not the same. You can stand and watch extreme precision in the preparation, somewhat like someone painting a portrait. My favorite is the ""All Nighter"" only in the morning. They have sweeter versions and a good alternative is the ""It's Complicated"". The cost is more than a cup of black coffee of course, but you get what you pay for.  As an added tidbit of information, it is next to a Tex-Mex taco trailer and the combination goes together ""like peas and carrots.""  Well done, and I will be back!

Kowabunga Coffee , 5/22/2016 A nice departure from Starbucks...it's nice having a local variety available. The coffee was delicious and strong. I had the Americano and my husband had the trophy wife. The trophy wife was a bit strong but I added some of my plain Americano to it to help balance it out. The service was fast and very friendly workers. It's also a pretty convenient location. Only problem is that is is kind of expensive. A small black coffee is $3.50. I'm okay with it though since you are supporting a local business. , pos

Kick Butt Coffee Music & Booze ," 9/7/2016 Updated review Much nicer & more spacious since my last visit some months ago. Plus a decent mix of contempo jams piped in for atmosphere. I get the impression that this joint probably rocks during the evening hours. The menu looks interesting but it was too early to order lunch. Was greeted by a friendly gentleman who took my order & payment for a 20 oz frappe. Asked for my name upon ordering but nobody called it when the drink was ready. When tilting the lidded cup towards me on my first sip I got a fat dribble of cold liquid down my front. Oh well. After a few minutes it occurred to me that the drink appeared small so I approached the counter with my cup to ask what size it was. The friendly fellow who overcharged me had been replaced by a young lady with a look on her face that seemed say ""dude why are you asking such a dumb question"" while her mouth flatly said ""16"" so I decided not to pursue the issue further. The drink was delicious but silly me for feeling intimidated. Came back a couple days later & it took a moment  to get any attention due the casual conversation ensuing behind the counter (different staff). Ordered another frappe with a breakfast taco which was tasty. But holy heck was that taco tiny for the price (see pic) and not even a ""thanks"" for the tip jar deposit. Classy. Based on my limited experience the service could use some improvement. But this seems true of many other places where the prices are not cheap & there's a jar at the counter prompting tips in advance for service yet to be provided. ", neutral

Internet works fast and coffee is great. Customer service is great also.  The Bad: I usually visit coffee shops to get out of the house and work elsewhere so I stay at the location for about 2ish hours. I'm not a fan of places who charge for refills, most don't but Kickbutt does charge .75 for a refill (hot coffee). Their coffee is already a little higher than nearby coffee shops and don't charge for refills so that will probably be the reason why I stick to my usual spot. Free refills will win me every time!

The heavy red and black does not feel like the usual urban hipster coffee house (concrete, brushed metal, natural wood, and some carefully chosen hip accent color--this look has become ubiquitous, kind of like a coffee mecca McDonald's).  They have a stage for music and open mic events, on one of my visits I heard young hipsters auditioning to be the Trivia Night emcee (my knowledge of old TV allowed me to crush one question only, but the rest of the time my huge gaping void of comic book and video game knowledge made me a loser).

I first came here during an open mic night and my friend who was told to come at a certain time to sign up was ignored over and over, despite being there early, and eventually told it was full. The open mic night was mediocre (like most open mics) and everyone was really close and if you were an outsider, it was really awkward. They have a lock on the bathroom door and you have to ask permission to get access in, because it is ""only for customers ""  They do serve liquor here and play movies in the back, which is cool and keeps kids entertained while mom is working or dads drumming in the band on stage.

Kick Butt Coffee Music & Booze ," 9/17/2015 1 check-in It's coffee, it's karate, and now it's music too. Seems like the success of Strange Brew with their music lounge has given other coffee shops a loftier goal to shoot for, and Kick Butt is going for it.  They've recently remodeled and doubled their space, moving the stage from a corner afterthought to a raised corner focal point, complete with pro sound and lighting. The tabled area is much larger, and they've added a full bar and kitchen for food, though they're not serving the full menu at night.  On the nights they have live music, they stay open later than their posted hours, so call to check before you head out. We saw a full rock band there recently and they started at 9PM. No wimpy music for a place called Kick Butt.  The coffee and sandwich vibe is still there during the day, so they're a good hangout and work/study  option if you're in the area. And if you're not into karate, don't worry, no pressure. Personally, I think Jackie Chan is kinda hot. Dave Ducharme-Jones Band on the new stage.

I would like to give more stars for those aspects, but Yelp doesnt have that option. Basically, the place is very cool; nice design, plenty of seating, and nice cushy seating at that.  But this review is strictly about the breakfast tacos. I had a lengthy review written, but even I didn't want to read it. So I am summarizing.  Fine Details: Tacos were $3 each and SMALL!!! Like, when I opened the baggy and pulled them out, I thought WTF!? Taste was good but nothing special considering Austin is a breakfast taco mecca. The corner Mexican taco trailer near my place at Cameron & Broadmoor serves tacos twice the size for a third less. And they are gooooooood!! I wish I had waited.

First off, I love how the owner is often hanging out here, drinking a coffee, interacting with customers and employees, just chillin.  There's something charming to me about a restaurant or bar where the owner can be found reading the paper or balancing their books.  Like they have have created the kind of place they would want to go to on the regular.    I love the food selection here.  Get here early enough and they have some tasty tacos.  TBH they're a little small for me but they are quite tasty.  They also carry greek parfait, bagels, pizza, sammiches, and other delicious treats.    The coffee is great as well.  Very flavorful.  It has a nice balance, doesn't taste like tea, or burnt. And of course it's great that they have alcohol.  I miss the Green Muse because I use to love working at a coffee shop all day and then come 6-7pm switch over from coffee to a good beer.  The atmosphere is warm and inviting.

I've since moved around and now reside in Cedar Park, so I come very infrequently now.  When I am in the area visiting family, I try to stop in, but haven't for awhile as my husband prefers Epoch.    I get emails regularly from Kick Butt so I feel like I know a lot about their history.  I appreciate the owner's passion for his place, and I remember the set backs and bumps along the way (like when the triangle location closed).  There are a lot of good coffee places in Austin, but I always rooted for Kick Butt, and often worried about it's future during that rough time.

Kick Butt Coffee Music & Booze ," 4/8/2015 Updated review 1 check-in Grabbed a latte at Kick Butt this morning. As I entered I was immediately and exuberantly greeted with what sounded to be my long lost friend, except that I had never met her. Perhaps they support sampling of their caffeinated beverages?  After looking over their lunch menu I decided against ordering anything. While they were eager to help accommodate my dietary requests in any way they could, their vegan options were very limited.  Ended up ordering a large (because it's that kind of day) English toffee latte with soy. One employee took my order and rung me up while the second FOH employee immediately began preparing my tasty beverage. Pricing was a bit steep (over $6) and I had to make sure I hadn't accidentally wandered into Starbucks, hence 4 stars rather than 5. I'd go with 4.5 stars if I could though (hint, hint yelp) because the service was outstanding.  The espresso beverage itself was also very good. Not quite the ""best I'd ever had"" as the barista assured me, but still quite nice. The froth was very creamy. I am a self-described ""foo foo"" coffee drinker, meaning that I take a little coffee in my cream and sugar, so the strong espresso presence in the drink was a tad much for me, however, I know it would have been perfect for the many coffee drinkers I know. Just something to keep in mind.  Overall the tasty caffeinated beverage, and especially the service, were pretty kick butt good. ", pos

This is the name for how many shots go into your coffee. 2, 3 or 4? GENIUS!  The treats are going to get me. I finally decided to cave and get one of their awesome cookies. If you have an affinity for some weird thing on a cookie, they have it. Cookie with fruit loops? Cookie with candy corn? Cookie with ruffles chips? And all with clever names, it's safe to say I'm going to have to get one of those cookies every time from now on. They've got breakfast tacos in the morning (pre-made, pre-wrapped for your convenience) and also serve lunch as well. In the evenings they have liquor and beer, and all sorts or quirky events. Someone else said it, and it's true, this is the least pretentious coffee shop in Austin. I've been to a lot of coffee shops. You want touristy, pretentious coffee? Drive south. You want coffee drank by the locals with a touch of weirdness? Here. ", pos 
Kick Butt Coffee Music & Booze ," 10/13/2014 2 check-ins A tad underwhelming considering the overall average rating on Yelp.    Went for coffee and the breakfast tacos.  The tacos were tiny, not made fresh to order yet wrapped in foil packages.    Lots of interesting stuff to read on the walls, friendly staff, and its Okay for sure.  Yet as the Taco Monster of the Brazos Valley I would seek breakfast tacos elsewhere where they are fresh made to order instead of tiny examples premade.

Not only do I like the venue and the coffee, the owner Thomas (shame on me for never really interacting to know if it's Tom or not) actually sends entertaining emails that I'm not upset that I signed up for.  That says something for his email marketing, since I do that kindof stuff for a living.  He's super entertaining and deserves great success with Kick Butt.    Thanks for having a great coffee shop!  I updated because there is a bit of a downside to the place... if you go in for coffee and there's a live show going on.. you have to walk in front of the performers... if it's comedy night... you might get called out... if it's poetry night... you might just kinda feel depressed... either way it's super awkward and it's taught me not to go at night if I'm not going to be entertained by whatever's going on on stage.  Bricking off that time that I can really just not go there for fear of awkwardness makes me lower my review. The glorious view from the tables in the front of the shop. Cookie town.

Less than 10 minutes from downtown and out of traffics reach it made me super pleased! Anyway, I walk in with my smeared makeup and probably giving off a weird odor.. They welcomed me nicely and the atmosphere was awesome! Really chill, and I can see myself going back and just spending hours there! By the way... Order a caramel cafe latte, it was the best latte I've had in awhile... I've been on a hunt for one that actually tastes good. And to all you white girls out there.. Totally beats Starbucks.

The garbage was filled to capacity, the cream and sugar area was sticky and gross. And honestly, the place smelled.  I was pretty put off. I didn't want to go back...but I did. I *must* have caught them right after a rush. While i'm not impressed with their coffee  their lattes are THE BEST I've had in Austin. Hands down. I've had the coffee twice now. I go by around 4pm and maybe that's a strange hour but one time my coffee was luke warm and the next time it tasted burnt. After a wicked crap day I stopped again and said it would be the last time, that's when I got the latte.  + That latte was ordered, paid for and in my hands in less than 2 minutes. Super barista! + That latte was goooooooood + the employees are very polite. + I didn't have to repeat my drink order + there were zero snarky comments when I asked where the 'sugar free' list was (you know who i'm talking about...mermaid logos, attitude problems, over priced everything?)  - not a big fan of the coffee. *might* try that one more time  I don't know if i'll swing by to try and ""adult bev"" any time soon after work but I will eventually and update from there.

This place is always clean, the baristas are not only easy on the eyes but they know what they are doing. Places like this make Austin what it is. It's a unique hybrid of martial arts studio and coffee house with live music occasionally. They even have a big screem tv that plays kung fu movies and they have booths instead of IKEA styled table and chairs like the national chain coffee shops have.

The cafe is kind of small but there is a lot of tables for students to study on and also a small corner with two futons for those that just want to relax.  I came here twice in the same week and both times ordered the Hazelnut Latte. Double Shot. Hot. They serve it to you in these really interesting long silver cups. The price of their drinks are a little on the expensive side in my opinion but they were very delicious!  There is always one person working but the workers were super nice. They are very patient with you and do their jobs very well. Its not a bad place to study. Everyone usually stays quiet and doesn't make it distracting for others. Around the midday on the weekend, it was pretty packed. So i'm not sure when they're big wave of customers come.  Their outdoor seating is super cute!

The barista is really nice and friendly, and she has some great drink recommendations. She plays really good music, which feeds the chill, calm, study-friendly vibes.  The decor is great, got that hipster vibe but they don't sacrifice table space for hipsterness, which lots of other places do. Lighting is a bit lacking, but it's not nearly as bad as places like Flightpath, etc.  Space is good--somehow, every single time I've come it's been maybe 75% full but with the perfect large table for me. Hm.  I'm not much of an outdoor-seating person bc I can't focus, but it looks good for meetings and such.  Now, I'm no coffee elitist, so I don't want to make crazy promises about the drinks, but I think they're solid. I've had the Cubano, Vietnamese Coffee, Irish Cream Latte, Iced Almond Milk Latte, and Chai Tea. All great, to me! And I've also had a ridiculous amount of their blueberry and Nutella cheesecake... 10/10 would recommend.  All in all, I'm looking for good, quiet, chill places to study with lots of room and not too expensive drinks, and this is it. ", pos

La Tazza Fresca ," 1/31/2016 2 check-ins Something that really sticks out to me about La Tazza Fresca is how friendly and approachable the staff are - they are always taking care of their customers and are generally very pleasant to interact with, which I really appreciate.  I love coming here to study late in the afternoon or in the evening, being that it is close to Hyde Park where I live. The atmosphere is a bit dark but comfortable for reading, listening to music or studying. I probably wouldn't come here to socialize but some people do.  The menu is quite large - I've heard their chai is some of the best in town but I have yet to try it. I love the metal cups that their hot tea drinks come in, and have not been disappointed by their coffee. I usually just order a hot latte wherever I go, and theirs is decent. Nothing special though - I like my lattes with a strong bitter coffee flavor, which I don't really get from theirs, but it's nonetheless good.  They also serve a variety of desserts / pastries, and I think a limited range of food options, as well as beers and other drinks, and there is outdoor seating if that's what you like.  Also, and this might just be me, but a nice bathroom is a huge plus at a coffee house, and though their bathroom is pretty rundown, there's a lot of interesting and unique graffiti, which keeps me entertained.

La Tazza Fresca ," 3/11/2016 1 check-in Cutest coffee shop I have ever been to! I'm visiting Austin right now and needed to find a spot to study during the day. And I stumbled upon this spot. It's near UT, so there were several other students studying, but there were also young professionals and people having coffee dates/hanging out.  Plenty of seating. It's pretty easy to find a seat during the morning and later at night. They did have a little study rush when I came in around 5pm...which makes sense since students were coming out of class.  I read so much about the dirty chai, so I tried both the iced and hot versions. It is DELICIOUS. I definitely recommend it. The flavor and espresso are consistent. The chai and espresso work perfectly together. I love how they have their chai powder mix for sale as well!  Service was great! Each encounter with the baristas behind the counter was pleasant - they're patient, kind, and helpful if you need any recommendation. Iced Dirty Chai + chicken salad sandwich with tomato basil soup = great study session ", pos 
La Tazza Fresca ," 7/20/2016 Best iced coffee in town, maybe anywhere. They lightly spice it, not enough to make it taste like dessert, but enough to make it distinctive and crazy delicious.

It took me awhile to figure out where the entrance was, but once I did, I was in heaven.  It's a nice relaxing coffee shop.  Every time I've gone, there's been a place to sit.  The music is also very mellow and doesn't distract you from what you're doing.  I would recommend that they get more baristas.  The lines can get pretty long and the wait gets a little crazy when there's only one barista available to fill everyone's orders.  I fully intend to go to this location again. ", pos 
La Tazza Fresca ," 2/4/2016 I was a bit dissapointed by this coffee-shop. It took me 30 minutes to get my coffee today, and when I did it was ridiculously sweet - in their defense, I chose something called the Chocolate-Vanilla coffee, and it was fairly large for a small.  The only pther drink I've had their was an expreso, and it was weak. Since most of their drinks are espresso based, I'm hesitant to try more.  The Pros: close to the 801 bus stop and campus, and cheaper than the Starbucks across the street. They had a lot of teas, so I might end up trying it again. ", neutral

They really just take a scoop of that, mix it in steamed milk, and add more milk until it fills the cup.    Apparently there's also a discount for UT students so WOOHOO!

Broken water dispenser, cracked couches, taped up menus, fading chalk boards where the drinks used to be posted-- just a bit run down.

La Tazza Fresca ," 2/22/2015 1 check-in La Tazza Fresca is not meant for coffee snobs. That being said, I'm not even that knowledgeable of coffee, and I base everything on taste--but LTF is not meant for someone who loves coffee.  Period.  LTF is a coffee shop way down Guadalupe, a perfect location for students although perfect is stretching it because the parking lot is small and crowded, the line waiting to get coffee is forever too long and never ending, and the amount of seats available is slim to none. On the bright side, many of the tables pull out, so that's a nice thing if you need the extra seat.  A double vanilla latte was poured into a tall stainless steel container, super creamy and sweet and hot. Let me rephrase that: Watery creamy, way too sweet, and a lot hotter than I would expect for espresso. It tasted like Epoch's vanilla latte. That's not a compliment.  LTF just completely missed what I expected a good cup of coffee to taste like. I probably should have expected it because they offer all these flavors from minty mocha to Black Forest to coconut vanilla. Too many flavors is usually a sign of poorly crafted coffee. I should have seen it coming.  If you enjoy a sugar high coffee that tastes more like sugared milk, this is probably the place for you. I prefer places where I can taste rich coffee.  La Tazza Fresca was just not for me. There are many places in Austin I would much rather go to.  On a high note, service was very sweet. ", neutral 
La Tazza Fresca ," 4/28/2016 This is a good place, but not great. The food portions are generous. The tuna sandwich was very good. The coffee was just fine too. The barista was as nice as can be. But the cafe isn't what I would consider a comfy place to sit and work. There are a two comfortable chairs, but most of the place is hard seating and tables. There isn't enough room to just relax and  get work done. Plus, it has a rather tense atmosphere exuded by the stressed out students who fill the place. The outside seating is very nice, but I couldn't get a strong enough wifi connection out there to work. I had to wait until someone left inside to get a spot. ", pos

La Tazza Fresca ," 1/10/2015 1 check-in I came back to La Tazza Fresca for the first time since college (wow, time flies!!) and I still found it to be as enjoyable as I remembered it. We were visiting for the holidays and I needed a nice, quiet space to relax and recharge before going back to the in-laws... I'm sure someone on yelp feels me on that one.  On an weekend afternoon, it was very mellow and felt as cozy as I remembered. There are tables of all sizes, some couches, and outside tables to choose from. There are a ton of power strips everywhere for people who want to study (why don't other coffee houses think of that). Since it's a little further north of campus, it draws a much quieter student crowd then that of, say, the starbucks in west campus. I think it usually  draws more of an older crowd too, which is nice now that I don't dig the college scene.  I really like the music they were playing: a little piano, a little jazz, a little of generic coffee house singer/songwriter stuff. Mellow and good for getting your mind right.  I think they have an excellent tea list. Peppermint and peach passion are my favorite at this joint. The man behind the counter was polite and helpful, and offered my husband suggestions when it came to the food and coffee. There isn't a big parking lot, but you can park in the neighborhood close by. Or take one of the many buses that pass by!  I sat and enjoyed a few hours of reading a book in peace with a nice cup of tea. If that's what you're into, then I think you'll like this place too! ", pos

La Tazza Fresca ," 12/17/2013 4 check-ins This coffee shop is a hidden gem on guad. I kind of want to keep it that way, but I shall share it's awesomeness with the Yelp world.  La Tazza Fresca is so cozy and cute! I came here with a girlfriend when we were looking for some late night coffee and dessert and it definitely hit the spot! I got their pumpkin spice latte with soy milk and less sugar (I'm a health freak, I know) and their cheesecake brownie. The latte was delicious! It made for the perfect autumn beverage on a cold rainy night. The brownie was a different story though. It was kind of hard and dry, tasted like it had been sitting out for a while. They were also out of a lot of stuff. I think I asked for 2 or 3 other flavors of latte and finally had to settle with pumpkin, but it all worked out!  Note: It's a pretty small coffee shop so you might not find a space during peak hours if you're looking for a place to study. But if you get lucky, you're lucky because this place is chill. I'll definitely come here to study next time. ", pos 
La Tazza Fresca ," 12/2/2014 This place has a great, cozy vibe during the day but the times I've walked by at night it looks way too crowded for my tastes.  The tea is pretty standard fare (stash teabags) and they didn't seem to have any fresh breakfast items.  Credit card minimum is $2.50 so come prepared to buy coffee for the person behind you or bring cash. ", neutral

La Tazza Fresca ," 2/2/2016 Without a doubt the best cup of plain coffee I have ever experienced.  It has a subtle hint of sweet to it, almost like it was roasted with cinnamon, and is perfect just the way it is.  WARNING: if you are someone who truly likes a strong, slap your grandma cup of coffee flavor, this isn't it.  For the longest time I couldn't drink coffee unless it was loaded with cream and sugar, and gradually I've trained myself to either drink it black or with just a bit of almond milk.  That being said, I find some coffee undrinkable without cream and sugar, but thankfully the coffee at La Tazza Fresca is not one of them.  Literally after my first sip I was hooked, and texted my friends to tell them about the life-changing cup of coffee I've just had.  Does anyone know where they get their coffee from??  Heard they had the best chai latte in all of Austin.  I just moved here a few weeks ago so will have to update my review on this later after I've had more to compare to, but I will say I wasn't overly impressed.  But, as I said, their coffee is wonderful and I'd like to start a fan club page for just the coffee. ", pos 
La Tazza Fresca ," 12/13/2015 A nice little coffee shop with lots of space (especially when its nice enough to sit outdoors). Reasonable prices and adequate space to get some work done. I got the Turkish Coffee and the girl I was with got a Coconut Vanilla Latte... both were excellent. Wouldn't go significantly out of the way for it, but if you're in the neighborhood and looking for a spot to get some work done or talk over coffee its an excellent spot. ", pos

La Tazza Fresca ," 5/11/2015 La Tazza has a special place in my heart. It's definitely my favorite study sanctuary in this part of town. The Chai smoothie is heavenly (hang over cure)! And I also love their creamy tomato soup; it's awesome that a cup is included with a sandwich, but I also order a bowl a la carte sometimes. I've had the veggie sandwich a million times and I've never gotten sick of it. I think management does an awesome job hiring their staff because everyone I've ordered from is kind and speedy! This place is an Austin gem. Cucumber avocado sandwich, the best soup ever and a Chai smoothie! :) ", pos 
La Tazza Fresca ," 3/26/2015 Very old building with its own atmosphere. Think of a rainy day at home, that's what this place feels like. Pastries, limited but still very good. They have a lot of different coffee flavored, smoothies, teas, etc. I got an English toffee latte. One word. Foamy :) oh, and they have a lot of food options.  It's a pretty large cafe with a lot of space, inside and out, but since it's near UT it can get crowded. Choose your time wisely.  I'm coming back to this hidden gem. ", pos 
La Tazza Fresca ," 5/9/2016 Generally crowded inside so if the weather isn't great, good luck finding a place to sit. However, outside has a lot of room so I would recommend sitting outside. Overall, solid coffee and there is a bar! ", pos 
La Tazza Fresca ," 11/12/2013 1 check-in This cafe is a regular spot for the Austin Argentine Tango scene on certain Fridays.  As soon as you walk in, you can smell the coffee that is engrained on every surface of this place.  Cute decor and a neat menu with pastries and snacks that you can munch on.  The young man behind the counter was polite and nice - happily providing recommendations when I asked him his opinion on their Italian sodas.  I had the Peach Cream Italian Soda, and I absolutely loved loved loved it.  Their chai was also yummy.  The apple pie a tad too sweet, but that's just me.    Great ambience and the prices are not extravagant either! ", pos 
La Tazza Fresca ," 7/29/2014 1 check-in Vibe: Cozy and mellow. High ceilings and options for couch sitting, seating at the bar, smaller tables for one or two, or larger tables for 4, 5 if you're just sitting and talking vs. trying to work on laptops. Plenty of outlets. There are even a few outlets outside (though they've never worked for me).  Wi-fi: The have over 6 wi-fi networks to choose from, with options for 5G. Quick connection, but I'm pretty sure my debit card info got stolen when I ordered something online here, so I'd advise doing your online shopping elsewhere if ya wanna avoid the headaches, calls to the bank, paperwork...  Coffee and food: I love their iced chai tea lattes! Very good, especially in comparison to the iced chais at other coffee shops in the area (cough cough Bennu cough). The pie is good when it's fresh! Their smoothies are pretty good too.  Parking: Pretttty limited, but there is street parking in the neighborhood. Not a far walk.  Crowd: if you're going after 5pm during the school year, call ahead to check if there are open tables. Nothing is less motivating then walking in and having to immediately walk out. Mixed crowd, lots of older folks. There's a good number of students here during the fall and spring semesters. Cozy, not cramped! ", pos

La Tazza Fresca ," 9/13/2015 I'm going to give it 3 stars because I've been coming here for 3 years now since college. I love the classical, French sort of music they are playing. I also love the cozy ambience of this coffee shop, which makes me go there to relax on a cold winter day. I had a bad experience when I went a few days ago on a Friday night. They close at midnight, and it was 11:52, and the barista would not make me an espresso shake, which is what I was craving. It was a huge let down for me, as it only takes a few minutes more to make the shake and clean up afterwards. I understand it's pity to complain about not getting an espresso shake, but I drove all the way from up north to come here. It's about providing a world class customer service experience and that means getting the customer what they want, while the coffee shop is open. ", neutral 
La Tazza Fresca ," 12/15/2013 1 check-in Great place to study with plenty of plugs, but limited space. I got the passion peach tea and it was good. I do need to come back for their coffee since apparently after reading a lot of these reviews, they do a little something different with a hint of cinnamon/nutmeg? Well, I'll have to just come see for myself.  Parking was a disaster, but there's neighborhood parking around the area. ", pos 
La Tazza Fresca ," 2/17/2015 I was a regular here while at UT. Oh man, it was sort of embarrassing how often I would be at La Tazza. I'm pretty sure I knew all the baristas. Anyway, the Nutella ganache cheesecake is A+ and I know my cheesecake.  For a coffee-related treat, you can order any of the espresso milkshakes. THEY ARE HUGE and definitely meant to share, but they're just so good. Better than the espresso milkshake at Alamo Drafthouse. Yes. Also the dirty chai latte is pretty much one of the best I've ever had. And I know my chai.  But the reason I keep coming back is because that bottomless coffee is a GOOD DEAL if you need to stay up. They usually play soft jazz or crooners from the 20's--so it's a nice, relaxed vibe. Perfect for studying (most people study there). I feel like you could have a date here, but probably during the summer when there are fewer students. You don't exactly want to be surrounded by college students. Perfect for meetings & tutors & just regulars. The baristas are nice and non-invasive (most of the time) and good at what they do.  Right, so I've gushed enough. I love it for what I needed it for--studying during college. Parking is available in the lot if you go between 6pm and 8pm probably. Otherwise, you can just park on the residential street. It's not bad at all. ", pos 
La Tazza Fresca ," 2/16/2015 La Tazza Fresca serves DELICIOUS Coffee drinks, non-coffee drinks (teas & italian cream sodas), and food.  Whatever I order here is never less than SCRUMPTIOUS, and the environment is cozy. Ample seating is available: seats at the bar, round tables, square tables, tables for two, couches.  It's a very nice set-up. It's really cozy and inviting and relaxing.  If I had to rate just the food and drinks, I would give it five stars based on trying the following: Tiramisu Latte, Plain Coffee, Herbal teas, Chai Latte, Pesto-Hummus Bagel sandwich, Avocado Sandwich & Tomato Soup, cheesecake  PROS: WI-FI, great food, very friendly service, board games, comfortable seating, background music is lovely and not at all disruptive, patio seating available. Can spend hours working here and manage to be productive, which is often difficult at coffee shops.  CONS: car parking can be difficult, can get crowded inside & can be difficult to find enough seating if you aren't alone, dim lighting, cozy but tiny environment. Temperature inside can be a bit on the colder side when it's cold outside.  BOTTOM LINE: Great service, Great Drinks, Great Environment for working / meeting (in my opinion, La azza Fresca offers the best environment (for working, studying, and/or meeting) of all the coffee shops I've visited in Austin).

Convenient, right? I decided to drink 3 of them between 9pm-12am (when they close). I made a huge mistake. I went to bed at 3am, and now I'm writing this review...at 7am. At least from this one experience, I'm going to say that their coffee is really strong, and that's a good thing.  Pros: LOTS of outlets, can find parking (especially on 37th), free wi-fi, good environment for studying or meeting with friends, friendly staff  Cons: Music was a little loud (and weird selection, IMO), not 24 hours, a little cramped  Tip: You're going to wanna be sure that you have your headphones if you intend on focusing. Since the place is a little cramped, it's easier to hear others' conversations. Snapshot of the counter and a feel of the place ", pos

I am a fan of the atmosphere and numerous table options to accommodate various sized groups, but if it's a late weeknight don't expect to find a seat. Everyone is studying around these times and it's very quiet, which I can appreciate. The individual behind the counter was very inviting unlike other establishments I been to.

La Tazza Fresca ," 5/6/2014 Cool little coffee place next to Groovy Lube. I stopped there when searching fruitlessly for the Beware Coffee trailer, which was nowhere to be found. Still, La Tazza was good--a great iced mocha, and a good but not too giant breakfast burrito.  My only complaint was that it was freezing inside, so much so that I left before I really wanted to, and didn't get the second cup I was considering.  The guy working there was nice, and the few folks there were subdued. You can tell that in the evenings it's probably wall-to-wall with students surgically attached to laptops (there were three Mac users among the four other peple there) so I wouldn't expect a seat during prime study times, if that's what you are thinking about.  Still, a cool little place--not up to the awesomeness of the original Halcyon downtown, but enough like it to make you mourn over what's happened to that place.  Lots of outdoor seating, parking is no doubt a nightmare in the evenings also, but was fine at 9ish on a weekday. ", pos

La Tazza Fresca ," 5/1/2012 1 check-in Came here for a meet-up after always passing it on Guadalupe, and before I've always been reluctant to go because it never seemed like there was sufficient parking.. but even during my visit I ended up parking in the residentials.  The outdoor patio, despite the one awkward table situated in the loose rocks, is pretty homey with garden chairs and plentiful outlets (!) and reminds me of your family's backyard where all the lawn chairs are dirty from leaves. The inside is pretty cozy with a mini-stage and some comfortable-looking chairs and lots of window lighting.  As for the food, it was pretty good. I got a warm sandwich with tomato basil soup, and it was fillingly delicious although it took practically forever to come out in comparision to my friends' avocado smoothies and warm teas. My friend warned me about the wait time, so I guess it was ok since it's homemade and warm as well. I did also remember it being a bit more than I'd like to pay, but I was hungry at the time.    I'd give them ideally 3.5 stars because I enjoyed my experience, but haven't had an urge to go back, since there's a lot of good coffeeshops closer to where I live in Hyde Park. Great spot for a UT student though. ", neutral 
La Tazza Fresca ," 12/18/2014 This is my favorite study spot near my apartment. Everyone is happy here and the music is great for studying. They have a variety of tables depending on what you need but there can be limited seating due to popularity. My favorite drink is for sure their dirty chai. It has a lot of zip to it. I would also suggest their mochas, which taste great with raspberry syrup. My only suggestion is to charge your computer before you go, there's lot of outlets but some tables are in the middle of the place. ", pos 
La Tazza Fresca ," 5/1/2013 5 check-ins Listed in The Yelp 100 Challenge - 2013 As weird as this may sound, I like studying here because I don't leave with a strange smell on my clothes. Even though La Tazza serves food, you don't smell like grease afterwards. Definitely a plus if you're going somewhere after!  This is a great study spot. The location is good since it's not too far from the UT campus and quite close to Amy's and Sno Beach. The tables are big so you can spread your stuff out instead of trying to cram a laptop, books, and a drink on a typical tiny round coffeeshop table. The drinks and food are decent. I've had a lot of their teas and the garlic / feta flatbread. The baristas are always friendly, so that's a plus!  My only complaint is their Wifi. It's great when the coffeeshop is near empty (maybe 3-4 tables) but once it hits noon, GAME OVER. My browser takes FOR-EVER to load and it's really frustrating and unproductive. They have six different Wifis you can connect to and usually ALL OF THEM ARE SLOW. It's seriously mind boggling.  Okay I lied, I have another complaint - PARKING. Their little driveway next to Groovy Lube only fits 4, maybe 5, compact cars. You have to double / triple park in the driveway. There is street parking but you'd have to come early to find a decent spot.  I would definitely recommend coming early (10AM) so you can find a parking spot, table, and Wifi that doesn't take 2 minutes to load a webpage. ", pos

I honestly don't know how much longer I'll be able to resist the beaconing of the chocolate cake with oreos... I do appreciate their wide variety of sandwiches, cookies, muffins, cakes, and other pastries though!  The one con to this place is they tend to keep the temperature on the warmer side.

La Tazza Fresca ," 7/1/2011 I was able to finish writing my thesis because of La Tazza's existence.      Bottomless coffee and a great atmosphere.  If you're a student looking to get away from campus, seeking a non-silent but non-loud place to study/read, this is a good option.  If you're wanting a chill place to chat with a friend, this is still a good option.  (They also serve wine and hookah, though I never came for those).  A few times, my roommate and I would play a game of chess while waiting for our laundry next door.    I must say the ambiance is better than the coffee, but I still put this place at the top of my list.  As far as food goes, the Tomato Basil Soup (which comes with a piece of toast) was tasty on multiple occasions. I've tried both their hummus sandwich and egg salad sandwich -- both good, but I prefer the egg salad.    As a loyal patron, I was going to give 5 stars, but on more than one occasion, I had a difficult time finding parking, only to later find that the search wasn't worth it because it was too crowded to find a good seat.  Afternoons/early evenings are better.    But to end on a positive note, free wifi! ", pos

La Tazza Fresca ," 2/2/2014 Awesome coffee shop! Reasons why include: kind baristas, jazz music usually playing, strong drinks, a million flavor options for flavored drinks (even though I always get the same one, I check out the list every time just in case I decide to get wild and go with the smores flavor or etc), cozy, and the prices are fair. The food looks tasty although I've never eaten there. Oh, and I love that the house coffee has a hint of cinnamon flavor! The main reason I'm writing this review is to say how awesome Colin is!! One night around closing time I was a little nervous about walking home (which is almost the closest apt to tazza, but there was a homeless man and a probably-not-weird-incident that I turned into I'm-gonna-get-mugged and I know this homeless man is probably actually very nice but I was carrying expensive electronics), and he offered and walked me home!! Very kind of him! ", pos

La Tazza Fresca ," 10/14/2012 1 check-in La Tazza Fresca is one of my favorite places to study in Austin. Granted, it is only a block away from my house, yet I still prefer it over most other coffee shops.  It is pretty small, eclectic, and they have a nice outdoor seating area as well.  They have a huge menu, and everything I've had has been delicious.  Pros: - Best latte I have ever had, EVER. They have an absurd amount of flavors, and all of them are amazing. My favorite is the white chocolate raspberry latte. - Plenty of outlets, you'll never have to compete for one - Relatively quiet, but not silent. Usually soft, unintrusive music playing. - Soft lighting, comfy couches, and regular tables - Bottomless coffee/ice coffee for $2.95  Cons: - Service is iffy. Some cashiers are really friendly and fast, others are somewhat rude. - Only open until midnight - Drinks are expensive, especially tea (over $3 for hot water and a tea bag? Really?) - Parking lot is tiny. There is free neighborhood parking but only at night and on the weekends.  General comments: - I haven't had any of their lunch food, so I can't speak to that.  Their pastries are always amazing. - Their regular coffee has a definite spice component to it.  It tastes especially cinnamon-y, so if you don't like cinnamon you probably won't like their coffee.  Warning: La Tazza offers hookah as well, although I rarely see people actually smoking it and I think they make you sit outside if you do want to smoke.  If you're bothered by hookah, I wouldn't recommend studying here.  La Tazza is a great place to study, or just grab a coffee and catch up with your friends.  It is much quieter and calm during the day, while at night it gets packed with college students studying right up until midnight.  I wish it wasn't quite as pricey as it is.  However, I will be back.  Update: I had their bagel with hummus today and it was AMAZING!!! I can't even express the joy I experienced eating it. It was made with pesto hummus, olives,  onions and a side of tomato soup for dipping.  Jaw drop. ", pos 
La Tazza Fresca ," 12/3/2012 Updated review 4 check-ins Have to downgrade La Tazza Fresca a bit, though I still like it.  In probably my first 5 visits, I was twice hassled by a sketchy homeless man for money, though in one instance the man running the coffee bar was on him in a flash and escorted him out. In the other instance, another worker just stood behind the bar while the guy went to every table, never doing a thing.  A woman I talked to while there one day told me that she had been threatened by a very aggressive homeless woman there, and that a worker got into an altercation with the same woman.  In those same 5 visits, the shop was not open twice when it was supposed to be... once it opened about a half hour late, the other time it was closed for painting (though it hadn't been posted ahead of time, as I'd been there).

La Tazza Fresca ," 12/5/2013 17 check-ins This is my favorite cafe in town!  I'm a hot-fruity-herbal-tea kinda' girl, and Tazza has an excellent selection with the Wild Berry as well as the Raspberry flavors.  And years ago, a friend talked me into trying a Soy Chai Latte here claiming it tasted like ""the nectar of the heavens"" or some such thing, and I've been getting one every visit since.  So good.  I get it hot since I like the foam, and soy since I'm now non-dairy, but it's good hot or cold, and with any milk.  I've preached its wonder to many a friend who are all now true believers.  Just tastes like magical happiness. They also have a hummus plate, which doesn't come with just hummus and pita, but an array of goodies like cheesy pizza crust, a spanakopita, a samosa, some olives and feta and other stuff, and it's only $7. They also have sandwiches and pizzas a soup; I've never had any of these items, but I think it's lovely that they're all offered. Always a nice ambiance, and great eclectic and quirky music selection, plus a nice and laid back staff.  And the dessert display is always filled with amazing goodies.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Always.

La Tazza Fresca ," 5/4/2012 2 check-ins Listed in Hidden Gems, Caffeine High, Texas Hold Em' I figured out during my brief visit to Austin that the best time to visit LTF is early in the morning on a weekday.  Since it's near the north UT campus, NO ONE is around.  I remember those days of sleeping until 12pm on a Friday...I can't say I miss them.  Now that I have become an early riser in my early 30s, I enjoy a place that is empty.  Such a delight.  The coffee here is truly great.  I ordered a simple iced coffee with cream and sugar, but the coffee had this amazing flavor that I couldn't quite pin down.  Then I realized it was nutmeg!  They put nutmeg in all their coffee and it is delicious.  I am now all about putting it in my morning coffee thanks to LTF.  And the atmosphere is so darling.  Very indie-coffee-shop-with-art-for-sale-everywhere kind of vibe.  And they have an adorable side patio for sitting and sipping.  Ironically (and unfortunately) there is a Starbucks directly across the street from LTF, but avoid it and support the mom and pop.  Your tastebuds will thank you. ", pos 
La Tazza Fresca ," 8/20/2012 3 check-ins Quite a few more people have discovered this place since I first started coming here during undergrad, and now it's a lot harder to find a table during peak studying time, but it's still a great place to go, either to get some work done or just to chill with friends.  There's a lot of plugs for laptops available.  They've added more/different tables and chairs since the old days, too, which make things a tiny bit more crowded, but not unmanageable.  Sometimes the music is a bit loud, but I think it depends on the crowd.  When a bunch of people are studying it's a bit more mellow.  The patio is a good escape if you want a quieter place to converse, but those tables and chairs do amass a good amount of dirt from Lamar traffic.  They do a pretty good soy chai latte, and though I'm not usually a coffee-drinker these days, their coffee is good as well.  If you're looking for something cold, they have a nice selection of  teas as well as Italian sodas (with or without cream).    I've never had good luck with the food, though.  As other reviewers noted, the pastries in the case tend to be stale, and taste like everything else in the case because they sit so close to each other.  The pizza tastes like frozen pizza bites, and the breakfast bagel was kind of on McDonald's level in terms of taste.  People have told me their sandwiches are good, so maybe give those a try if you're hungry. ", neutral 
La Tazza Fresca ," 6/24/2013 LTF is one of my favorite cafes in Austin.  Pros:  Location - Centrally located with a decent amount of parking. The parking lot fills up sometime, but usually you can find a spot on a side street within walking distance.  Coffee -The coffee is some of the best I've had in Austin. I can drink the drip coffee black (it's flavored, but strong and good), and the cappuccinos and lattes are outstanding.  Food - I've never been disappointed with their sandwiches or smoothies. The pizza is pretty good too. The pastries and baked goods can be really tasty depending on what day it is.  Service - The baristas are usually very polite and quick to serve. Most of them are friendly and have inviting personalities.  Environment - The music they play is unique, eclectic, and entertaining. It's never too loud or obnoxious and gives the place a good atmosphere.  The furnishings are also eclectic and mismatched, giving the place warm and home-like feel. Plenty of outlets for your laptop. The multiple patios are great for hanging out or studying on cool days.  Cons -  Food - The pastries and baked goods are inconsistent. Sometimes you get something really good and fresh, sometimes you get something really dry and stale that should have been thrown out and replaced a few days ago.  Environment - LTF is really popular during school sessions int he evening and midday on weekends. This isn't really a con in itself, but it's often hard to find a seat indoors and can get obnoxiously loud during peak hours. Honestly, this usually doesn't bother me, but it can be annoying if you're just looking for  a place to chill. Also, the outdoor patio furniture is pretty cheap and often dirty. Not awful cheap/dirty, but enough to lower the quality of the outdoor environment.  Summary: Overall, this is my favorite coffee shop in Austin. The coffee is amazing and the environment is great for talking with friends are studying. There's room for improvement, but most of its faults are minor and worth overlooking. ", pos 
La Tazza Fresca ," 6/5/2010 Another cafe, pretty close to campus.  Pros: Drinks are pretty good here, especially the smoothies.  I tried my friend's banana chai smoothie (sounds weird) that was shockingly good.  I got an italian soda, and was pleasantly surprised by the perfect amount of sweetness.  Cons: Trying to get to the bathroom was like a horror scene where you get jumped in the middle of a dark alley.  The lights in the hallway were off for some reason, so it looked super sketchy and spent time groping in the dark just to find the restroom. Which leads us to the cafe lighting.  IT IS DARK.  REALLY REALLY DARK.  bring your own mini lamp.  I'd come back for the drinks, but really think I need somewhere brighter to study.  Its not too loud either which makes it a consideration.

La Tazza Fresca ," 12/17/2012 2 check-ins Great study spot.  I ordered an iced Cafe Zino, which I had never seen before (espresso pulled through brown sugar) and it was great. Lovely bold flavor with just enough sweet, and I usually take my coffee black. Cozy decor makes for a nice atmosphere with comfy couches and sweet art along the walls. 5/5 for service alone! The barista was sweet and friendly, and brought drinks to the table which was really nice.  Only complaint is that it's hard to find. There isn't a visible sign (I hear it's blocked by trees) so know that it's adjacent to Groovy Lube, this could have saved me a little confusion.  Overall I had a positive experience and would recommend!  Edit: Several (5?) hours later and I am still here. Would like to add that the mix of jazz and swing playing over the loudspeakers is a welcome change from the distracting garage punk/indie goop that is so often heard at other popular study spots (not dropping any names but *cough cough* rhymes with Renooh).  Also, the hummus sandwich is yummy. The soup that comes with it was decent.  Editing again: Hookah too! Wow, this place just gets better. I'm totally giving that a try next time. ", pos

Epoch Coffee ," 10/25/2016 1 check-in I'd be wanting to try this spot for a long time and when the opportunity finally presented itself, I eagerly jumped!  After circling the lot a few times for a parking spot, I contemplated if this was worth a to-go latte, but I was determined. The coffee shop is tucked away in The Village shopping center with the hellish aforementioned parking lot of customers of all the various business competing for a spot.  Already a little defeated by the time I entered Epoch, I was welcomed by a relaxing atmosphere with a ton of seating options. I immediately realized it was a coffee shop really designed for people looking to plug-in and get some serious work done. They even have a nice patio in the back to take your work outside. If I have a long work day in the future, I'll know to go here to get in the zone, however for a casual meet-up, this might not be your place.  While there's definitely not a sense of urgency with the wait staff, it was more the lack of customer service that left a little more to be desired for me. In addition, compared to the standard sizes seen elsewhere in coffee shops, the large was more like a small. ", neutral 
Epoch Coffee ," 11/20/2016 1 check-in Cute place. Try the Mojo iced coffee... bomb.com. Plenty of indoor space: tables, bar seating and sofas. There's a quaint little outdoor seating area out back-- a portion of the outdoor space is covered. As far as the service, eh... it's not the best; friendly, but a bit slow to acknowledge their customers, which was a bit awkward to experience and to watch. All in all, Epoch is a pretty good coffee spot. I'd return for the Mojo. Chai Chai and mojo ", pos 
Epoch Coffee ," 8/3/2016 I'm not sure what it is about this place, but I feel like every time I step foot in it I am being silently judged by the baristas, like they don't think I'm jiggy-enough-with-it to be in their presence. I also think it's strange they only have 2 or so latte flavors... the first time I visited I desperately scanned their tiny menu for even a hint of options, but alas, vanilla it was.

They also have a wide menu - pour over, drip, cold brew, and espresso coffee drinks as well as a number of teas. The staff is also very helpful, answering questions any customers may have, and are easy to converse with.  I ordered a simple latte, and sat at the bar, but there is a wide range of seating from couches to small tables. Their espresso has a wonderful bitter coffee taste - super satisfying. I will warn that if you prefer sweeter drinks, you may want to order something with an added flavor of some kind. I've also heard their french press is great, but haven't tried it yet.  It's the perfect spot to catch up with friends or work. I'll come here again if I'm ever in North Austin! Latte + Vanilla Latte ", pos 
Epoch Coffee ," 7/29/2016 3 check-ins This location is on par with it's OG location (North Loop) it terms of drinks and the atmosphere is pretty good. I really love that they serve hot tea pots here. But I have a few issues:  1. The food. They have a decent kitchen just sitting there. When they first opened they used to make snacks and this was awesome! Now, the food and selection is sub par and unappetizing -- everything is prepackaged and brought in. The OG location does this too but they have way better vendors.  2. The hours. They used to be open until midnight but now close at 10pm. I hate this especially since the other location is 24 hours. While I don't think this location should be open 24 hours, I'm not sure why they're closing so early when the place is still really busy at 10pm. Bring back later hours... 12pm Thursday, Friday, Sat? Makes sense being next to Alamo Draft House.  3. The music. It's way too loud most of the time. I just heard a lady say ""it's too loud in here I can't hear you let's go outside"". The baristas often have the music BLASTING to where you will have a hard time hearing the person in front of you. I can't think. Don't even try talking a call inside... They also play weird shit. Play something your general customer population will enjoy, I'm not into your 80s metal. *** As I am writing this! A second group of moved out side ""is it quite out there?"" *** ", neutral

Epoch Coffee ," 7/31/2016 The coffee at this place is tricky, because once you come here, you might compare the taste of coffee at other shops and it wont do it for you.  The first time you try their iced latte with a shot of vanilla and sweetened to perfection, you will never feel the same euphoric feeling again, and its kind of a bummer.    But its better to have had this just once in your life then never again.  Oh and every time I go there, the baristas are very nice.  You never get the coffee snob vibe, which personally turns me off to some coffee shops. ", pos

I saw this new location when I was going to Madam mam's for lunch and instrantly I kenw that that is the place that I would like to go for a cup of coffee after the lunch.  I like this place, the atmosphere, and nice people working there. Everyhing should be above four strats. Except, the taste of coffee. I am not a coffee expert so my taste toward coffee may be very particular. I like dark french roast but when I tried the ""regular"" drip coffee. It was very sour. I know some coffee beans (or the type of roasting) have sour flavor but that's not the style of coffee that I prefer. So this review may be very skewed.

Epoch Coffee ," 3/21/2016 Another good coffee shop in Austin... I'm really amazed at how many places in this city are on point with their espresso. This location is tidy and comfortable. A good balance between shops that are so minimalistic you feel like you are in a museum art piece, and the places that feel like they haven't been cleaned in a dozen years. Like most places, I try an Americano the first time I stop in and unlike many places the Americano was perfect.

Also I expect that hip vibe from the place, stylish cups and warm welcome environment. Epoch disappointed on a few of those parameters... The space is large, but lacks style and atmosphere, feels like an old sandwich shop that was rented for, what I expected to be, a great coffee shop.  Now, my cappuccino... It's espresso and foam, people! A lot of foam (not macchiato) and not much milk (not a latte). It looked pretty, but was all milk inside... Sight... May be their sandwiches are great...

I have landed on three as I have come here several times, and have always taken my coffee away, as I am never compelled to stay here.  The coffee and staff are great, but cleanliness and ambiance are lacking.  My favorite is the cold brew coffee (sourced from Texas coffee roasters).  Their espresso is also tasty (sourced by Cuvee).  By the afternoon the pastries are limited and look stale, there is a small kitchen that serves up East End pies, and some interesting sounding food bowls and sandwiches.  Not really any fast take away gluten free options. The comfortable couch section off to the side looks dank and dirty sometimes, and just a hint too dark.  The rest of the seating area is cleaner, and they do have a nice small outside patio when the weather is right.  What is up with the ladies bathroom?  The door is still missing, and the useable stall looks like it was cleaned several weeks ago.    I also like that this place is open till 12 am, which makes a quick take away coffee before heading to a late night Alamo movie convenient See all photos from Mindy H. for Epoch Coffee ", neutral

But then not everyone is obsessed about that kind of stuff like me.  And when I say coffee ...I don't mean a latte, but a pour over or do a espresso. They guys have a pretty expensive machine to pull espressos, let they are always a let down with a very thin watery to non-existent crema, pour overs are done so hurriedly that once does not really get the full extraction of flavor for what otherwise should be a great cup of coffee coming from Cuvee.

Epoch Coffee ," 5/7/2016 Since all of my other reviews on Yelp tend to be complaints (sorrynotsorry) I thought I'd give a shout out to one of my favorite spots to quaff caffeine and work. The staff is friendly, kind, and  quick, the atmosphere is chill and has the paradoxical feel of an industrial space that is also and inviting. The coffee is strong and ethically sound, they have a small but decent selection of GF snacks, and even though sometimes it gets so crowded I've walked in and turned right back around to leave, mostly there is room at the inn. Their pretty authentic, homemade chai is the perfect combination of flavorful and potent but not too sweet. If you're used to a super sugary chai you might look elsewhere. I only wish they stayed open later here, like their rougher-around-the-edges sibling on North Loop. ", pos 
Epoch Coffee ," 10/27/2015 I love this place. I've been going for around a year and a half now and it is my go-to spot. The atmosphere is awesome and great for getting work done. It's also very chill, so showing up in the evening to chat with friends or work on group projects is fun, but the best part about Epoch is the baristas. They make an effort to know your name and have conversations with you and all are very friendly and offer suggestions if you're looking for something new to drink. The music selection kind of goes everywhere, but I kind of like it. It's never the same thing. They even offer a place to display art and don't take a cut if you sell anything. The coffee is also very good after they changed to a new brand a few months ago.  I think the only reason I have to not give 5 stars is that the internet is finicky at best and doesn't work at all at worst. It seems to work best in the mornings when very few people are in, but you start jumping between their two routers around noon and into the evening. I wouldn't say much about it except it is kinda of a 'working' coffee-shop, and if I KNOW I need internet that day for a client, I have to pass and go somewhere I know I won't get dropped or work from home.  All that being said, this is still my #1 place to go in Austin.

Yes, the music selection is quirky-sometimes they play a little too much Kate Bush or have an odd mix going on in the background-but it's rarely too distracting for getting work done.  They're working on being more personable by asking names and having more conversations with customers, and most of their baristas are coming from other coffee shops around town.

Epoch Coffee ," 3/20/2014 Updated review 6 check-ins This was my favorite new discovery, but sadly it did not last. Parking had always been awful, but there has not been any seating the last two times I've gone in and prices were just increased $0.50 for all drinks (except the cortado, I think). I know $0.50 isn't a lot, but the original prices were already higher than Starbucks and I don't feel like Epoch deserves any slack for mispricing when they have had another store open for years to experiment with. Also, my usual cappuccino had always been served in their bigger cups (about 12 oz) and they just recently downsized all drinks (except mochas, as far as I can tell) to their small cups (about 8 oz).  Updated prices, for reference:  Cappuccino: $3.25 to $3.75 (Starbucks Tall = $2.75) Latte: $3.50 to $4.00 (Starbucks Tall = $2.75) Mocha: $3.75 to $4.25 (Starbucks Tall = $3.25) Drip: $2.00 to $2.50 (Starbucks Tall = $1.65)  If you're rich and willing to pay a buck more for less coffee, of course Epoch tastes better.

Epoch Coffee ," 12/18/2013 118 check-ins Listed in ""Nuptial Coffee Bliss!"", Anderson Lane is the new Black This new Anderson Epoch bears the same resemblance with its North Loop sibling as I have with my own sister - absolutely none. I should probably disclose I don't actually have a sister.  And since we're in disclosing mode, let me mention my coffee consumption has gone from two quarts a day to less than two cups, because it's my worst trigger for smoking ever. The point being nothing pisses me off quicker these days than tepid swill posing as coffee. That puts me in a really really, dark place.     I'm happy to report this new Epoch is all sunshine and rainbows. Their $2 house pour using my cup was wonderful. They have Russell's pastries, a real kitchen from 10am-2pm, and WiFi blazing at 10m-down. A laid-back & friendly staff who appear to enjoy working there. And granted this place is brand-spanking new, but it's so clean and sterile here that you can literally do coffee bean surgery right off the floor. If you want to feel personality, head over to the North Loop Epoch, you'll have to give this Anderson Epoch a little more time to develop.    The bottom line is let's see how they fare, with Starbie's around the corner and Genuine Joe's up the street. Maybe they're shooting for the post-Alamo crowd, or the Anderson Lane lunch-hoppers. Maybe if you build it, they will come. I do know this new Epoch has good coffee and it's a pleasant respite. In this particular hip & cool gentrified section of town, it's almost quietly epic. No particular reason why I like this pic, I just do. Okay, I like playing with contrasts & angles. They make a pretty cortado here for $3. Awww, coffee art.

Epoch Coffee ," 1/24/2016 This is one of the better executed coffee shops that we have visited in Austin. There is plenty of seating, different types of seating, spread out, outdoor even. The music is loud enough to blend the noises but not enough to take over your brain. We can't speak to the coffee. For us, coffee is either drinkable or not: it was fine. We didn't try the wifi which is normally important to us but other reviewers said it is fine. The only suggestion is to integrate some textile into the decor to absorb some of the background noise given all of the hard surfaces. ", pos

Epoch Coffee ," 3/17/2015 1 check-in Listed in Coffee Houses We were visiting our friends in Austin and we stopped in to grab coffeee. The parking lot was super busy too. We walked in and the coffee shop has a ton of room for people to meet up/study. I got the Chai latte and they make their own Chai which isn't as sweet as others. I really liked it and we sat to chat for a while.  If I was still a student in austin, I'd probably come by here to study. My student-self was looking at all the tables and outlets. ", pos 
Epoch Coffee , 1/11/2014 1 check-in Cute location and relaxed feel if you want to get away and have a nice secluded conversation with a friend. Nice couches and plenty of tables for studying and enjoying all the lovely items Epoch has to offer.  Epoch served me my FIRST cappuccino and I'm HOOKED! Freakin baby cup gave me the shakes at 11:30pm and now I can't wait to go back. It also didn't help that I chased that down with their tea. Ben was such a sweetheart and told us he would do a second steeping on our tea. I loved everything about this place and can't wait to visit again. I wish there were more laid back/spacious coffee houses in San Antonio! Austinites are SPOILED! My first cappuccino! Oh so good! , pos

Epoch Coffee ," 4/2/2016 Good coffee, great location. Lots places to eat after. Had a  croissant that was fairly hard, so wasn't impressed with pastry selection. Study spot wise, it depends on the people working that day. There seems to always be louder music playing, and not the kind you can easily tune out, with certain people working. Genuine joes us better for studying on those days, even though its smaller. ", pos

Epoch Coffee ," 8/7/2015 Good coffee, tea, and good food.  I'm a big fan of East Side so I of course loved their pizza.  No issues with the staff or Internet.  The parking can be a little weird with the theater next door but that just means a bit further of a walk.  Ultimately the 5 stars come from the fact that there's nothing around it to compete.  Starbucks is ... well, you know.   Genuine Joe experiences have been mixed. ", pos

Epoch Coffee , 3/12/2016 So much improvement!!! This place has totally turned it around since they opened. That was rocky. Now it's lovely. The staff is great it's clean. Drinks are on point. Great job guys. Oh and the bottled water helps support drug and alcohol recovery so that's awesome! , pos 
Epoch Coffee ," 3/8/2016 If you ever are looking to grab a cup of coffee you should give this place a try at least once. I have not had many things here as I feel the only thing I need is the Iced Mojo, but based purely on the Iced Mojo itself I highly recommend it. No need for creamer or sugar it is good to go!  The staff/employees do provide the service expected but do not go above and beyond.  Cozy environment, not as hipster as some of the Epochs closer to downtown. ", pos 
Epoch Coffee ," 11/25/2015 Good coffee- the baristas were great. I use to be a barista so when I get a taste of a good cup of black I really appreciate it. The energy seemed a bit lacking in the atmosphere this morning. But that could just be me, otherwise I'd give it 5 stars. ", pos

Epoch Coffee ," 12/28/2014 1 check-in Pretty nice place here, very good environment for studying if you can in a coffee house environment. I got some coconut chai tea without milk and it cost around $4. The only complaint I would have was that after I finished the tea, there were these little bugs flying around and into my cup and it was a bit disgusting. Other than the fly problem, it was pretty good place and tea. The flies are an easy problem to get rid of. Coconut Chai Latte ", pos 
Epoch Coffee ," 9/27/2014 1 check-in Just have to say that I stopped by Epoch because Genuine Joe doesn't understand the concept of staying open during their posted times and how that affects customer service.    So my g/f and I walk in and the place is packed, but the line is small.  Apparently this was the place to be on a Saturday night.  We walk up to the counter and the barista was super nice.  Answered all our questions and treated each customer before us, to include us, like we were friends.  Small conversation and just being genuinely nice.    Cappuccino was apparently the best one my g/f had ever experienced.  I had a blood orange tea that was unique and delicious.  I really like that they fill their own tea bags.  The set up is made for studying, so if you want to have a conversation, it's a bit awkward, but not that bad.  They have some table games and couch/lounge areas to be a bit more secluded and play games. ", pos 
Epoch Coffee ," 7/9/2014 Updated review I like Epoch coffee still. Clean lines, fast wifi, great A/C, new outside seating. I haven't resampled food and I'm not going to buy those pastries sitting there since 8am.  Here's the gig though. It's been 7 months and that bathroom is still a broken down mess. The door to the second stall is still off. The towel dispenser is hanging open like a gaping maw with sodden roll of towel on top. The one bathroom that does function has grimy floors and the TP is off the roll sitting on the handicap bar.  There are 30 people in here and one lonely barista trying to do it all which makes wait times long and her life miserable (I'm sure.) I expect some of these things at the old location which is arguably less put together but I thought they'd fix some of these things in the half year they've been open. ", neutral 
Epoch Coffee ," 10/15/2014 4 check-ins That area needed a good coffeehouse and this was it. I was sick and tired of going to a coffeehouse which I'm going to name but I'll give you a hint - they have private events scheduled and they will kick you out of the room. Then you have to fend for yourself. I didn't want to go to Starbucks either. It's a nice area with old school furniture and there are board games.  Their coffee hits the spot. If I'm in the area, this is where I'm going to get some good coffee. ", pos 
Epoch Coffee ," 1/31/2016 I like this place, even though I've recently sworn off caffeine (mostly). The service is nice and the selection of teas and snacks is good. I got a burnt (like, ""why did you think it was okay to put these ingredients into the tortilla?,"" burnt) breakfast taco, emailed them (nicely!) about it, and they gave me a gift card to apologize.  I do wish they could better control noise, and have more outlets for laptops, but if you go prepared with headphones and a full battery you'll enjoy your experience. ", pos 
Epoch Coffee , 7/25/2016 Love this place. I usually get the mocha with almond milk. Always good. They serve Tyson's breakfast tacos in the morning. Baristas are always friendly. Plenty of tables and wifi. Great spot to chill or get out of the office. , pos 
Epoch Coffee ," 7/29/2015 I have been to this place a couple of times -- usually Saturday afternoons.  I have to say their iced coffee is good, albeit a little on the acidic side (which is somewhat typical in cold brews anyway).   They make amaaaaazing espresso -- very smooth and drinkable.  People who work here seem decent and knowledgable.  I haven't ever had an issue I needed resolved, so I'm not entirely sure how they handle that sort of thing.  Prices are a couple quarters more than I would expect on most drinks.  Nice chill vibe in the shop, and lots of seating.  Girl's bathroom is really spacious and clean.  Overall, pretty good -- but definitely not the end all. ", pos 
Epoch Coffee ," 11/2/2014 292 check-ins My neighborhood was low on local coffee shops, so I was thrilled when Epoch opened a new location right around the corner. I like the original location ok, but this one suits my style a bit more. (Yeah, I know, I'm a bit of yuppie.) They also display local artists work.  There's lots of comfortable seating: several couches, lots of tables for working, and a patio out back. The baristas are always friendly and willing to debate you on which Star Wars movie is best, plus they make a mean cortado.  NOTE: They FINALLY fixed that second door in the ladies room a couple months ago. ", pos 
Epoch Coffee ," 5/10/2015 The drinks here are pretty top notch, especially if you consider your options in the area. Usually they only have one person working up front, which for me is fine, never the impatient one.  Russell's pastry's are offered from the front counter which I've never been a fan of, but this review is based solely on the coffee & the service I've received. Not sure why people are annoyed that they sit out all day. I've worked at many places that sell pastries (including whole foods) if you think they are being rotated out in an hourly basis, you're not very food smart..  I usually order a cortado & it never really disappoints. Texas coffee traders is served for ice coffee instead of the cuvée that is used for espresso. I love TCT & wish they would be able to shine a bit more in Austin. The tea selection here is pretty good, I get the white blueberry iced sometimes, haven't been to very many places that offer fancy teas, cooled.  The only thing that bugs me is the barista will often ignore me when I'm next in line & loudly chat to a friend that has walked in behind me. Usually the friends order is taken first & then I'm left with a smug, ""what can I get you?"" I know this isn't the owner, who is kinda quiet, which doesn't bother me. Just something that irks me.. I'm a regular, but not a stay too long chatty kind of person. This of course doesn't deter me from coming back, just an excuse for a soul eye roll.  All in all I really like the vibe of this place, it's always really clean, the music is perfect in the AM, the coffee is delicious & they have a good patio in the back. ", pos 
Epoch Coffee ," 7/18/2014 2 check-ins Listed in 100 reviews in 2014? Done and Done and Done., I'm pretty much a coffee shop expert. Epoch's expansion, Circa 13 is ok... just ok.  I REALLY like the original Epoch... it's pretty much got the coffee shop game on lock... this one... feels too clean... and kindof empty.  That emptiness is what I'm basing this review on.  The staff at Epoch are always chill and great people... and the coffee is always great as well.... but this place is just missing something... the character that the original Epoch has.. it's just not there.  If you're at Korea House or in the area and don't want to travel to get coffee, this is a great spot...and definitely better than the Starbucks just a few blocks away... but otherwise, I wouldn't really go out of my way to go here.

Epoch Coffee ," 9/19/2015 This place had a cute atmosphere, plenty of comfortable seating, extremely amiable staff, and just a generally pleasant place to work. Unfortunately I have to dock it for it's coffee though. I haven't tried everything, but the few drinks I've had were ok at best. I haven't tried the food or the tea so I'm not reviewing those, but I do wish the coffee were better. That being said, I like sweet drinks so if you don't, then you'll probably like it more than I did. ", pos 
Epoch Coffee ," 9/27/2015 This Epoch has a nice environment and a very Austin vibe. The tea is good, it's usually fairly quiet, mostly the background music and some faint chatter of what I assume are students.  I've had problems connecting to Wifi almost every time though. There are two options, one for the front, one for the back, but either way I still get problems.  Overall, it's nice, and I'd be okay coming here to hang out, but studying on a laptop becomes risky with the hit or miss internet connection. ", neutral

Epoch Coffee ," 2/19/2014 3 check-ins Listed in 2014 Yelp 100 Challenge, West Anderson? Best Anderson., The best part of waking up is Cuvée in your cup! Let me tell you a thing - this place is just the cutest. Everybody already knows that I have a favorite coffee shop in Austin, but I decided that I could have a south Austin favorite and a north Austin favorite, but the south Austin favorite is still number one. Wait, maybe they can be tied for first because I don't want either of them to feel second best.  It doesn't matter what time of day I come here - the staff members are just straight up adorable. They ask you about your day and they care about your answer; heck, they'll even have a full on conversation with you! The standard, ""Hi, how are you?"" is not just an automated response here; it's a genuine question backed by real curiosity. Call me a sucker for human warmth, but, well... okay, I'm just a sucker for that kind of thing. (When I worked in retail, I tried to do the exact same thing because seeing someone's face light up when they see that you are actually engaging them as a person instead of treating them as yet another customer is positively wonderful. It's the little things that matter most, you know?)  They serve Cuvée coffee here, which is my favorite type of coffee and pretty much the only coffee I will drink. I went from never drinking coffee to only drinking one specific brand of coffee. My brain is so silly sometimes. The one time I ordered a hot chocolate, I asked if they could sprinkle cinnamon on the top because that is my favorite way to drink hot chocolate, and they informed me that they use a Mexican chocolate that already has cinnamon in it. They did not lie and that hot chocolate just might be my favorite hot chocolate in Austin.  Then there's the story of how I went on one of the cutest first dates ever - I suggested Epoch because it was centrally located to my office and his apartment. As we were ordering, I mentioned that this was our first date and the barista said, ""No way. You're kidding, right?"" I laughed and told him, no, I was not kidding. ""I never would have guessed. It seems like you two have known each other for forever."" I took this as a good sign since I had literally met this guy not one minute before that exchange.  The date went very well and we stayed there chatting for some time. At some point, maybe two hours in, the same barista walks to our table with a slice of cheesecake and says, ""Because it seems like your first date is going well."" My heart melted right then and there. How thoughtful is that? He brought us a slice of cheesecake because our date was going well. I just can't get over how sweet that gesture was.  I just can't even with how cute this place is and how warm and fuzzy it makes me feel inside. Everyone here is so thoughtful and kind and genuine and there's something about that that I just love. I live for those connections, however small, because it's those connections that keep us all going at the end of the day, and any place that makes my inner social worker sing has found a forever fan in me.

Epoch Coffee ," 3/10/2014 8 check-ins Listed in 2014 Yelp Challenge, Coffee addicts, step up! What the F is a cortado? I didn't know, so I ordered it. And surprisingly, I liked it. I still don't know what it is, so don't ask me.  This is another version of the ever so popular, open 24 hour coffee shop on North Loop. This one is not open 24/7, they have human hours.  I like this new location. Its in the Village Shopping Center (near the Alamo DH). The inside needs help. It doesn't feel like a coffee shop. It needs some pizzazz! Something to set it apart. But there is plenty of seating which the other location will never have due to its proximity to campus. They also have a small kitchen, therefore a lot more options for food here. An outside patio is available for smokers and nice weather observers.  On a strange and sadder note: To add to Kelly S's review, the women's restroom is the saddest restroom I've ever seen. There is one stall, and the 2nd one has no door on it. The bathroom reminds me of a bare, sad hospital bathroom. They don't even have good hand soap. They've got that 99cent shit from HEB in there.  However, I like coffee, the W. Anderson Lane area, and Topo Chico :-) ", pos 
Epoch Coffee ," 3/14/2014 8 check-ins Listed in Caffeine Boost In comparison to the original Epoch, I'm a huge fan. There's parking, open tables, and light! And the bathroom doesn't scare you. High fives all around.  I'm still a fan of the other Epoch, but this one suites me a bit more. They offer Cuvee coffee and will brew it up via Chemex or Clever. The drip coffee is cheap, and refills are only $1. The mocha here is still good, but you can only go Mexican mocha. The beloved mojo is still here as well. They've got solid food menu (from what it seems), but  it's only available until 3pm.  Big space. Most tables are only for two people, so it's not great for big groups. There's some nice couch space  and bar seating here also. The wi-fi can be spotty though, so that's one knack on it.  Solid shop. ", pos 
Epoch Coffee ," 2/25/2015 My favorite coffee shop. Pros: lots of room, comfy seating, 2 very strong wifi networks, a patio, often good music is playing, like Jeff Buckley, instead of that horrible coffee house music you get in places Cons: pastry selection isn't very broad, dine-in cups are so wide that the coffee goes cold quickly ", pos 
Epoch Coffee ," 1/28/2014 1 check-in So- I love coffee shops.  I especially love coffee shops with sofas ( really the only way to work). I love a barista that can make a really good latte. I love a reasonably quiet place to work and chat. This Epoch new location hits all of those on the nose.  My soy latte was so delicious- really really good espresso, creamy milk- that I didnt even need sugar ( and that's saying a lot for me.)  The only downside. It's already way too popular. The line to get coffee stretched around the bar and halfway to the door. We waited about 45 mins before daring to get in line. Also ( and I am sure its because they are new) they were out of almost everything- mocha syrup, decaf beans ( mine was the last.) Being popular can have its downsides sometimes, but I am sure that it will work out the kinks for the future. ", pos

Epoch Coffee ," 12/20/2013 21 check-ins ROTD 4/28/2014 This review isn't really fair.   I feel like Epoch Coffee moved into this W. Anderson location because I WILLED it to happen.  The cosmos knew I wanted an excellent cafe in the empty space next to our office, and they made it happen.    I couldn't be happier.  First, I appreciate the design/layout.  They leased a long, narrow, weird-shaped, old space and made it BEAUTIFUL.   This is not an easy feat.  I know, I tried to do the same with our office location.  You can tell that the design was very well thought out.  Lots of warm woods, excellent lighting, art on the walls, and seating that satisfies the hard-working lone-wolf and the socialite.    I really love the ordering area.  The minimal aesthetic brings the focus to what they do best: coffee.   They have pour-overs, several selections of beans and grinds, and (the pièce de résistance) the incredible Strada espresso machine.   If you are a coffee connoisseur, you won't be disappointed.    As for the food, I am thrilled.  I like to eat healthy.  Our office is surrounded by some of the best food in Austin (Bartletts, Phonatic, Hopdoddy, Verts etc) but we don't have a lot of healthy alternatives.  Last time I ate at Epoch, I had an incredible Vegan Club sandwich.  It is very cool that a place that specializes in coffee can make food this good.  Most importantly, the people there are awesome.  Everyone on our team loves going to Epoch and talking to their team.   They like great music, they know coffee, and they are extremely friendly.   I am big fan, and I will be in Epoch often.

The coffee, tea, and food selection is good, but that's not why you come to Epoch!  You come here because you need some downtime, maybe on a couch, with some wifi and isolation.  Or you come here because you need a quiet place to chat with a friend or three.  Or you can come here to play games with folks.  It all works at Epoch.

When I got there, nobody was at the counter for me to order but he popped out from the back after a bit and apologized. Genuine smile, so, of course, he was forgiven.  I always get the Mexican mocha or an iced Mojo from Epoch so I got the Mexican mocha to see how this one compared to the original location. Crazy tasty!  This location has a more modern feel to it than the other location, which is nice...I like having diversity without having to sacrifice deliciousness!

Epoch Coffee ," 3/17/2014 I live right by the original Epoch on North Loop. It's typically packed - as is Monkey Nest - so it's good to see another coffee shop open up in the area. I hope that this will provide some much needed relief.  It's a fairly small place, but the space is well utilized. Couches at the front provide lots of seating for socialization. Along the side wall is a row of two-seater tables good for those on a date or (as most people were) working on laptops. There are about three 4-seater tables in the back. It also seemed that they had a back patio.  Small selection of pastries from Russell's bakery. They also have a kitchen that makes sandwiches and salads from 10-2.

Epoch Coffee ," 1/16/2014 1 check-in I did a happy dance when the permit went up for Epoch many months ago because we could really use a non-chain coffee purveyor with good hangout space on Anderson Lane. (Yes, I know Genuine Joe's is just down the road, but it has heating/cooling issues and you roll the dice on surly service each and every time.)  I finally paid Epoch a visit and am pleased. It's the brighter, cleaner cousin to the original outpost on North Loop. You'll still have a smattering of hipsters and quite a few gamers, but they peaceably coexist alongside solo students with their noses in books and chatty friends catching up on their week. There are tables, benches, sofas, comfy chairs, plentiful outlets...something for everyone.  Unlike a previous reviewer who found the service abrasive, I was struck by how friendly the barista and the fellow who gave me the wi-fi password were. I enjoyed my piping hot, cinnamon-y mocha so much that I also sipped away on my husband's when he declared his too strong. The only hiccup was the temperature of the building. Um, was that my breath I just saw? It was really freakin' cold. (And that says a lot, coming from someone who typically runs hot). Oh, and as others have mentioned, it's not a great spot for a snack unless you happen to roll in between 10am and 2pm. Huh? I hope they expand their food hours over time.  Despite my quibbles, I'm so glad to have Epoch (aka Circa 13) in the 'hood. ", pos 
Epoch Coffee ," 2/21/2015 11 check-ins My go-to spot for a latte. They really know what they're doing (coffee-wise.) Lattes usually include a beautiful latte-art design for your (brief) viewing pleasure before you happily drink it down. When the weather is warm, get an iced mojo. Creamy and sweet iced coffee that's gotten me through quite a few study sessions. If super sweet is not your thing, order a half iced mojo. Food- they usually have a fairly good selection of pastries, although they're in this weird, very low-to-the-ground glass case that's built into the counter (can anyone explain to me what's up with that? You're selling scones, not diamond earrings) I digress.. If you need something more substantial to snack on, they sell pizza by the slice from Eastside Pies (try the circa! Feta. Broccoli. Sweet potato. Strange yet oh-so delicious.)  My ONLY reason for not giving these guys five stars is the customer service. It's like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get. ", pos

Stinson’s ," 4/11/2016 Updated review The owner of Stinson's reached out to me and wholeheartedly expressed concern for our previous experience, we appreciated his efforts to make it right so yesterday we stopped in to give it a second shot. Our second visit was a total 180 flip, the service was great and attentive and the food came out quickly. I really do enjoy the atmosphere and what they've done with the location.  Their lattes are delicious, hot but never bitter. I tried the cool cucumber sandwich this time around, it was crisp and light and yummy. During this visit there were crunchy and savory home-made tortilla chips that came with our sandwiches, we never received chips with our meals the first time so I'm not sure if this was something new or not but I dug them.  We'll definitely be back to Stinson's, my only slight hesitation is that the food, in my opinion, is priced a little high for what it is. So perhaps not a frequent stop, but we'll be back nonetheless. ", pos

Came for lunch and they have a food truck outside with great items. Coffee is delish and they have italian sodas too. Did you know they have a bar with happy hour specials?  Ozzy was great in helping me pick my drinks and we ordered pizzas and chips and salsa. They have muffins (pumpkin was awesome) We just needed a neeting spot and some snacks. This was perfect and we loved the vibe. We will definitely be back to try more food off the menu as well as check out the happy hour scene.  Big bench tables and low music for a great atmosphere. Total cool austin hangout so stop in and visit them. ", pos

Very cool converted mechanic's garage / gas station with that unique Austin vibe.  They have a nice patio area, and main seating area inside can be opened to the outside using the big roll up doors left in place from the mechanic's garage, so you can sit inside and still enjoy the nice weather.

Stinson’s ," 8/23/2015 Great hang-out spot at the corner of Burnett and 45th street.  Coffee, meals, full bar, dessert, wifi and great AC all in a converted service garage.  Lunch at 11 on a Sunday was uncrowded and the service was fast.  Order at counter, find a seat and wait not too long for food to be delivered to the table.  I expect that Stinson's can get quite loud when fully occupied, since the space is surrounded with many hard surfaces, and can pack quite a few people within its relatively small space    The arugula and cranberry salad was very fresh and a good portion.  I added grilled chicken and the chicken was moist and well-flavored.  Grilled Angus Burger was very good as well.  The only complaint was that the bun was a little dry, but overall this was a very tasty and satisfying burger.  The side of fries was piping hot when the burger was brought to the table.  We ordered a soy chai latte and regular latte to go.  The chai mix was a very nice blend with a noticeable hint of ginger.  The latte was average.  But the main places that come to mind that have better lattes specialize and focus on coffee.  So average for the breadth of what Stinson's is was quite fine.  Stinson's is a great place to visit any time of day for good beverages (for there or to go), good food and socializing. ", pos 
Stinson’s ," 3/8/2016 I'm a big fan of Stinson's. I'm here pretty much every other weekday morning cranking out good work over their gloriously fast (5Ghz available) wifi and a steaming cup of almond milk latte.  Stinson's doesn't try to be ""Austin hip"", and it doesn't need to be. If I wanted cramped spaces, wobbly tables, and fighting for plugs, I'd just head to any number of other Austin coffee shops. Instead, what you get here is a really clean, surprisingly large space that serves both coffee and real food (not the traditional panini press sandwiches coffee shops normally put out).  I will say that while the prices for drinks are fairly reasonable, food prices are a tad bit high. I honestly don't mind though. Coffee shops don't make enough margins as is. If that's what it takes to keep the lights on, 5Ghz wifi pumping, and caffeine flowing, I am entirely happy to support that. ", pos 
Stinson’s ," 12/17/2015 1 check-in I would rate this place ""Alright"" just alright. The guy working the counter/cashier was far from welcoming. He never even greeted us or said hi. The food was good but EXTREMELY over priced. We ordered 2 chicken sandwiches and 1 drink our total was over 30 bucks. It was very slow and the food did seem to take awhile. Again the customer service was really lacking and I probably won't be returning to this place. If you never stopped in to eat here I really don't think you would be missing much! ", neutral 
Stinson’s ," 3/1/2016 Updated review 2 check-ins Lots of natural light, decent food, alcoholic and caffeinated beverages, and 3 tables with outlets. They have everything I need to get things done on my laptop.    It's always a little awkward to interact with staff. It could be the food and coffee counter immediately inside the front door. They do make an effort, which I appreciate. They don't bring you cutlery, napkins, or condiments with your food. These things can be found at the right end of the bar. No place to grab an extra napkin. Awkward. ", pos

My friend and I were able to talk easily without feeling like we were bothering anyone. Mostly everyone had their headphones in but the music was chill- think Radiohead. I had the iced coffee which was good and the egg & bacon sandwich which was only okay. The parking lot is small, but I got here at Sunday at 11:15 and there were still plenty of spaces. I would say it's best to come alone or with a close friend. ", pos 
Stinson’s , 5/30/2015 Updated review Had to return with my son. We both got their 100% angus beef burger and fries. The burgers were excellent. Hands down our favorite.

Friendly and courteous staff.  My order was up pretty quick.  Chips with the spicy salsa were good- tastes homemade which is nice :)  Chicken salad on arugula had a nice flavor but I would have liked it to be a bit colder and have a few added veggies or something .

Thought that was pretty funny and awesome. Just an example of how friendly and accommodating the employees are. As far as the food goes, I've had a great lunch (salad), breakfast taco and buttered coffee there -- all tasty! One of the walls is a garage door, which they open when it's nice out. In addition to the service and food, the fresh air makes it a really enjoyable place to stop and grab a bite/drink or sit down and work. ", pos 
Stinson’s ," 5/4/2014 Updated review 4 check-ins Listed in ""Nuptial Coffee Bliss!"" Wow, it's been a year since I wrote about this place? They definitely deserve an update: Their original trailer thing was okay, but this brick & mortar on 45th & Burnet is great. The interior is great, the staff is great, the WiFi is great, and their plain & simple hot & black coffee is great. The parking here is not great.    Don't know much about their food, their beer/wine/booze, or their history and biology for that matter. What I do know is I love hanging in coffeehouses, because I can play on my phone and drink coffee for long long time. And when there's parking available around here, Stinson's is a great place to do it. Lots of coffee choices up and down Burnet these days, have some fun with them. Now this interior beats their former outside trailer any day... ", pos 
Stinson’s , 9/4/2015 1 check-in Tried the mocha latte this afternoon. It was so-so. Definitely not something to write home about. They did use chocolate from Ghirardelli's though.

Stinson’s ," 3/13/2015 Updated review Wanted to update my review on Stinson's since I spent an entire day here last weekend (ate all my meals and numerous cups of coffee while furiously working on a deadline).  Holy shit - you must all try their veggie burger. I asked for a recommendation and am really happy that I tried this one. The veggies were great - it was heavy, satisfying, and fresh all at the same time. The flavor wasn't overwhelmingly strong, but there was enough spice to keep it interesting. The turkey sandwich was amazing as well.  Other great features? Lots of large tables! Places to plug in your computer, a bar, or the ability to move many tables together to bring in a big group for dinner. Huge fan.  Will be back again, please don't hate me guys (I promise to buy plenty of food and not be a complete waste of space!). ", pos

Stinson’s ," 6/18/2015 Coffee shops are delightfully in abundance in Austin, but some of them can get incredibly crowded, loud, or just don't have outlets for your laptop. Stinsons was great in that it wasn't over crowded at all while I was there and had a pleasant ambience. Combine that with plenty of electrical outlets and good sized tables to work on, and I was impressed!  I got a chai latte, which was disappointingly syrup-y and had a strange taste. The pumpkin muffin is fantastic! And the coffee was really good too, some of the better coffee I've had in the area actually.  The barista who took my orders wasn't smile-friendly, and she seemed a bit brusque. I gave her a smile and a pleasant hello, and I seemed to sense the tiniest bit of thaw in her demeanor. That and the terrible chai were what knocked a star off, but otherwise, this is a great spot I plan to frequent again to do work! ", pos

Stinson’s ," 2/13/2016 I go here to work every couple of weeks when I want a treat. They have good wifi, a gorgeous grilled cheese sandwich,  and a delicious coffee cocktail.  I CRAVE their coffee cocktails. If they had comfy seating,  I'd probably be in there every day. ", pos

Stinson’s ," 8/7/2014 1 check-in One word of advice: don't come if you're in a rush. Come on a relaxing day where you have time to kill.  Absolutely loved the decor inside & the big windows with natural light. Their choice in lighting reminds me of an old laboratory from the 50's. Wood & brick accents throughout.  It is SUPRISINGLY open & big with ample seating indoors & outdoors. Probably an ok place to bring a few friends (only a bigger group if you're ok sitting outdoors). But most people seem to come just to read and relax and study or for a quick bite. Pretty quiet... wouldn't bring kids unless they can entertain themselves.    They also have a quite a few spots for parking.    Honestly, I'm not a coffee drinker, so I can't give you much info on that, but their croissant and chocolate croissants were not great. I love croissants, so I'm always looking for new places that offer them.... but I couldn't even finish half of either croissant.    Service wasn't particularly friendly or fast either. They worked at a sloth-like pace, which probably isn't ideal for the typical ""crap-I'm-running-late-but-I-need-coffee"" person. ", neutral 
Stinson’s ," 12/26/2014 1 check-in I love when a trailer is successful enough they can convert to a bricks-and-mortar hangout and not lose any of their charm. One of the benefits of these guys being in the area (Rosedale)for a while, is they know their market! Excellent espresso machines pull fabulous shots.  Comfortable indoor seating with a real (liquor) bar & 2 TV screens for watching the game.  It seems like they have captured a good mix of ""something for everyone"", without feeling like a big box chain.  Outside tables under a covered patio provide space for a gathering or place to chat and enjoy freshness outdoors.  (Also another flat screen TV here.)    Located just across from Upper Crust bakery they also serve lunch and bistro food, as well as pastries Russell's bakery. Espreso trailer turned bricks & mortar.

Stinson’s ," 8/5/2014 1 check-in A friend and I were looking for a place to meet, catch up, and grab a drink. We chose Stinson's, since it's close to both our houses. As other Yelper's have mentioned, parking is a pain, only 3 spots out front. Also, no bike parking, at least not that I saw.  They have happy hour, which surprised me. Reduced wine and beer, no cocktail specials. The food menu looked meh. We would have ordered something to share, but they didn't have good shared plate options (chips and salsa, brushetta, or hummus were really the only options). Not was you'd expect from a ""bistro.""  We were sweating our butts off inside. They don't have any ceiling fans and only one of the garage doors was open. When we went outside to leave, it was cooler outside than in (and it was about 90 degrees out). I'm not sure I'd make this place a regular hang out. ", neutral 
Stinson’s ," 5/22/2015 I'm going to make this short and sweet. I am the kind of person who values customer service above cuisine---if you serve okay food and have outstanding customer service then you will have regulars lined up every day. Well, the girl who they hired as the cashier needs a serious attitude adjustment. No smile, no hi how are you?...I did all the talking and she just nodded. Then when she walked over to give me my food to-go she basically threw it at me. She didn't say one word as she pivoted on her heel and walked back to the front to continue playing with her phone.  Shame---the burger is actually quite good, but if I have to look forward to that kind of reception I don't think i'll be back anytime soon. ", neutral 
Stinson’s , 1/28/2016 I had the burger. It was ok. Nothing special.  It's a cool hangout. They have a nice patio. Sometimes they have a couple of people playing guitar outside. That's fun to watch and drink beer. Wish they had more beer selections. , neutral

Stinson’s ," 7/6/2014 1 check-in I feel like this brick-and-mortar location is a work in progress.  As the parking lot belies, it seems thrown together in kind of a hurry.  I was a bit disappointed by lunch offerings and settled on the grilled four cheese sandwich since my server recommended it as one of her favorites.  It was a panini style simple grilled cheese on toasted wheat bread that I could have easily made for myself at home.  It came with plain pita chips and a single cut up strawberry.  My latte was fine, but it wasn't the best coffee in a town full of excellent choices. Grilled cheese ", neutral

Stinson’s ," 4/11/2015 Updated review Since my last review the owner, John, reached out to me. I cannot say enough good things about the level of customer service he provided! It was enough to make me give them another chance. They were, again, out of the first thing I ordered, which was a veggie burger. Reading Rebekah P.'s review I wish they hadn't been because it sounds like it would've been amazing! My chicken sandwich wasn't bad though and the fries were so good!  The owner and manager, Ozzy, have gone to great lengths to change my mind about Stinson's and they truly have succeeded. They recognize the business' flaws and are working hard to change them. I believe that they will get it right and Stinson's will be that much better for it. The way a business handles challenges can make or break an experience, and for me, they have truly made me believe in the future of this place.  I'm not counting Stinson's out yet! ", pos 
Stinson’s , 12/10/2015 I recently discovered Stinsons at an alumni meeting they host monthly. What a treat. The coffee and breakfast tacos are delicious. I like the lattes in the extra large cups.

Stinson’s ," 5/6/2014 This area needed another coffer shop and I'm glad it was Stinson's that moved in. Despite the gas station exterior, the inside is gorgeously decorated. Garage doors let in ample light, great for getting work done.  Coffee bar is first when you walk in, food and booze bar is to the left. I like that it is separated so that you can easily get a cup to go without having to wade through a bunch of tables to get to the counter.  Chicken salad sandwich was good although I didn't like that it was served with pita chips. My friend got a pizza which looked and smelled delicious. I will definitely get that next time.  Overall, better food offerings than most coffee shops and a really cool vibe with friendly people. Parking is bad, though we found 1 hour parking on the street. ", pos 
Stinson’s ," 3/4/2015 Updated review Okay, Stinson's.  I'm finally knocking you one star... but only because I care about you. I feel like there is so much untapped potential at this nicely renovated, perfectly located coffee shop/cafe/bar.  There are two problems, though, that are preventing you from achieving true five star greatness:  1) I usually stop in within 30 min of opening on Sat or Sun mornings for drip coffee, and lately the temperature of my beverage has been just warm.  Definitely not hot. By the time I walk the short distance back to my house, I have to heat it up in the microwave.  Are you serving yesterday's leftover coffee that hasn't had enough time to heat up fully, or what?   2) I can expect to wait about 10-15 minutes for my coffee if there are 2 people in line in front of me.  Nobody seems to really hustle around this place, and everything moves at a pretty relaxed speed.  Otherwise, I think everyone who works here is very friendly, and I'm still loving the baked goods from Russell's, and my dog is a huge fan of the complimentary dog treats.  Also, since you've started to make the breakfast tacos out of the trailer on order, they've greatly improved and are pretty delicious. ", pos

Stinson’s ," 4/18/2014 1 check-in Love that they open at 6:30 because usually the only other place around that time that I go to is Houndstooth, and I want them to think that I actually go other places.  For the longest time, I couldn't get over the fact that this place used to be a ghetto-looking gas station revived with some fresh paint. After visiting for a morning meet-up at 6:30 (that's a different story), I have to say that I love it. They nail the industrial operating-behind-a-garage-door thing well but the interior is still classy feeling. Plenty of seating. Pastry case (unfilled at that visit).  Even though it seems like you can see right through it when you drive by, the interior is cozy. Good choice of warm lighting, clean bottles and supplies displayed for aesthetics, and has a full bar and happy hour. The coffee is great and decently priced. I realized I was given a small instead of a medium, but it was early so it's alright and the girl is sweet.  Parking is difficult at that corner but a great neighborhood walk.

The best barista is by far Lauren, who knows what you want before you even get to the counter! She is so friendly too! THeir honey bee latte is a fun twist on the classic drink and they are constantly coming up with new yummy recipes.  The lunch menu is great and quick too! Pizza, sandwiches, and even a black bean salad for the health conscious. I had the black bean salad and their breakfast pastries before and they are all very good.

Stinson’s ," 12/7/2013 4 check-ins Listed in ATX Coffee Fix Currently, Stinson's operates from a trailer in front of their soon-to-be completed brick and mortar store. Their coffee, muffins and sandwiches are solid. The croissant sandwiches are more similar to kolaches in that they incorporate the ham/turkey/spinach/cheese as a filling rather than a typical sandwich. It is a little on the chewy/soft side.  I've found parking to be difficult with the limited space and its very close proximity to the street. I've found it worthwhile parking a block away so it's not hard to get back into traffic.

If you're lucky, you'll get Lauren to make your coffee concoction- seriously the girl can't make a bad drink, she's probably magic or something.  She  also has a really awesome name (I'm super lame I know).  The inside of Stinson's is really adorable and  full of natural light- the place is cheerful as fuck.  Currently, there's an old classic movie starring Humphrey Bogart being projected on the wall with subtitles and Frank Sinatra filling the sound waves.  Great place to get some work done- the wifi is pretty fast!  I could also see this place being great for events or brunch with the girls :)  10,000,000,000,000 bonus points for having no dirty hipsters here!  PLEASE DON'T TELL YOUR HIPSTER FRIENDS, YELPERS!

Stinson’s ," 3/22/2013 9 check-ins Listed in Caffeine Boost, Burnet wins., Austin Food Carts Yes, this blue trailer on 45th and Burnet IS open!  I came by this morning for a quick caffeine fix, and I was pleasantly surprised to find several tables for seating and a nice big screen tv! Of course, at 9am, it was on Sports Center instead of the news..  I got a regular sized iced coffee for $2.11 after tax, and I was pleasantly surprised to find that it was pretty tasty. At a quick glance, the prices are pretty reasonable, and the coffee was pretty strong.  Anyway,  after I briefly chatted with the worker, I found that they're planning on moving into the actual building whenever they get the green light from the city. Stinson's is planning to serve up alcohol as well, and they hope to have neighborhood hangouts here - a place for people to come out and enjoy whatever game is on (with drinks of course).  I don't think I can fairly review until they move in, so it's three stars from me (with likelihood for a higher rating). I look forward to the finished product, but for the time being, Stinson's is a quick and solid option for coffee. Check it out! ", neutral

Stinson’s ," 2/13/2014 15 check-ins I love Stinson's! I first went there when they were a trailer on the corner of 45th and Burnet. The barista and I were from the same region up in North Texas (and he'd even been a barista at my old coffee place in Amarillo), so that was pretty cool right off  the bat!   They just opened their bistro up in the newly remolded, once gas station, on the same property their trailer stood on. I could go on and on about how they renovated the gas station into the bistro, but it looks AND SMELLS amazing. It just smells like fresh wood everywhere, mixed with coffee-- its pretty much perfect. The textiles they chose, wood floors paired with brick work, even down to the sinks in the bathrooms,  it all looks so classy and amazing.     I've only had three drinks so far, chai latte (great), soy latte (great, strong), and I tried bourbon in coffee which was pretty interesting.. they said it was just one shot but I was feeling it.. ha ha! Their pumpkin muffins are great, the best muffins out of what they carry in my opinion-- and ask for it to be heated, makes it 100x better. There's a cute bar with a few beers on tap (I know Guinness is one of them), and lots of pretty liqour bottles on their dark wooden bar shelving :) I know they are still in the process of getting everything together, but I think they just expanded their menu a TON, will probably be carrying lots more food items.  On top of it all, great location.. don't hesitate to give them a try, stick around and enjoy your drink, and soak up all that yummy ""fresh wood"" scent :D ", pos 
Stinson’s ," 5/31/2014 This is probably my favorite coffee place in Austin. The drinks are always top notch and I feel like every drink they make is truly done with care. You can tell with the taste that it's quality. The guy that owns it I believe, who previously just had the trailer is a really nice guy and now with the brick and mortar location, which is beautiful, the baristas he hired have all been really great as well. My favorite drink is an iced latte, but I've also had their chai, teas, smoothies, the croissants, and it's all very good! I also appreciate the all day hours now too. Great place to stop in quick or hang out for awhile. ", pos

Stinson’s ," 6/22/2014 3 check-ins I've had some good chai lattes here, and I like that they offer a selection of baked goods from Russell's. This place doesn't have the same vibe as other coffee shops, however. Or really any vibe. I find myself feeling slightly confused when I sit down with my chai and a book. I know they're trying to be different by also being a bar/restaurant-ish place, but they started out as a small trailer just serving coffee and pastries and I had hoped that their new location would cater more to that. Overall, it's just not a place to sit down with your coffee and relax. The tables are definitely oriented more towards a restaurant than coffee shop. ", neutral 
Stinson’s ," 8/31/2015 I enjoy studying at coffee shops, but often find myself driving all over Austin in search of a free table.  I was very fortunate to have Stinson's open up down the street from my home.  I love the coffee, and my father (who has much higher standards) is in full agreement.  The food is great and full of variety.  The service is stellar and the employees are friendly.  I would 100% recommend this place. ", pos 
Stinson’s ," 1/30/2014 I'm a huge fan of Stinson's coffee. I have to say I've never tried any of the food, but I look forward to doing so when the brick and mortar location opens (only a few days!). I love the fact that I can stand outside and wait for my coffee on a nice day or bring my dog with me. The guys that work the trailer are great and always friendly. The coffee menu has a good amount of options from regular drip to a latte, americano, mocha and even a white mocha for those of us that want something a little sweeter.  The only bad thing about this place is the parking, which is basically non-existent. So if you want to stop for a quick brew in the AM it might be a little difficult to navigate. But I'm pretty used to that now in Austin so it's definitely not enough to deter me from this place.  This is definitely my new neighborhood spot and I can't WAIT until the brick and mortar location opens!  PS - there are rumors that they'll be opening a second location as well. That's where the trailer will go once the permanent location is open. ", pos

Perfect location for that after work happy hour, lunch or morning drop-in for a fresh cup of your favorite brew.  If those weren't enough reason for you to try Stinson's Bistro then there's another...   You can be one of the first people in Austin to ORDER AHEAD FROM YOUR PHONE.  That's right!  Download the PayPal app on your smartphone, find Stinson's Bistro in the app and place your order (and pay) before you arrive.  They won't have the red carpet rolled out, but you can skip the lines and feel like the true VIP we all know you are. ", pos 
Stinson’s ," 4/30/2014 As far as the coffee goes, I've tried many different ones: latte, chai, iced latte, latte with a flavor, regular coffee, etc. and I am just never that impressed.  But the prices are good. And the people are really nice! ", neutral 
Stinson’s ," 12/23/2014 1 check-in I always wondered what would go into the old filling station next to my sister's place in Rosedale, and this place didn't disappoint. Skip the lines at Starbucks and go here for great lattes, yummy cocktails and the BEST pumpkin muffin you're taste buds have ever been lucky enough to touch. I could go on and on, but don't take my word for it...just go! ", pos 
Stinson’s ," 5/13/2014 Cute little place I only just found out about through my $8 PayPal deal. The exterior looks like some abandoned gas station, but the interior is a shnazzy, elegant coffee shop.  Ended up getting a vanilla chai latte since I'm not big on caffeine + a tortilla española. I like how this place is open at 6:30am and stays open late, too.  Vanilla chai latte: a bit too sweet, esp. if you were to drink this after it's turned cold, but you can definitely taste that otherwise the spices are a good, soothing blend. EDIT: They topped off my chai with a bit more chai and milk to try to decrease the sweetness. No charge. How sweet!  Tortilla española: I've actually been to Spain and had this popular Spanish breakfast item...pretty much every day. However, that was 6 years back or so, and I don't remember how it tasted. Stinson's makes this dish plus its aioli in house. Nothing to write home about, but it was still pretty good.  Ambiance: This is a nice place. I like the French(?) music being played. The news was on (abc station) and they play movies through Netflix on another big screen. They were playing a black and white film. Unsure what it was, but it meshed well with the classic beauty feeling of this coffee shop. Both screens are situated at the sides, so they're not too distracting.  Temperature: THIS was awesome. I've gone to WAYYYY too many places to study and end up getting cold pretty quickly. This place was nice and cozy.  Service: Great, friendly server.  Other: They have a plastic punch card that also works for their other Stinson's places (Stinson's Deep Eddy). For every purchased 10 drinks or treats, you get 1 free. ", pos

Stinson’s ," 6/17/2014 Went for coffee early on a Sunday afternoon - there was only one other client when I walked in but the place filled up within an hour or so. Cute atmosphere, nice barista,  decent coffee, and I'm delighted that they offer almond milk - though I wish it were the unsweetened kind. Didn't try any food.  I often like to use my computer at coffee houses and I appreciated the strong wifi and good availability of outlets for plugging in. However, due to the large windows, there was a lot of glare that made it hard to see my screen - perhaps at another time of day or in the evening, it would be better.  I'm glad this place is in my neighborhood and offers another option to Pacha (too small) and Upper Crust (no wifi). ", pos

Stinson’s ," 3/7/2015 The first time I went was for breakfast.   It was a pleasant experience so I thought about patronizing the business one evening.  The ambiance was ideal - low key and soothing.  The second time however,  the music was overwhelming, making conversation impossible.  I find the trend of loud venues an unsettling pattern that is major turn off.

Stinson’s ," 6/20/2013 I love coffee but physically, I can't drink that much.  So, imagine my surprise when I heard myself ordering a medium brew from these peeps.  Six ounces is my normal limit., then the sweat breaks through  They mixed my cream and sugar for me (love that) and soon that cup o' hotness was mine.    I drank the whole thing (nearly).  It was very delicious coffee!  And while I wait for the sweating and jitteriness to wear off, I think to myself, ""Yes Ma'am, a fine cup of joe, indeed!""  BTW, you can text in your order ahead of time.  For those of you that think ordering in person takes up WAAAAAY too much time and terribly inefficient. ", pos 
Stinson’s ," 10/20/2014 Great coffee by day, and tap-beers or cocktails by evening:  what's not to love?  The quality of the coffee drinks I've had here have been excellent.  I really enjoy the roast which isn't so dark that it borders on burnt like some large coffee chains.  Enjoy the atmosphere and good WiFi.  There are some coffee houses where it's next to impossible to get a seat or decent WiFi throughput.  Thankfully Stinson's hasn't become one of those venues (yet?).  I don't go there for the food.  They really don't have a kitchen there, and there's plenty of nearby restaurants and cafes with better food.  I read some people have taken them to task for the service. I've never had to wait too long, but I've also frequently taken advantage of texting my coffee order which I *love* to do.  It's great to swing by there in the a.m. before work and have my coffee ready to go.  Now, I just wish they'd provide those little stirring-plug sticks like a certain international coffee chain does that greatly reduces spillage from the little hole in the lid.... ", pos 
Stinson’s ," 10/16/2014 Daisy grabbed a coffee late in the evening to go. Good espresso quality, had an awesome pumpkin muffin. Looking forward to going back to read or get dinner. Great blend of bar, restaurant, and coffee shop. My bearded bar tender turned make-shift barista was funny. Enjoyed chatting with him. Said he's more of a bar tender than a barista (I mean it was after 9pm so that's like their bar time mainly) so apologized if drink wasn't perfect but it was. ", pos 
Stinson’s ," 7/17/2013 11 check-ins Listed in Coffee Coffee Coffee ""Can't beat a great coffee trailer that has superb coffee! Soon to be a full blown coffee shop.""  I'm always looking for a good place to get coffee. Lo and behold this little wonder pops up out of no where. What used to be Cutler Automotive is now becoming Stinson's coffee shop! At first I thought it was a little odd considering the long-time business, Upper Crust, is across the street.  I've been going there for years, and they have phenomenal baked goods and coffee. However, that does not mean I don't have room in my repertoire of coffee shops. There's always room for more!     The great thing is you can text them your order at (512)-968-4970 so your drink is ready when you arrive. This makes that quick coffee fix even quicker. Although an IV filled with coffee would probably be the fastest solution for that morning drag. I love this place because it's around the corner from my office, so it's easy to stop by on my way to work. Don't forget about the orgasmic pumpkin spice muffin. See if they'll heat it because it's addicting. I'm definitely going to be craving these come fall. Now this place isn't perfect right now, they're in a trailer in front of the shop that they're trying to remodel in order to move in. They have been trying to accommodate people however they can though. There's picnic tables with a huge flat screen tv, free Wi-Fi, and some parking spaces on the side; a little awkward to get in and out though. Once the actual café opens, Alex said that they will be serving sandwiches too. There is definitely quite a bit of coffee competition in this area, so I wish Stinson's the best in a successful venture. Whether it's a plain cup of coffee, a fancy latte with a pretty design, an iced latte for the days where you can fry an egg on the sidewalk, or a delicious chai tea latte. They have it all and, in my opinion, are definitely worth checking out. Medium mocha latte and pumpkin spice muffin ", pos 
Stinson’s ," 1/2/2015 I love this place! As a senior at UT, I've frequented dozens of coffee shops around Austin and Stinson's honestly serves the best lattes I've had in town. Their espresso is rich but never bitter, and their steamed milk is always thick and smooth. They have plenty of outlets, great natural lighting, and their service is always attentive.

While trolling on Instagram, my sister and I found this place and decided well because we are sisters, we had to go get some coffee here. Hidden around a corner off Caesar Chavez, the little daisy sign that says Coffee and the graffiti wall is the perfect invite in. You walk into a quaint little room with a small coffee bar where you meet your barista. Small menu, which is perfect. I opted for an iced coffee and sister got a latte. We walked around and look at some art, clothing, shoes & jewelry while we waited on our drinks. I must admit, this is one of the BEST iced coffees I've ever had. While normally I want creamer or sugar, this one didn't need it. SERIOUSLY AMAZING! Not to mention the cute cups their drinks are served in!

It apparently is two sisters working alternate schedules, I had a fun convo about roasters with Saturday Katie (hope I got her name right), and she made me a hot black pour-over using my cup.

The coffeeshop is connected to a really cool bookstore and boutique you can browse in while drinking your coffee, and there is one or two tables to sit at, but don't come here with a large group of friends and expect to sit and chat or work for a long time.

I'd recommend parking in a nearby neighborhood and walking over to this vibrant yellow cafe.  The menu had decent amount of things on it, there were many other items, but I read pancakes were great here, so that is what we ended up ordering. We got the Pancake Special - half size with blueberry and pear filing, and over-medium eggs on the side.  These pancakes were delicious! Buttery, soft and had a nice browning to it. The fruits were a plus, sweet and delightful, along with the maple syrup which was not too sweet.  I'd come back for a quick bite of pancakes again, and maybe even a cup of coffee.

Pacha ," 10/6/2016 1 check-in Typical indie coffee shop, and I mean that in the best way.   Though they have a relatively small sitting area it would be a great place to study or read.    Their highlight is their pancakes, particularly their apple/bacon/scallion pancakes.   The dough itself is very fluffy and very slightly crispy at the edges (i.e., just as it should be).  I have to say the pears, scallions, and bacon marry together really well.    Was probably a top 10 pancake for me!    I'd definitely return. ", pos

Parking is available in the street if no parking spaces are available in the lot. Pacha is a little cozy restaurant - homey like with charm.  There are about 10 tables inside with additional 5 tables outside when the weather permits. Menu is decently extensive with breakfast and lunch options. We arrived when there was a couple in front of us, but the line can got worse after 11:30AM. That line was to the door, and the cashier inside yelled twice to keep the door shut.  There is a wait time for when you receive your food order - written next to the Coffee/Drinks board. It was 35 minutes when we arrived, but the wait time can be greater than 1 hour. Small kitchen, so they are most likely lacking in the number of cooks vs orders ratio.  Food: Beef Hash (3/5, 100% grass fed beef with grilled potatoes, leeks, carrots, celery, and turnip, served with wilted green with 2 eggs any style): I was not impressed by this - just okay. I ordered my eggs sunny up slightly easy, and those were made perfect! The serving is not filling in my opinion for the price I paid. It was kind of bland despite being seasoned, so I used some Habanero hot sauce that made it twice as better than before!  French Toast (4/5, Sourdough toast soaked in spiced egg butter with maple pecan espresso butter): Can be served solo, with 2 eggs, meat, or all. This was delicious! Light and fluffy! I loved the sourdough toast with the different take on the butter. It was not too sweet in my opinion - just the right amount. Apparently, you can switch the toast if you are not a fan of sourdough. The french toast alone is not fulfilling, so you should pay for the additional eggs and meat.  A few choices on the menu stood out but not being a big pancake person, I opted for the Beef Hash and French Toast. Personally, I'd try to order food items that are made fresh instead of things from the display. At Pacha, they endorse local made/grown products with 90% of the food prepared being organic.  Yes, I would come back to try the breakfast tacos and that Pear Bacon Pancake! Plan your visit though - parking, wait and food time, and seating.

Pacha ," 8/12/2016 3 check-ins I am in love with Breakfast at Pacha and so is everyone else. The space is fun and vibrant with color, and there are tables packed together inside.  There is nothing fancy here, just a converted house.  There are a couple of spots to sit outside at the front and back door.  On a cooler day, eating outside is lovely, as you can then escape the noisy banter inside.   On a Sunday there is a line to the door, and patience must be found as you wait 30-40 minutes after your order is placed.  You place your order at the cash register, and then receive a number to take with you to a table to wait. The food is then delivered to you. Tables are first come - first serve, so snag one if you are a party of two.  They now serve Breakfast at Pacha until 6pm, and after 11am you can select from the afternoon menu.  The place is packed on the weekend, and bubbly with noise of breakfast eating patrons.  Even though the place is small, the selection of drink and food options to choose from is vast.  Everything is locally sourced and organic.  They make everything themselves in house - even the delicious looking deep dish pies and quiches (you can custom order one for yourself if you ask 3 days in advance).    I love that they have a gluten free menu that includes French toast as an option (that is rare!).  The gluten free French toast is delicious, and the maple-pecan-espresso butter is out of this world.  I didn't even need syrup.  It was the perfect combination of slightly sweet meets savory.  The smoothies are creamy, thick, and very filling.    The pancakes can be made savory, or jam packed with fruit.  My husband loved the pancake batter, but didn't find the combination of bacon and pear very good.  Next time he will stick to the blue berry.  The pancake bite I had was delicious. The batter is sweet, moist, and fluffy.  I just wish they had a gluten free version.  The omelets are also fresh and tasty.  You can select how many eggs you want, and what ingredients you want inside.  It is served with a slice of bread (can substitute with a gluten free bread).    For drinks you can select from a menu of coffee, tea, beer, wine, organic cider, or MIMOSAS (my personal fave!).  The organic coffee they have here is superb.  They make a mean coffee drink.  The pacha latte mix that they have premade and mix up with their coffee is made from soy milk and not too sweet. I highly recommend it.  The mimosas are $4 and on the larger size.    The parking here is very limited. There are a few spots in the back.  But, I have always had to park in the neighborhood.

Pacha , 11/7/2016 Came here for a pre birthday brunch with some close friends. We each got something different and so I got to try a bit of everything. The pancakes are definitely some of the most delicious things that I have tried. I tried banana pear and cheese and bacon and they were so good. The French toast has  comes with a really tasty cinnamon butter and the coffee is so fresh. Might be a little small but since I have lived in Nola for a while I thought it was fairly sized. I went with a large group probably the largest there but it wasn't too noisy or too quiet and the staff was great Mimosas!! , pos 
Pacha ," 3/5/2016 1 check-in Pear, bacon, and green onion. Who knew this odd combo can be so tasty when mixed in a fluffy pancake?!  Friend and I came here for brunch. Neither of us were especially hungry, so we shared a full size pear, bacon, and green onion pancake with 2 eggs, over medium. If only we had known how good the pancake will turn out, we would've gotten our own  We ate it as was and skipped the syrup. A pancake that's delish without syrup? Not sure how American this is, but it was delish!  Why 4/5? The wait was ~30 min, and parking.

Food will be brought to you.  If you want something more, go back up to the counter and place another order.  At the end of your visit, please clear your table and place your dishes in the dish pan.  On my last visit I had the pear, bacon, green onion pancake with two eggs on the side.  So delicious!  Pancakes were served with syrup, which I didn't touch.

Pacha ," 3/20/2016 3 check-ins We came here on a Saturday morning for some breakfast and I was a little apprehensive due to what seemed like mixed reviews on yelp.  Based on the pictures people posted it was enough for me to give it a try.  We arrived around 10:30am and as people mentioned there isn't a lot of parking, but we were lucky enough to find a spot in the back immediately.  The line to order only had a few people in front of us which actually gave us time to look over the menu and nail down our order since this was our first time here.  We were noticing as we were about to order there weren't many tables and most people seated had not gotten their food yet which gave me a little anxiety.  We proceeded to order a banana pancake and a meaty pancake with a mocha latte with Mexican chocolate.  We stood and waited for a table and one became available within a few minutes which was nice.  We did wait about 45 minutes for the food, but we were for warned that it would take that long so we didn't mind.  The food itself was delicious and the majority of it is all local farms and organic. The coffee was also great and served in ginormous cups which makes the wait for the food more palatable so I would recommend a beverage with your meal. Here is what I would not recommend if thinking about coming here. - I don't know about coming with a large group as the biggest tables probably only seat 5-6 people. - kids unless they are prepared to sit still for quite awhile - coming with someone you don't plan to conversate with because there will be plenty of time for that. - if you are in a hurry although I will say at 11:30 when we were leaving it did appear to be emptying out so maybe later in the morning towards almost lunch time is the way to go. We will definitely be back though as we loved the food and coffee. Banana pancake Support our locals Meat pancake See all photos from Charles Y. for Pacha ", pos 
Pacha ," 8/15/2016 So, first the positives:  1. Gluten-free options, including bread. HUGE for me.  2. Also having decent eggs and vegetables to put into an omelet or something, vs. coffee shops that just have muffins and pastries. Yay for GF and protein!  3. I like the funky decor.  Now the not-so-positives:  1. Parking sucks (and can be dangerous with cars whizzing past on Burnet).  2. That funky decor (furniture specifically) can be not-so-funky for working too long (read: your bum might start hurting!)  3. The people waiting on you aren't the usual ""Austin friendly"". And while I don't always enjoy the idol chit chat, being rude is another story.  So that why 3 stars. For friendliness and a better-butt working environment (not to mention better lattes, my drink of choice), I'd go up/down the road a bit to Monkey Nest. Unless of course, you're looking for GF, protein-rich breakfast. :-) ", neutral 
Pacha ," 3/2/2016 1 check-in Old tiny house turned cozy cafe, with that being said there is limited parking and seating. Not a good idea to come in groups larger than 2. Drinks come out at a reasonable time but just a heads up that food ordered will take a while (30+ mins for french toast with 2 sausages and 2 eggs). The staff will acknowledge you when they are ready- No ""i'll be with you in a min"" just ignore, once they are ready then they will pay full attention and be nice. My food was fine, I enjoyed every single bite; I was in no rush today however this place would make the time sensitive pretty pissed. I don't dislike this place and would even come again for some drinks. I appreciate that they try to be local, healthy, organic however for the prices they charge and the time they take to serve food I expected more. French Toast, 2 Eggs and Sausage ", neutral

Pacha ," 8/30/2016 This is an Austin hipster place to eat for sure. The pros: quaint/intimate place to eat, fun brunch place, the staff was friendly/helpful, food was good quality and touted as organic The cons: parking is limited, it is small and is meant for small parties of 1-3, limited menu (has a more breakfast/brunch feel to it - not for dinner), when they run out of stuff (like quiche) they are out, not well suited for the handicapped (maneuvering or seating), food speed is slow Overall: it was an ok experience, we were able to park, our mother in the wheelchair was able to be accommodated (but we think we were lucky), the food was good, and the staff was friendly and helpful. We would consider going back if it was just one or two of us, and I would call ahead to see if they were out of any major items I might be interested in eating. ", neutral

Pacha ," 7/28/2015 1 check-in On a Tuesday morning we couldn't find parking (there are only 10 spots) so we ended up finding a space on 46th street and just walked over. We sat on the small shaded back porch that had two ceiling fans running which was nice and kept us cool despite the 90 degree heat. Next time we'll be sure to bring our dog to come hang out with us.  The staff is very friendly and easy going, which already puts them well ahead of other coffee shops in Austin. My boyfriend was able to have a video conference call, so I know the wifi works well also. This is a really hip spot with an eclectic fan base which makes for a fun environment to meet up with friends, not so much for studying or reading (unless with headphones).  I had the smoked wild salmon plate on a toasted seeded bagel with cream cheese and tomato-dill pico and it was seriously slap-yo-mama good. PHENOMENAL even. I couldn't help but make gleeful little moans as I took each bite- so much that my boyfriend rolled his eyes and asked if I needed some alone time, ha!

Pacha ," 6/1/2016 A year ago, I would've definitely given this place a 5 star. I hope the owner and staff read this message, so that I can give them a 5 star rating.  On a good day, food is good and coffee is hot. On a bad day, food is warm, the portions are smaller and the pachalatte is luke warm.

Pacha ," 1/11/2016 1 check-in I visited Austin for the weekend, and ended up trying out a few brunch spots, but Pacha was the winner in my eyes. Some of the best pancakes I've ever had, and I've had a lot of good pancakes. So good, in fact, that I tried to duplicate the apple and cranberry at combo at home the next day (with some success...go me!). This might sound crazy, but I loved the lighting and cute tables and tablecloths. Prime food photo backdrops. My friend and I each got a delicious latte while we waited for our food on a busy Sunday afternoon. Two egg white omelets with veggies and a pear and cranberry pancake for me, and an apple and cranberry pancake for her.  Amazing. Seriously. I savored every bite. I want more.  The restaurant is tiny and there isn't a lot of parking. Because of the size, it can take some time to get your food, so if you're starving, grab a cup of coffee. It's good coffee. Very good coffee. Addictively good coffee.  I also bought two cookies to take home with me because I couldn't resist. Such a cute spot for a fresh, healthy and delicious brunch. I wish I could take them back to Denver with me! Pacha latte and cookies! Excellent brunch! Pancake with apples and cranberries, and egg white omelets with veggies. Everything was amazing. ", pos 
Pacha ," 12/12/2015 Wonderful brunch place worth the parking hassle! I consider myself an anti-pancake person, but I think I can make exception for Pacha.  I had the pear, bacon, and scallion pancake and thought it was outstanding. On the menu it might seem a little nondescript (the description just says something about a savory-sweet taste), but I think that is underselling it by a lot - it reminded me of a bit of Korean pajeon, but perhaps less heavy (not a bad thing). I satiated my anti-pancake tendencies by adding two eggs and Canadian bacon to the side, which did the trick.  I took a bite out of my friend's Beef Hash and thought it was tasty, but maybe not as ""special"" as the pancakes. I'm inclined to recommend the pancakes for first-timers, but that's out of a sample size of two dishes tried.  As an added bonus there are many quaint houses in the neighborhood behind Pacha that you will inevitably park in. Seriously, don't bother trying to get a spot at Pacha - there's not many and the killer incline will murder smaller cars.  Overall there don't seem to be much seating, but we didn't have to wait during peak hours on Saturday morning. This was a good experience and I look forward to coming back! ", pos

They seem to have a deep care for the earth and what they purchase for you to consume. They are still managing the wait times most likely not because the place is to small as the menu is just to big.

The place is small with a handful of small tables.  The menu lists out the local farms and sign states they are 90% organic.  The menu sounds very good and the portion are big.  I ordered a half portion of blueberry pancake and salmon lox omelet.    The wait took a total of one hour but it was worth the wait.  They offer free wifi and had no problems just sitting and sipping on coffee.    Pancakes-- perfect! Omelet was delicious and fluffy.

Pacha ," 9/20/2015 Updated review 1 check-in We went to Pacha on a Sunday about 1:45. It was crowded, apparently a popular brunch spot. It was very loud, partly from the diners but the music was also playing pretty loud. Normally I wouldn't mind but I was with someone who has trouble hearing so it was a little too loud. Pacha is very casual - order at the counter, find a table. Even though it was crowded, we find a table right away.  I had been wanting to try the beef hash. The menu says the hash is slow-simmered beef with potatoes, leeks, carrots, celery and turnip, served on wilted spinach and topped with two eggs. As you could guess from the description, this is not your traditional corned beef hash with cabbage and potatoes. It tasted good, though I would have like it to be warmer. I noted that it was kind of spicy. The menu doesn't  mention anything about spiciness. I asked the woman behind the counter. She said the beef is simmered with some jalapeños or serranos. I liked it but I think they should indicate this on the menu as some people might not want the spice. I also had breakfast potatoes. They were good, but not crispy at all and could have been warmer, as well.  The other people with me had standard breakfast fare - an omelette with Swiss cheese and mushrooms and American breakfast with eggs, bacon and potatoes. They said both were good. We also had coffee, which was good and strong. You have to pay $1.00 for refills.  The total price was about $40, not bad for pretty good food.  All in all, we enjoyed our brunch as Pacha.

Pacha ," 3/22/2015 2 check-ins Hi. I got food here. It was good.  My foods:  - French toast plate with eggs: French toast wasn't overpowered with powdered sugar so I can actually taste the bread.  - beef specialty pancake: I got the half size and I regretted it on my first bite because it was so unexpectedly good! Next time I'll get a full size. At first, the combination of the pancake didn't sound appealing but that pancake slapped me in the face.  - blueberry muffin: I'm not usually a fan of sweets but I finished my meal off with this well balanced muffin. Size, moistness(?) and sweetness was great.  Pros: - the staff here are friendly and very welcoming. Yay Austin TX. - surprisingly they have a good selection of food including baked goods and gluten free items for those that do that stuff.  Cons: - parking is a turn off, I came here once and just left since I couldn't park - expensive but it's probably because they use organic ingredients. So that we don't die.

Pacha ," 7/25/2015 3 check-ins Such a cute house sitting on Burnet. On a Saturday morning right at 8am there was a small line and the wait for food wasn't as bad as I had read about. When we left it still wasn't too bad so maybe it gets more crowded towards noon. The parking in the back is definitely limited and I probably wouldn't have stayed if I couldn't find a spot. I guess it helps with crowd control?  After reading a bunch of reviews I had to try the pear bacon scallion pancake, and it was DELICIOUS! I would highly recommend. My boyfriend got the french toast with eggs and meat (bacon) which was also pretty good, not smothered in powered sugar like other places. Sadly, the pacha latte wasn't as great as I had hoped but probably because I like my coffees pretty sweet. Also, when I asked for it with soy the waiter said that it always comes with soy so that's pretty cool. I think I'll have to try it iced next time.

Pacha ," 3/4/2015 1 check-in Listed in breakfast!, comfy, cozy, & chill Pacha is this little cabin-looking café off of Burnet that showcases hand-painted tables, mismatched chairs, and quaint eccentricity all around.  Oh, and a pretty bomb pear-bacon-scallion pancake. It's dense and fluffy. The scallions add a mild, onion-y taste that goes surprisingly well with the tanginess of the pear, the saltiness of the bacon, and the sweetness of the syrup. It sounds like there's a lot going on, but Pacha's unique pancake pushes your tastebuds without going too overboard.  The beef hash was flavorful and well-seasoned, though my friend and I agreed that it wasn't anything too special. We also ordered the beef empanada: the crust was golden, flaky, and buttery, but the seasoned meat inside was sort of dry. I was slightly disappointed in it.  As delicious as the pear, bacon, and scallion pancake was (it really, really was), I can't bring myself to give Pacha that fourth star. The other food was decent at best, and the price is a little steep - for just a single, 7-inch pancake (the full size), I paid $8.40. The beef hash was $10+, and the underwhelming empanada was $3+.  I'm sorry Pacha! That pancake though. beef hash, pear-bacon-scallion pancake, & beef empanada ", neutral 
Pacha ," 2/20/2015 Came here for brunch with some friends and it was overall pretty delicious.  The restaurant is quite small and so is the parking lot, so it took us a while for us to find parking. Pacha offers a wide variety of menu options including breakfast, brunch, and afternoon or dinner meals.  Our little group ordered their famous pear/bacon/scallion pancake, sourdough French toast, and the beefy melt. The pancake was absolutely delectable, the mix of flavors is just right and the combination is unique. The French toast was mediocre and nothing special. I thoroughly enjoyed the beefy melt as well, but noted it felt a little too heavy and greasy for me.

Pacha ," 6/27/2015 1 check-in An Austin ""must try"" so of course, we tried it.  Very organic, laid back and no nonsense breakfast joint. The vibe is very ""Austin"" or if you're from San Diego it's very Ocean Beach. Or if you're from Colorado, it's very Boulder.  Everything is made fresh and you can taste it. The eggs, potatoes, pancakes, and even coffee are tasty, nothing fancy, just straight up home cooking goodness.  The prices are reasonable too $8.35 for 2 eggs + potatoes + sausage or bacon. $5.25 for their famous pancakes. My hubby is still talking about his apple/pear pancakes, and I thoroughly enjoyed the spicy sausage.  We went mid-week during the summer so there wasn't a wait and plenty of seating. Although as we were leaving most of the tables were occupied by people sipping coffee on their computers, so a table shortage was in the future.  We'd both recomend this place for sure. ", pos 
Pacha ," 7/26/2016 A nice place and the brewed coffee was inexpensive and tasted good. Staff was friendly and I am glad we finally got to try here. I inferred that it is busy here on weekends, so I'm glad we came during the week around 1:30p. Wouldn't mind returning. ", pos 
Pacha ," 4/27/2016 Reading some of the other reviews, it sounds like I was pretty fortunate with my timing. There was no line when I showed up. I did have to wait a little while for my food, but it seems like they're doing the best they can with what they have.  I had coconut pancakes with bacon and eggs. I order the eggs over medium and one of them showed up over hard. That's about where it stops when it comes to my complaints. The coconut pancakes were amazing and the bacon was cooked just the way I like it (and I didn't even have to tell them how I like it). The consistency of the pancakes was nice and soft, not like a normal place where you're basically gambling on whether or not they'll be overcooked. I also had a cappuccino and that was tasty.  The ambiance was pretty relaxed, with neat artwork on the walls and tables. People were working on their laptops, so there wasn't a ton of loud chatter around me. There was some chill music playing in the background at just the right volume. There's also an outdoor seating area that looks like it'd fun to hang out at. They have board games near the kitchen so they don't seem too opposed to folks lounging around.  The parking isn't great, but I'm kind of use to parking in neighborhoods and walking to get good food. I would come back here again! ", pos 
Pacha ," 8/10/2016 Long waits, but you won't be disappointed. Make sure you do not go there already ""hangry"" because you will probably hurt someone. Bring a magazine, kick back and relax, enjoy the people watching and most of all THE AMAZING PANCAKES! :) ", pos

Pacha , 10/27/2015 Pacha was on point on a Saturday morning before heading to ACL. I had the Pear Bacon Pancake with chives. I was a little skeptical with all the different ingredients in this pancake but I am so glad I tried it. The mixture of sweet and salty is a great blend. I would recommend trying this pancake out to any pancake lover! The service was a bit slow but they were pretty well organized. The staff was extremely friendly as well and made the morning very pleasant! Doesn't break the bank either! , pos 
Pacha ," 8/16/2015 A quirky Austin-y vibed brunch spot.  We came at about 11am, so it was very crowded.  We sat on the porch in the back with a stack of trash/leftover food that had yet to be thrown away right next to us.  Unfortunate setting, as we were swatting away flies pretty constantly.  However, overall the feeling of the place was cute and organic.  We got the Salmon Plate and the Pear Bacon Pancakes.  Both were pretty ""meh"".  The salmon came with a bit of cream cheese, a bit of pico, and a choice of everything or sea salt bagels.  The salmon itself was okay, but nothing special.  The quantity was not high either.  The taste was good, but ehh, not even as good as Einstein Bagel's Nova Lox.  The Pear Bacon Pancake was a good balance of sweet and savory, but it was overwhelmed by the battery taste.  The scallions were strong with the overall pancake and hijacked some of the taste from the pear and bacon.  We also got a Berry Bliss Smoothie - pretty organic and fresh, but a bit overpriced ($7.50 for a regular sized cup...)  Overall - meh.  Good atmosphere, friendly staff, okay food.  Don't regret trying it, but probably won't return. Pear Bacon Pancake with 2 eggs on the side Salmon Plate Berry Blitz Smoothie ", neutral 
Pacha ," 1/8/2016 1 check-in Thanks to Yelp, I found this little gem. Initially, customer service was not impressive. We got in and did not know whether to order ourselves or someone would be by and give us the menu and take our orders. After a few minutes of waiting I decided to go to the counter and found out we have to put In our orders. Everything else was fantastic. The coffee was great probably one of the best I've ever had. We ordered French toast and the American breakfast and we were satisfied and full. One of the staff came by and gladly answered our questions and was very accommodating. I would be back and try the other items on their menu for sure. Overall, we were very happy The American breakfast. The sausage link was good! The French toast ", pos 
Pacha ," 3/12/2016 They use fresh and local ingredients and it shows.  Meats, eggs, cheese -- all excellent.  Food is done right.  The coffee drinks set this place apart as they are all prepared to perfection.  Everyone is friendly from the staff to the clientele -- people are just happy to be here.  Why 4 stars instead of 5?  The biggest thing for me is that the line ordering at the counter moves slowly.  They have so many food and coffee options (which is great from a meal perspective) and an ordering system that doesn't seem to be sufficient that it slows down the process.  Not a super huge deal as long as you know what you are getting into -- it's not a place where you can grab a quick bite. ", pos 
Pacha ," 3/28/2015 Coolest coffee place in LoBurn hands down.  (Actually coolest restaurant in LoBurn hands down).  Best decorated coffee place on the north side hands down.  Not all the custom beverages are wonderful  but the Pacha latte and anything with Mexican chocolate is quite fine.  The basic coffee and espresso are quite fine.  Food excellent if it is cooked to order.  Food awful if semi-pre-made. Avoid empanadas and items in the display case.  There are not many places to sit - and the place is super super crowded.  So even though it is a wonderful wonderful place to sit and work all day and hang out all day - somebody someplace is going to want your table unless it is a rainy Wednesday.  Parking is impossible.  Ordering food takes             f    o     r     e     v     e    r.  The menu is incomplete. The boards are incomplete. The person taking your order is friendly, but chatty, and doing other things at the same time and the ordering system is cumbersome.  So lines   n  e  v  e  r    m  o  v  e  .  Then because it is a small kitchen, it just takes a long long time for your food to come.  But it is a beautiful room full of sunshine and Latin American art and happiness ...  so as long as you have the whole day in front of you and the sun is shining who cares.  One of my favorite coffee places in Austin - better for mellow conversations with friends and a yummy slow breakfast -  than barging in with deadlines on your mind and forty urgent work-related things to do on your computer.  However, if this is your day to write poetry on your computer -  Pacha's is a great choice. ", pos

Pacha ," 6/20/2016 I'm between 4 and 3 stars, but giving it 3 ultimately because if I think about whether I would drive there if in town again, probably not.  I had the pear, bacon pancake, which was pretty good - I paired it with a side of grass-fed spicy ground beef, so the two were pretty darn good. We also ordered french toast and omelette. Everybody was overall happy. The coffee, cafe con leche, was ok, needs to be stronger. Overall, we were very pleased with our meal and very happy to have dining options that offer organic, grass-fed foods. The meals came out fast and I found the place to be a cute small gem... that would be great if addresses a few things:  What they can work on - greeting with a smile on arrival would be nice, and maybe offer direction... ""please have a sit"" or ""when you're ready, we'll take your order."" We sat near the area where dishes are dropped, and the trash can in that area didn't have a lid or cover, and combined with the flies inside the cafe, there was a slight odor. ", neutral 
Pacha ," 5/23/2016 I have never eaten a better pancake.  I have also never waited as long for a pancake (only because the place is highly popular and busy).  The coffee is delicious.  The staff is very kind and helpful.  The atmosphere is charming.  It is pricy, but with this price you will be getting Quality.  Today I discovered that if you take home the pancake bacon and egg and eat it on the next day, having just chucked it in the fridge for 36 hours, you will still be consuming a delicious leftovers snack.

The place was beautifully decorated with artwork on every surface and the wifi information was displayed in multiple parts of the cafe. The service was wonderful, we even got some help finding our way back to our hotel. Definitely try Pacha.

Pacha ," 1/13/2016 I love brunch, so naturally I had to try Pacha! It was my first time, and a friend and I split the pear pancake and the classic american breakfast plate. First of all, the restaurant itself is very cute and eccentric, very typical of a small Austin spot. There's also free wifi, which is a definite plus for a college student such as myself. I can definitely see myself working or studying there as the vibe is really chill and the staff is super nice and relatable! It was the middle of the day on a weekday, so limited seating may sometimes be a problem, but it wasn't for us. Waiting for the food didn't take long either.  Now to the real details. The pear pancake was incredible! It was huge and amazingly fluffy and literally melted in my mouth, and the pear addition to the flavor was so delicious. I'd never had anything like it, even compared to Kerbey Lane, though I've never tried pancakes at Magnolia Cafe. I love that they use fresh, organic ingredients at Pacha! It makes me feel a little less guilty about loving breakfast food. The sausage, eggs, and potatoes were cooked so nicely and the platter was really filling, so I think it's worth the money.  Didn't try the coffee there today, but I will definitely be back soon to do so! Cannot wait to come back and try all the different pancake flavors and probably the omelettes too. Would surely recommend this to anyone looking for a moderately priced brunch place that is super yummy. ", pos

Family that got here right before us ordered some granola, pancakes and eggs and their poor boy did not seem happy waiting. These are breakfast foods, they shouldn't take that long to make!

Pacha ," 2/22/2015 6 check-ins A great local spot to meet a friend for brunch. Seating space is limited (it's a small, bright yellow house) but I always manage to find a spot. Maybe I'm just lucky like that.  My favorite thing to order is an egg scramble. You can customize a scramble with dozens of meat, cheese, and veggie options. (You can do the same with a breakfast taco.) I usually order mine with goat cheese, spinach, and onion- delicious!  Staff has always been very friendly, even in the midst of a rush. They pride themselves on carrying many organic and local ingredients. Many vegan and gluten-free options as well. Their quiches are always very satisfying. I hear their stuffed pancakes are to die for- they are next on my list to try.  Update: have tried both the apple cinnamon and the blueberry pancakes, and they are in fact to die for! I've been ordering a half size pancake with one breakfast taco. A little sweet and a little savory.  My main issue (that becomes seemingly unimportant in the midst of their sheer awesomeness)- parking can be difficult. They have a teeny lot in the back that maybe holds five cars. I usually have to park a couple blocks away, which is no problem if the weather is good. Front of café (isn't it adorable?) ", pos

Pacha , 7/14/2015 First I want to start with the positive.... great food. Local and organic. The blueberry pancakes were delicious. French toast was really good. This place is a good local spot to have brunch/ lunch or coffee. Ok the not so positive.... The wait was awful. It took 20 mins standing in line order our food. Then it was an additional 40 mins to get our food. We went on a Sunday at 11:00.... So maybe it was our fault for going in the prime time for brunch. The menu was a bit confusing.... They have a chalk menu I guess that had features or seasonal items. The actual menu was no where in sight. When I started in line I was by the door. There was no access to a menu until I got to the register to order. Maybe that's why there was such a wait because people didn't know what to order. The parking.... Where do people park? There is seriously like ten spots. The cleanliness there was kinda gross.... dust on the ceiling and on the tops of machines. The painted table tops where sticky (was it the paint or the syrup I dunno) The last thing that stop this from having five stars there was no children's menu. I get it not every place is a family place. After all who wants to give their small children coffee but something small like a sandwich or smaller pancake would be fine. My lesson learn is when I do go back don't go in the prime brunch time on the weekend with kids. French toast with regular bacon. , neutral 
Pacha ," 7/9/2015 Pacha is great! I love that the coffee is fairtrade, and most of the food is organic/local.  My favorites are the iced Pacha Latte (coffee frappe, boosted with banana so it's a good breakfast on the go) and the daily quiche.  The baristas are always friendly and joking around. Can get pretty packed on the weekend, but its a great work/homework spot during the week, with solid wifi. ", pos

I ordered the pear & bacon pancake with a scrambled egg. The food took a while to come out but that's because they are making it fresh with real ingredients. The egg hit the spot. The kind of egg you'd get from a home cooked meal. Then there's the pancake. Holy moly I could go on forever about how good this pancake was.

I am a nightowl, so instead of suffering trying to get up at 3am, I just didn't go to bed. Since I had a couple of hours before I had to be at the airport and this place is 24hrs, I stopped in.  I had no idea what to expect, but this place is a bare-minimum type of joint when it comes to coffee house offerings. I settled for a red-eye and a biscotti as one of the few options of things to munch on. The biscotti tasted old. The coffee was ok, but nothing to rave about. The prices are not cheap, but they aren't pretentious either.  I take it by the abundance of tables this place is mostly for the wifi-seeking remotely working all night study/paper writing crowd. At just before 3am there weren't many people there, but more than I expected.  I found a comfy looking chair, plopped down, and partook of their wifi and killed my time.

I cannot give an opinion on the venue because I stopped by during the daytime, but for other rooms, it definitely is perfect for anyone who needs to get some work done during the day or just relax.

"Strange Brew, Austin Coffee "," 4/15/2015 1 check-in For a 24 hours study lounge, I really like Strange Brew. A lot. I'm not even sure if I would say I prefer their coffee, but compared to Epoch and Bennu, the place is way less crowded and a really nice drive to and from campus. Meaning, when you want to leave, you really have to make the effort of wanting to leave (which then, I hope, should propel you to continue with your studies).  Upon entering Strange Brew, to your left is a live music lounge for those chill nights. My nights are never chill, and I have yet to actually visit for the music alone--but hey, at least you get the option. The music is loud when you order, and I was afraid it would be loud when I studied but once you enter the study area, the music dissipates into background noise. Nice.  I like Strange Brew because I NEVER have to worry about parking, and I have yet to come and never find a seat--which is, honestly, the worst things about Bennu and Epoch. So Strange Brew is a little far from UT campus (10-15 minutes?), but it's worth the drive (to me).  The study area is big with lots of open space. Tons of tables. Tons of seats. And, people are usually gone by 12/1 AM, giving even plenty more seats/tables to choose from. A little on the dim side, but there's an even quieter and brighter silent study room with a door to shut off the world!  Their espresso/coffee is hot. Like, scalding hot. It takes a while for it to cool down. Their Strange Brew was really good--I quite enjoyed it. It kind of reminded me of Epoch/La Tazza Fresca's vanilla latte but WAY better, less sweet, and creamier. I also previously tried their iced vanilla latte, and I feel like it could have been good... with more espresso, less milk, and less ice. So maybe I'll ask them to switch some stuff around next time, lol.  Only thing I really don't like is that there's only one cashier, so it sometimes takes a while to even order your drink, especially bc of the fact that they brew/create your drink right then and there before they charge you (aka, holding up the line even more). It's alright though because the baristas are just so friendly!  Also, their wi-fi is a little jank. It takes a while for it to get working, and once it starts, it's a little laggy and goes in and out. But once it starts up, it stays pretty consistent--although, this could also be because people have disappeared by 2 AM and less people means better wi-fi. Who knows.  All in all--for a study lounge, I would say Strange Brew has been my favorite so far. Thumbs up, Strange Brew. ", pos

"Strange Brew, Austin Coffee "," 3/5/2016 This coffee shop is so relaxing and vibrant. I've come here countless times to get work done, meet up with friends, clients, and just to get some great tasting products! I love their coffee, teas, and treats.  They also have a room devoted to live bands and solo artists which is always fun to check out! They feature local artists paintings/art on the walls which makes it feel very local.

I'll admit that the lounge/coffee shop matchup is interesting, and the sound definitely permeates through the coffee shop, BUT I'm very impressed at how quiet they're able to keep the study room.  Like any coffee shop, the need for outlets and better wifi is there, but you really can't beat the place that's open 24 hours.  Never ventured to the music side, but perhaps I will someday!

We had a person in our group who needed to sit down due to some recent medical problems. The venue all but refused to accommodate this person's request for a chair and the encounter humiliated him to the point that my friend cried.

"Strange Brew, Austin Coffee "," 6/4/2016 1 check-in Honestly can't say anything bad about this place. It's different and friendly, I like that. It's our second time here and this time we enjoyed the music lounge. While waiting in line and deciding what to get for a drink, a local customer suggested the aristocrat. It's a frozen coffee blend that was the best that has ever graced my taste buds. I loved it! It's $10 for entry to see the local bands and that's for all night, come and go as you please. It's awesome. I like the atmosphere, I like the dark lighting and the intimate setting near the stage. I will admit this will probably only swing with some crowds, not all but my husband, cousin and I(ranging from early to late 20's) quite enjoyed it. If you like local music, or music in general check it out. This is a part of Austin I wish we had back home. ", pos 
"Strange Brew, Austin Coffee "," 4/17/2014 2 check-ins Simplicity at it's finest.  A no fuss, bare bones hang out space  with quality coffee, food, and drinks.  I was looking for a space to work virtually for several hours while waiting for my dog to be groomed, and dreaded having to just go to a Starbucks.  I was overjoyed to find Strange Brew.  It reminded me of all the awesome study spaces I used to haunt that got bought out and torn down by land developers in Seattle near the Univ. of WA.  This place even had a section for live music in the evenings.    I loved how everything here was just simple. It looks like they have slowly expanded as space has come available in the strip mall, connecting one empty retail spot to the next.  It's quite large once you get inside, and it's nice because each former retail space has a bathroom.  The final room on the end is a quiet study room with no music and lots of work stations near plug ins.  I like the local artists they highlight for sale on the walls.  They do have a modest outdoor space in the back that is dog friendly, and has limited sun shade.    You cannot eat or drink anything from outside.  So it's good they have a small variety of items to choose from.  They have a light menu of sandwiches and items to order, that they will make and call out your number.  There is a shelf with some prepackaged snacks -some are gluten friendly.  Also, there is a cold case with various drinks and beers, and a small selection of wine.  For a sweeter taste they have some pastries near the cashier.  Don't miss the Misty Morning Bakery Vegan/Gluten free cookies pre-wrapped in the basket by the pastries- the oatmeal raisin was one of the BEST I have had in awhile.  So what about the Brew?  I have saved the best for last.  The majority of morning patrons were lined up to get the drip coffee here.  I didn't get a chance to try that.  I instead tested the espresso.  Which was strong, and all things great about good espresso.  I loved the large selection of milk alternatives to choose from.  The hibiscus tea was refreshingly- not sweet.  Plus, the mixed iced coffee I took away when I left was the icing on the cake.  Yes, the Wi-Fi was free with purchase of food or beverage.  Just ask the cashier and a code is printed for you.  It was strong and steady.  You just need to request a new one after four hours.  The staff was incredibly friendly.  I will definitely be back the next time my pups needs a cut.

There's a study room if you need quiet but much more fun to do your coffee sipping/people watching/eavesdropping/pretending to work in the main rooms where the action is.

"Strange Brew, Austin Coffee "," 2/19/2015 1 check-in I love this place. I've been coming for 3 years, since I moved into the neighborhood. It's 24 hours and the double strangebrew with white chocolate is dreamy. The guys behind the counter always remember me and my modifications. I love that it's always a familiar face. I've watched them expand over and over. It's cool to see them grow. The Internet was my only complaint about this place but the situation has been fixed and now my phone automatically connects to the wifi when I walk in. They seem to have heard and understood people's frustration with the system and will never do that again. I think they should focus on developing the backyard more. It's a great space but needs some love and thought. Some plants would help, more seating or something decorative and welcoming. These are just ideas though. Strangebrew is my favorite coffee shop in town. Lots of seating and tables ", pos 
"Strange Brew, Austin Coffee "," 2/1/2016 1 check-in You know, I really wanted to love this place as I walked in with my boyfriend and a friend of ours. The positives about this coffee shop, is that they were pretty nice, explained what kind of beer they had to my boyfriend and helped him find the right one that he wanted, their sandwiches were delicious, and the place is really big so you can always find somewhere to sit. They also have a really nice room for live music. What I didn't like about this coffee shop was that when we checked in and received our 10% off discount, they told us that they don't take it anymore so we didn't get to use it. Also we arrived about an hour and a half early for open mic. We asked what time we were supposed to sign up and they just kept telling us to go into the music room at 9:30. When 930 rolled around, we went into the lounge area where the music is and there were already a line of about 30+ people. So, if you want to do open mic there you need to get there about an hour early and wait in line as soon as you get there and wait for the lady who takes the sign-ups to arrive. We were in able to do open mic, so we stayed to watch if you acts. You can tell that there was a bunch of people who go there every week and really great friends, they're open mic is more than older scene. ", neutral

"Strange Brew, Austin Coffee "," 9/11/2014 10 check-ins Listed in Southside - ATX I can not believe it has taken this long to finally stop in at Strange Brew.  I have been curious about it many times.  It is open 24 hours and every time I drive by, at all hours of the day, it looks like there are always people there.  I guess I did not stop in until recently because I am not a fan of coffee - at all.  I never drink it.  I do not like coffee flavored anything!  I am however a new fan of Strange Brew.    My fiance came home one day and told me he stopped in and ordered the peanut butter mocha frozen drink and it was one of the best things on earth for him.  He said he wanted to take me in to check it out.  Within the next couple of days we did just that.  I ordered the white chocolate frozen drink - it was surprisingly very tasty and refreshing!  I thought it was a good alternative for when I may be craving ice cream.  The barista was friendly and able to carry on a conversation as he made our drinks.  I also noticed the delicious looking cinnamon rolls sitting out.  I almost got one, but resisted.  On my second visit I ordered the chai frozen drink and it was just as delicious as the white chocolate.  I had decided ahead of time if they had the cinnamon rolls out I would get one, but they did not.  Oh well next time - I am sure I will be back!    The atmosphere here is pretty chill each time I have stepped in.  Looks like there is plenty of seating and free wifi.  There is also some seating outside as well.  Strange Brew has bought out many of the shops and continued to expand over the time they have been there and they have have the Strange Brew lounge side.  I have not checked this out yet, but will at some point I am sure.  I heard they also bought the Bakehouse building and am looking forward to what they will do with that.  I am glad I finally discovered this little gem in my neighborhood and I am excited to try some other fancy drinks and pastries (non coffee drinks of course). ", pos

"Strange Brew, Austin Coffee "," 3/8/2016 Review is a split between 5 stars for the laid back, unpretentious vibe and 1 star for the almost undrinkable coffee which is no frills (espresso drinks are automated machine poured, water is from tap, roaster not the greatest in my opinion: third coast.) There is a reason there are no hipsters here: coffee sucks. But put a bunch of milk and sugar in it and place is nice to hang out in when you want that ""old austin"" (pre 2012) vibe.

Lastly it's got a wicked cool live music section that's closed off so as not to disturb the study environment.  It's got it all!  Good IPA beers and for the vegans in the city: they've got a large selection of milk alternatives. Coconut milk, rice milk, hemp milk as well as the classic soy and almond.

"Strange Brew, Austin Coffee "," 5/3/2015 Okay, so the Strange Brew coffee concoction itself is what I like to come here for.  It's fatty mcfatterson, but OH SO GOOD.  Honestly, I have never had the desire to drink anything else here because it's that good.  Although I don't frequent this area much, I do like stopping by here once in a while.  Jamey is an awesome coffee aficionado, and everyone else also really knows what they're doing.  It's very chill, and to all the haters who don't like the decor, most everyone who goes there has their face planted in a book, so it really doesn't matter all that much.  It's nice that they have a study room dedicated to the intense crammer, and they have a back patio area that's nice. If the decor is not good enough for you inside, you can sit on the patio closer to the evening and watch the fireflies light up here and there.  I was so mesmerized by the fireflies that I kind of stopped listening to my friend's conversation with me and she basically had to repeat everything before I could respond properly.  I blame it on ADHD.  Doesn't everyone these days? ", pos 
"Strange Brew, Austin Coffee "," 10/15/2015 I've been here a few times, both for coffee and for shows. The music venue is great. When you're seated, it feels like you're in a downtown music venue. Very well done, great acoustics. What I'm not a big fan of is the other side, the coffee shop. For being such a huge area, it seems that the seating arrangements are lack and kind of odd. It just never seems put together - to me it looks like they drove around some neighborhoods, grabbed whatever seating and tables they could find on the side of the road, and threw them in the shop for a quick open. They could put a lot more chairs down to accommodate more people, which would help make it feel less open and sterile. For me, I like a warm, inviting coffee shop to hang out in, do some reading, whatever. If I want cold, I'll go to a fast food joint and sit in a booth. I don't think it would take much to make this place look and feel really stellar, but I don't know if they ever will. Because of this, it's never my first choice for coffee even though it's close by to my house. Sorry, I'm a sucker for a  relaxed, warm, comfortable atmosphere. ", neutral 
"Strange Brew, Austin Coffee "," 6/22/2015 Tried them a few times at different times. Shocked how poorly trained the baristas are. Watched a baristas use an old already pulled shot for my drink. Asked to not have it as hot as last time, got it again at 200° and burnt milk. Might be a good place if baristas were trained well, had standards, listened, & cared. Prices are probably the highest of all coffee places in Austin. Wanted to love this place since it's so close. ", neutral

"Strange Brew, Austin Coffee "," 3/21/2015 1 check-in I come here often to enjoy a cup of black coffee and there 'Italian"" sandwich....usually because it's quiet and they provide free wifi on the weekends, which I've found some other coffee joints refuse to do(radio cough cough). Today started out quiet, but I've discovered there is apparently a music venue right next door and they have live music!! As I'm listening through my headphones it sounds a little mellow, but there's definitely a drum set. Prices are reasonable here and that Italian sandwich is always delicious. Update : the live music is part of strange brew! ", pos 
"Strange Brew, Austin Coffee "," 7/20/2015 24-hour laid-back South Austin coffee shop with live music. More parking and room inside and outside than Epoch on North Lopp with a similar vibe, though the clientele skews older, and the parking lot fills up when they have a popular act on the Lounge Side, so expect to park next door at Bake House on weekend nights. The Lounge Side features live music and usually charges a cover, but the coffee shop side includes 2 seating areas to chat with friends, play games and do work with plugs along the walls, and a quiet study room. There is free wifi, but it's not the most reliable. They sell coffee, espresso drinks, Italian soda, bottled juices, beer & wine until midnight, and food includes paninis, premodern salad or quiche, pie by the slice and pastries & bagels. The staff is excellent but there is only one register to order so the line can get long. We love to come to work on our laptops outside in the back, which features picnic tables with umbrellas and a canopy and a large fan, but unfortunately they're down to only 2 available outlets so it can get pretty ""crowded"" with only a few people who need to plug in their devices. The other downside is the outlets are right behind the Lounge Side, so when people step out for a smoke break from the Live Music they fill up the work space. Also the wifi is pretty sporadic, so you have to be prepared for it to be unreliable and be able to work offline or save your progress often (for example, this is the second draft of this review because the wifi went out when I tried to submit my first).

"Strange Brew, Austin Coffee "," 9/29/2015 I like Strange Brew mainly because they are open 24/7 and they have a terrific music venue. The regulars here are friendly. The coffee house is spacious and the quiet area is useful.  However, like many gathering places in Austin, it gets crowded. The parking lot gets crowded too. I could not imagine trying to study here during busy hours, yet many people do. You may have to wait in a long line to order during peak hours, although the staff works at a fast pace to accommodate the customers.  There are usually smokers out front which means you will get smoke on your clothes when you enter and exit. This is unfortunate, but pretty standard for any bar, coffee house, or music venue in Austin.  The wi-fi is slow during peak hours, too. There is not a lot of bandwidth for the amount of traffic.  In a nutshell, I like this place but always avoid it during busy hours. I appreciate the quality of the music they present. Their wi-fi has served me well during late nights and early mornings.

"Strange Brew, Austin Coffee "," 1/30/2014 107 check-ins I love Strange Brew! Sure, their prices are higher than the other local coffee shops but they are open 24 hours & that in itself is awesome! Even the corporate coffee chains in the area don't stay open 24 hours. I discovered this place in 2011 when I used to live in the neighborhood & still occasionally stop by. What amazes me is how much they've grown throughout this time. This ""tiny coffeehouse"" has since taken up space on either side, now consuming much of the former shopping center it's located in. To the left is the ""Lounge Side"" music venue, which I believe has it's own check in. They have a smal bar & live music nightly. There's almost always a cover charge but if they're hosting a musician whose familiar to you, it's totally worth checking out.   To the right are multiple seating rooms, great for small meetings & gatherings. As Chiqui B noted in 2011, Strange Brew didn't offer much seating in it's humble beginnings but they do have plenty of seating now & a few bike racks for those who prefer alternative transportation... Which leads me to their parking situation. SB does have a big parking lot but good luck finding parking during the afternoon/evenings, especially when a well-known artist is performing. I've had no trouble finding parking in the AM but have passed on the opportunity to give the business my support during the afternoons many times due to the lack of a parking space.

The barista recommended their signature drink, the double strange brew, and after I said I prefer things with chocolate he promptly told me he could make it chocolate. My friend got the regular and I the chocolate. Both were excellent (mine was better :P). I would definitely order again. It was sweet, creamy, rich, no flavors jumping out too strongly. Very nice blend of everything.  The seating on the other hand...I don't know. Some people may like that it's not crowded with seating but idk, it just felt like there was a LOT of empty areas that could have accommodated more people. It was also insanely quiet, so if you're going to study...this may be a good place to go. If however, you need complete silence...beware those that go out for coffee to chat (like me....). It's SO quiet here that any voices seem to annoy everyone around. Oh well. There is a quiet study area that is meant to be quiet always.

One of my favorite coffee houses. ", pos 
"Strange Brew, Austin Coffee ", 1/20/2015 1 check-in I spent several hours at strange brew writing on my laptop and reading. This is very much my style of coffee place where I don't feel rushed. They were busy but not overwhelmed on a rainy day and I'd hang out here anytime. Reminds of college and spending time in coffee shops.  All I had was warm green tea during my visit but I'll be happy to try other options and grab a cappuccino next time I'm in. , pos

"Strange Brew, Austin Coffee "," 7/20/2014 South Austin enterprise on Manchaca Road just North of Stassney offers: coffee shop with sandwich menu, quiet rooms for work/study, internet access, patio area out back, shaded porch in front, free parking and - the icing on the cake - one of the best live music rooms in Austin, Texas.  I have been going here since the place opened. The owner is totally dedicated to the live music and it shows. Here is a breakdown of what I like about Strange Brew.    LIVE MUSIC ROOM:  The sound system is outstanding. Strange Brew's music venue is called Lounge Side and has won five awards from SXSW over the past two years. The ""door"" fees begin at free for some musicians then rise to $6.00 and up.  You can find out who is playing on their web site and can purchase tickets in advance.  Music starts early and we often take in the 4 PM or 6 PM shows. The audience is respectful and quiet is appreciated. The place has a neighborhood hangout feel and many in the audience seem to know each other and the musicians well. Hospitality toward new customers is very good. There is a wine and beer bar and table service. I really like that you can have coffee in the music room and can also order grilled sandwiches and other food either from the barkeeper or direct from the barista at the coffee counter just outside the door. The staff books a wide range of musicians - mostly Americana, but also jazz, blues, C&W, folk and some creative genres as well. Joe Ely, Malford Milligan, Jeff Plankenhorn, Jimmie Dale Gilmore, Justin Welch, Emily Gimble, Ernie Durawa and many other well-known Texas musicians - some who play on the road as far away as Europe - may be enjoyed here. There are frequent guest musician appearances and I think that some new material is tried out in this room.  FOOD AND COFFEE: The barista and ordering stand is just inside the main door. This is not a fancy place and has a limited, but adequate menu. There are cold drinks in the cooler. Iced tea is provided. Coffee purchases come with a free refill. I am a black coffee drinker and enjoy their brews, but can't comment on their lattes and other coffee drinks. The grilled cheese sandwich is very tasty. The Rueben is one of the best in town. There are pastries including muffins and banana nut breads. Prices are fair compared to other establishments. The wine bar in the music room has a small selection of beers and wines.  QUIET AND WORKSPACE:  There are several rooms with good seating for those who ant to be alone with their coffee and computer.  Being close to Austin Community College brings a steady flow of customers who make this a study hall away from home. Guidelines for purchases to support the free Wi-Fi and seating space seem fair to me.  PATIO and PORCH:  I thoroughly enjoy sitting in a chair out on the front porch with coffee and a snack and listening to music in the background. Very relaxing on a warm evening. Good place to meet friends.  So, if you are from out of town and you want an Austin neighborhood experience, this is a good place to try.  If you live 15 minutes away as I do, then this is a place you can go and enjoy on a whim.  LATE REPORT - Just got back from an enjoyable two hours at Strange Brew Lounge Side. Durawa with Ernie Durawa on drums, Chris Alcarez on bass and Will Knaack on lead guitar plus guest on keyboards and organ - Mark Goodwin - put on a blast of a show - just superior bluesy jazzy music and vocals plus high energy antics on stage. Had a Malbec and a coffee. Great night!! Again!! I interacted with 4 employees and 3 musicians and all were hospitable and pleasant to me. The small wine and beer bar at Lounge Side. Table service is also provided. Memory of the early days when the place opened. Love settin' out on that covered front porch. See all photos from Stephen S. for Strange Brew, Austin Coffee ", pos

Quack’s 43rd Street Bakery ," 11/18/2016 I found Quack's Bakery in Hyde Park when I stayed for a few days at the lovely ""Cottage at Duval Garden Airbnb"" on Duval St.   Quacks offers pastries, croissants, muffins, cookies, pies, cakes and cupcakes - all freshly baked everyday on the premises.  They also offer a variety of juices and coffee or tea.    It's a charming neighborhood bakery with a lot of locals and students that meet there to relax and chat in a comfy laid back atmosphere.  The yummy, freshly homebaked quality is exactly what I miss so much since Starbucks took over the coffee scene.  I also found myself loading up on apple danish, peach muffins and banana nut bread to take with me and snack on later. ", pos 
Quack’s 43rd Street Bakery ," 10/31/2016 Quack's is a great stop and go place where you can pick up a sweet treat and be on your way. The interior of this place isn't that conducive to studying due to the lack of tables and outlets. Half of the space is dedicated to the bakery display, with the other half devoted to a sitting area. In addition, I think their drinks are pretty average, so stick to the baked goods.  Other than that, I think Quack's has excellent cookies and cupcakes, and they always have really adorably decorated sugar cookies (got a ghost for Halloween) that make for a great gift. Service can be hit or miss, but Quack's definitely has that Austin vibe going for it and has its own particular charm. ", pos 
Quack’s 43rd Street Bakery ," 10/18/2016 1 check-in This place is damn charming. When I was younger I had no idea it was around the corner. Probably good for my little fatso self to be honest.  Could not help myself and bought a few pastries as well as a cookie. The cookies are cute and taste good but the sugary coating gets a little dry. The shortbread underneath is still good and hey, it's fun eating a mummy's face!  The jalapeño cheese croissant is so good. I could have those everyday.  The drip is not half bad either.

Quack’s 43rd Street Bakery ," 12/2/2016 1 check-in Quack's is a quirky little place in Hyde Park... cute for it's no frills ambience.  A friend recommended the place for their pie.  We ordered a whole strawberry rhubarb pie and as a lover of strawberry rhubarb pie, I would say it was above average in taste and a wee bit expensive ($25).  The filling was good but I could use more strawberries, and a little more tart.  The crust was average, a little tasteless to be honest.  I also had the peanut butter, snickerdoodle, and chocolate chip cookies and they were nothing amazing.  Carrot cake was also just okay.  Standout of the night was their key lime tart!  Graham cracker crust was great, filling was tart... loved it.  I'll probably be back to give some of their other selections a try... and for the key lime tart!

The carrot cupcake had seeds and a really nice texture, probably my favorite carrot anything ever. The chocolate cupcake meanwhile was tasty and moist, the top was both chocolate and peanut butter and while it was a little too much for me, was the perfect amount for my friend. This business also has sandwiches, coffee, and pies (to order), as well as photographs hung up for sale.

Quack’s 43rd Street Bakery ," 7/23/2016 38 check-ins This local bakery has been a staple in Hyde Park for decades. There is usually a line to the door and it is always worth the wait. I knocked it down a star for service. I wish the staff would just be a little more ""with it"". Maybe they are so high off of all the sugar they crash and burn at the service counter?!!  Favorites- chocolate ginger cookie, salty oat, snickerdoodle, ok all their cookies! Regular rotation of fun design on sugar cookies. Chocolate ganache cake, walnut scone, carrot cake. Barristas make a mean latte!  Sometimes lacking- needs more blueberries in the muffin, scones are sometimes a little on the dry side.  Tips- get there right after 6pm for discounted daily breakfast items. Any shortbread cookie can be designed just for you if you place an order of 12 or more. I ordered champagne flutes, bottles and ""40 and fabulous"" cookies for a friend's birthday and they turned out, well, fabulous!  Thanks Quack's for always been there!

Sadly, I think I had it bookmarked for 3 years now lol  Anyway, Quack's is located in the very charming Hyde Park neighborhood with lots of other great local shops around. It was quite busy for a Saturday morning, as you can imagine, and I was overwhelmed by all the options. They seem to have everything here, and is heaven for a sugar addict.  I opted for the pumpkin bread (because I love pumpkin everything) and an iced coffee with almond milk in it. Both were too sweet for me but I'm not knocking the place...it IS a place for sweets ;)  I really wish I would have tried the salted oak or the nutella tea cookies which were mentioned in others reviews.

With a decorative outside with a big white duck and big words ""Quack's 43rd Street Bakery"", you will have a great experience with their various baked pastries. From bread, cookies, muffins, cupcakes and drinks, they offer such a wide variety that suits all tastes and flavors!  When my parents came up a couple of weeks ago, we visited here and got these items: Oatmeal Creme Pie, Blueberry Muffin and Lemon Pound Cake All of these are delicious! The Oatmeal Creme Pie is humongous and has the right proportion of cream to cookie. The Blueberry Muffin is fall apart in your mouth, the perfect sweetness and lots of blueberries. The Lemon Pound Cake reminded me of Starbucks' Lemon Cake but like 10 times better!  Great atmosphere to sit and have a chat, to study, or to enjoy good company! Come now! ", pos

At work we place large cupcake orders all the time for clients and Julia always kicks major ass at responding to my emails and makes sure they're perfect before I pick them up. Quack's is perfect for business and pleasure, if you will. They're great at taking business orders and awesome at walk up service too.  Everyone I have encountered there has been a pleasure ordering from and talking to. May I recommend their SNICKERDOODLE COOKIES. That had to be all caps because they're the best snickerdoodles I have ever had. Sorry, Tiff's - Quack's proves you can have delicious snickerdoodle cookies, the size of your face without having to be gooey and fresh from the oven. So if you're reading this, future boyfriend/husband, the way to my heart is Quack's snickerdoodles. Other delicacies I have enjoyed are the Fricano sandwiches that they toast to perfection and their croissants (that WILL sell out in the morning). I'll be sad the day I leave Hyde Park and Quack's isn't a drive or walk away! ", pos

Quack’s 43rd Street Bakery ," 7/8/2016 1 check-in If you subscribe to the ""Keep Austin Weird"" mantra, then Quack's is the bakery for you.  I sometimes have a hard time finding the ""weird"" in Austin, a city that is trying hard to hold onto its roots while embracing its celebrity status in the hipster world.  But Quack's is a holdover from a time when the eclectic defined this outpost in the Lone Star State.  Quack's main draw has to be the sweets and Quack's has plenty of them. Whether your sweet tooth craves cookies or cupcakes or pies or cakes, you're sure to find something to bring a smile to your face. The hardest decision you may have to make is what to eat at one of the tables frequented by the locals.  If you're smart, you'll do what I do, get a slice of key lime tart to enjoy I house with a cuppa Joe any a bag of cookies and cupcakes to take home with you. You can never have too many sweets.

Quack's serves them with a pickle (optional) and with a bag of chips (get the sweet potato ones if you're into sweet potato). Got a 20 oz iced caramel latte with it and everything came out to a little over $11. Which I am totally OK with since the sandwich was packed with ingredients and got a medium coffee.  Service was great, superb even. The manager started to take my order, but seemed distracted and politely asked another employee to help me since he couldn't focus on me (due to another issue he had to deal with that the new person serving me relayed to me).  Everyone that works here seems to be so genuinely nice and it really ups the atmosphere. Plenty of outlets, plenty of tables for such a small space, and the big windows make it a great place to study or work at during the day. Lots of natural lighting. Wi-fi errs on the faster side compared to all the coffeeshops/cafes I've been to.  They have a huge selection of desserts: pies, cookies, croissants, cakes, cupcakes. You name it, they probably got it.  Can't tell if it's in a neighborhood or on the edge of one; either way, the location makes it feel, for lack of a better word, homey...or I guess, neighborly? I can't see how anyone could have a problem with this place, but then again, everyone has different experiences. Maybe I got lucky with a having a great one here. ", pos

That being said, I have had many more positive experiences lately at Quack's - the service has definitely been more positive - they make an effort to ask how I'm doing and whatnot, and the place has in general been a lot cleaner.  I will say that I always receive a warm latte, which quickly cools down - kind of disappointing. I wish they would make them a little bit hotter!

We landed late in Austin and after grabbing dinner and checking out Formula 1's downtown FanFest -- it was after 10. Most bakeries are closed at that time. Luckily for us, Quack's was open!  The service was great. Very patient with us as we scanned each display case for which treat we wanted. We finally went with a chocolate caramel brownie (delicious), pumpkin sugar cookie (really good), salty oats cookie (my wife was obsessed) and they gave us a free chocolate cat cookie (my wife was also obsessed).

Tart, sweet fresh bursting lime flavor in a gelled custard with thick crust. Mmmmmmmmmmmmmm  I tried some apple pie too but it sadly wasn't that great. A bit too mushy.

Quack’s 43rd Street Bakery ," 7/6/2016 Listed in Kaffe I have been trying cafes around Austin for two months now, and Quack's is by far my favorite.  Ambiance-wise, if I had to put words to the interior I'd have to go with Grungespresso -- in an endearing way -- and the quality of their espresso beats most other shops by miles.  It was also here that my best friend was coerced, begrudgingly, to enter a coffee shop for the first time (he isn't keen on the bean) and it's also where he discovered a deep love for their baked goods.  According to him, the cherry danish is better than the other pastries he's sampled as I have dragged him along on my journey across the espresso river of Austin.  He also now looks forward to visiting new cafes, but he agrees that Quack's is still his favorite.  Most importantly, have you seen their logo?  It's a space duck.  Forget about their smooth espresso; pay no mind to their buttery, flaky pastries; even their extremely kind and patient baristas that always have neato hair and answer any questions without an air...  Okay, don't forget about all of that but still, space duck. ", pos

If their cakes and cupcakes were better they would get 4 stars-but they're not.

For April Fool's they had designed a cup cake to look like mash potatoes (see my picture of this foolish delight!) I personally love their lattes and the staff is friendly.    Tables are a bit small but large enough to place your lap top and still have some room for your coffee.  It can get fairly busy so there are times when you might not find a table available inside.  However, there is seating outside and normally tables are available.  If you plan to have a group meeting and have multiple laptops open you may have some limited space issues.

They didn't have any but provided they were able to get one made. Order was taken with payment over the phone.  We arrived and cake was ready with the surprise note. We took the cake to which we tried hours later.  German chocolate was perhaps one of the best if not the absolute best. My friend loved the freshly made cake. Healthy rich chocolate, hearty amount of nuts and coconut. We all thought the cake was well crafted.  We saved some for later because well there was only five of us eating a eight person cake. The cake was not nearly enjoyable. Definitely aged to be more rich. Still good just way much sugar.  Good: freshly made cake and quick service. Bad: wish the cake held better for an extra day.

Legit great coffee .... not always found at bakeries, but found here 3. Friendly, helpful staff .... don't know what to get? they'll help you! 4. Cute, comfy space if you need to hang around for a while  To top all of this off, the prices are great and they're open late! ", pos 
Quack’s 43rd Street Bakery ," 11/9/2015 Updated review OMG- I came here before my starting my new diet plan and got the salty oat cookie, chocolate cookie and a few Halloween cookies. Perhaps my favorite cookie in life. It's even up there with my fave cookie from Levain in NYC. OMG. I want these cookies at my wedding but I'm getting married in Louisiana so that might not be feasible but seriously. Best cookies ever. ", pos 
Quack’s 43rd Street Bakery ," 5/16/2016 I really enjoy this neighborhood bakery. It's totally got a bit of that hipster feel, but don't let that scare you away. The first time I was here, I did have a couple slices of pie (key lime and strawberry rhubarb) and I was initially disappointed. It was kept too cold and the pie crust was tough to break and wasn't great. I decided to come back again and the pies were much better. No problems with the crust. I think I might have just been an off day, or the pies just came right out into the display and didn't have enough time to come to room temp. Their pastries, cookies, and other sweet treats have always been delicious, and they have the prettiest cookies. Their coffee is good too.  This is a nice little neighborhood bakery to get your morning or afternoon pick-me-up! Love it! ", pos 
Quack’s 43rd Street Bakery ," 8/29/2016 I got the 16 oz 43rd Street coffee and felt it was a fair price for a decent-tasting coffee.  They have an assortment of baked goods (pause for gasps) and the prices on them seemed about normal and the quality looked good enough.  I felt the tables were a bit too close together, so the wife and I spoke in near whispers as to not disturb the other tables. ", pos 
Quack’s 43rd Street Bakery ," 4/3/2016 Everything I've had is always great and the coffee is nice and rich.  Great pie crusts, buttercream cake frosting, and tasty almond bars: there's something for everyone here. 2 for 1 morning pastries after 6:30 and super duper nice staff.  I've done some work here a couple times and the wifi is good. Seating is typically small tables, so I'm usually here just for the treats. ", pos 
Quack’s 43rd Street Bakery ," 2/20/2016 Great bakery - cupcakes & pies oh my! Got the latte it was delicious. The family loaded up on desserts, peanut butter cupcake, lemon cupcake, mint truffles, and strawberry rhubarb pie.  Thumbs up for all! ", pos 
Quack’s 43rd Street Bakery ," 9/4/2015 I love the oversized cupcakes they make and sell here! They're always so fresh and are never dry and crumbly. The icing on them is quality stuff too - not that scary kind made from a million weird chemicals you can't pronounce.  The guys at the counter are always so friendly and on top of the game service wise. The atmosphere is along the lines of a casual deli. No booths but plenty of wooden tables and chairs. I always see students working away at their laptops here, it's a pretty laid back place. ", pos 
Quack’s 43rd Street Bakery ," 2/18/2016 2 check-ins This place should be better than it is. My first visit was okay enough to warrant a second visit, but my second will be my last. The baked goods aren't anything special and I can get coffee anywhere. Seating is also a problem here. It's overrated and that's why there's never a seat. I'd say skip Quack's. It's not terrible, but there are plenty of other places to get baked goods, dessert and coffee. ", neutral 
Quack’s 43rd Street Bakery ," 10/24/2015 1 check-in Quack's has the best cookies in the world: Czech tea cookies and nutella filled tea cookies.  I used to live super close and I came by quite often, after I moved to what feels like Southern Round Rock I would drive 30min down here just to get a bunch of cookies and eat them all in one sitting whenever I have a rainy day.  For Halloween they are making green witch finger cookies instead of the Czech tea cookies, they taste the same but you have to be into the funky look they have! Witch fingers ", pos 
Quack’s 43rd Street Bakery ," 1/4/2016 2 check-ins Every time I go to Quack's, I'm instantly hit with a wave of sweet, delicious smells, friendly service, and inspiration. Not only do they offer delectable pies with perfectly buttery crusts, intricately decorated sugar cookies, and tasty muffins galore, they also have sandwiches, coffee, and beautifully crafted cakes.  The adorable bakery is a great place to study, catch up, or just to grab a quick bite. I love their muffins and their stuffed breakfast croissants. And I'll always look for any excuse to buy a pie to take home.  You really can't go wrong with any choice you make here. Whether it's breakfast or dessert, Quack's seems to have all bases covered.

Quack’s 43rd Street Bakery ," 2/20/2016 Love this place!  As is usual when a place does something very well the line can sometimes get long but the wait is worth it! The staff here are quite nice and friendly. My husband and I come pretty regular for coffee dates before his classes and I like to come on the weekend and sew.  They make a fantastic Cortado, trust me and order one! I love too many food things here to count but my top favs are the lemon poppy seed loaf, the gingerbread cake, the chocolate raspberry cupcake and the ever lovely strawberry tea cookies. *sigh* Ok. So my favorite-favorite is the lemon poppy seed loaf, they put in almond extract so it's got all my favorite flavors.

Quack’s 43rd Street Bakery ," 7/14/2015 Listed in My C8H10N4O2 Fix Awesome bakery!! Usually not a big fan of tomatoes, but whatever they did with the croissants and tomatoes was freaking delicious.

The oatmeal cream pie!! ", pos 
Quack’s 43rd Street Bakery ," 6/29/2015 9 check-ins If you ask anyone I hang out with, they may tell you I'm a tiny bit obsessed with this place.  I am.    As a previous pastry slave myself, I have nothing but respect and admiration for what these guys do.  And I find myself here nearly weekly.  Quacks has a great selection of pastries: pies (sliced and whole), cookies, cupcakes (vegan too!), breakfast pastries, cakes.  Each is beautifully decorated, with obvious care and consideration (really, the cookies are gorgeous).  Someone back there enjoys what they do.  I've sampled the cupcakes and pies so far (more than I care to admit).  Cupcakes are huge, and topped with a generous topping of perfect buttercream (seriously, it's the optimal 90% butter).  The pies is where they get me though.  Pies are tough!!  You have to master the filling AND the crust to excel - and these guys #nailedit.  The filling is consistently on point across pie types - blueberry, peach, apple, cherry - they've got it.  And their crusts!?!  Butter.  Not under-baked like the usual places - but golden and buttery.  I'm the girl that usually scoops out the filling and attacks the crust - I won't do it here - I'll inhale it all.  The service is consistently friendly (with the exception of some girl last night) and thoughtful.  The place is usually bustling but never busy enough to sacrifice service.  They have a good amount of both indoor and outdoor seating so you can stay awhile - unless you want to scarf your treat on your way home in your car (I won't judge).    Quacks surpasses any other Austin bakery I have yet to try - stop by, grab a chocolate cupcake or a slice of pie and enjoy the neighborhood ambiance.    *There is also a kickbutt cheeseshop a few doors down. Best shortbread cookies. ", pos 
Quack’s 43rd Street Bakery ," 7/21/2016 I'm updating my review to 5 stars because the manager fixed the waste water problem. Responsive and caring- so appreciated.  Excellent value; love his place and am in there every day.  I do wish they'd do something about speeding up the standing in line thing which can be soooo tedious here, but what the heck - on balance this place is great, and VALUE is practically unheard of in Austin restaurants, so THANK YOU, QUACK'S!  Super nice staff always. ", pos 
Quack’s 43rd Street Bakery ," 5/30/2015 2 check-ins I finally found a place where the pastries are the perfect sweetness for me. I can count on Quack's for a cupcake that won't leave me worrying about getting diabetes.  Since their cupcakes change daily, I don't know half the time what I'm getting. But the cupcakes always turn out to be delicious, and I especially like their cupcake icing. I once got a mint chocolate cupcake expecting the icing to be sweet. However when I bit into it I was amazed by how delicious it was and how it wasn't...sweet. I think I gobbled that thing down in one bite...kind of like how Patrick did with his chocolate bar in Spongebob, and then blamed Spongebob for eating his chocolate bar since he didn't remember eating his.  I do frequently come here, especially after eating at nearby restaurants like Hyde Park Bar & Grill. A few times though Quacks ran out of pretty much everything! Well who could blame them when you have loyal customers who spend hours inside the bakery, and eating everything that touches the display cases. ", pos 
Quack’s 43rd Street Bakery ," 4/21/2016 This was such a letdown. I ordered quite a few desserts as a pick me up for me and my boyfriend. He wanted to try a macaroon for the first time and I honestly searched high and low for a place near us that made them. Quacks was the only bakery that had them readily available. I was so excited. When I got there, I ordered two different cupcakes, two different macaroons, and a lemon bar. The macaroons were okay but definitely not what I was expecting. The lemon bar was good. The cupcakes were a pretty huge thumbs down for me. It was just such a long drive (Round Rock to downtown-ish Austin) for what we got... ", neutral 
Quack’s 43rd Street Bakery ," 2/24/2016 Their chocolate chip cookies are better than Tiff's Treats.  The cupcakes on the other hand, are terrible. I've tried three kinds just to test it.  The frosting has very little flavor, and tastes more like lard than frosting.  Go if you want a cookie, but not for their cupcakes. ", neutral 
Quack’s 43rd Street Bakery ," 6/2/2016 This place is unreal! My husband and I have come in several times to indulge in the awesome pies. When I found out that we were expecting a baby girl, I went in looking for some type of pink dessert that I could surprise him with. When they didn't have anything available, I asked the guy at the register if they had anything pink in the back (I told him what it was for) and he told me to wait just a moment. He came back and said that they did not, but instead he went in the back and got a fresh cupcake and they topped it with pink icing just for me! I was able to surprise my hubs with a delicious cupcake to reveal the babys gender. Such a great customer experience. ", pos 
Quack’s 43rd Street Bakery ," 4/14/2016 This is a serious post. I am completely and utterly in love with the chocolate cake.

I am definitely going back and trying something else, only if my cake decides we're not exclusive, that is. ", pos 
Quack’s 43rd Street Bakery ," 12/8/2015 Updated review Listed in where i work... sometimes. #1) I really do love it here. The staff is always cool, the coffee, snacks, and music are always great. #2) But, lately the place has smelled like a sewer. Not sure what's going on. Now of course sh!t happens. And I assume they are working on it. Not everything can be idyllic at every moment. I understand this. I hope this changes soon.  I'd rather be talking about their wonderful carrot cake.... or... sigh, their magnificent chocolate ganache cake. Or their simple but perfect salty oatmeal cookie. These are the things I'll try to focus on.  Quack's is one of the greats. I'll put these last few days behind me and focus on a new movement. A movement to be more positive and go with the flow. Let us all forget #2 and get a fresh start tomorrow. ", neutral

Quack’s 43rd Street Bakery ," 1/27/2016 My family came here after having a meal out. Lots of cookies, brownies, pies and cakes. I didn't find anything to be out of this world, but it was certainly good.  Everyone had different items and we were all happy. It was sort of late, so many items were gone and well picked over.  Staff was friendly and the patrons were colorful. ", neutral 
Quack’s 43rd Street Bakery ," 11/15/2015 The staff there are apparently very busy.  They walk in and out of the kitchen without (or avoiding) making eye contact with customers.  Even though there's a line of customers waiting there, we had to wait for somebody to show up at the registry.  The three stars are for the taste of the desserts.  They are absolutely delicious, except that the brownies are a bit mushy.  They all taste very rich, making me wonder how healthy they were... maybe I shouldn't worry about that about desserts...  ------- Update on 3/18/2016: I just noticed that the manager actually responded to my comment a few days after I posted it.  I am very happy that they take customers' comments seriously and try to address them immediately.  So here's one more star for that!   We did went back once in February (2 months later).  There was a line (probably as always) too, but this time there was somebody at the registry.  We got a variety of desserts except for the brownies because I didn't know at the time that the manager had promised to address the issue.  Next time I'll get some brownies and will let you all know what I think!  ;-) ", pos 
Quack’s 43rd Street Bakery ," 12/1/2015 All of their baked goods are delicious.  I also love the fact that if you come in after 6 pm (or 6:30pm), you get buy one, get one free on their pastries.  They have exceptional gingerbread.  It's incredibly moist and you can definitely taste the fresh ginger in it.  They also have a salted oatmeal cookie that is to die for.  I never thought that combo would work, but it's perfect together.  I've been meaning to try their sandwiches; from what I've heard, those are amazing too.  There's really no way to go wrong with this place.  It's a must try. ", pos

The coffee isn't specialty coffee but its solid diner style black water! They have a wide variety of pastries available. I'm a scone fanatic so I had to try their walnut scone! SOOOOGOOD!!! My Texan friends got some sort of hot bread with vegetarian sausages wrapped in it. Another one of my visiting vegan friends was amazed that it was made of vegetables because it tasted so good, so hit that up too! There is plenty of seating, but it can get quite busy in there during breakfast hours. The prices! I fell in love with the prices! My scone was huge and it was $2! After having paid $4-6 for smaller pastries in NYC this was an amazing change of pace. ", pos

Quack’s 43rd Street Bakery ," 3/2/2015 The best breakfast ever is a piece of tiramisu at 5:45am with coffee, of course. I am savoring one as I write to you.  Easy to park and run in with kids in tow and get filled up on sweets, caffeine, and people watching. They have vegan cupcakes, but no specifically dedicated gluten-free cakes, cookies, cupcakes, etc ... My daughter was slightly disappointed, but we made a special stop at another place for her on the way home. My favorite item to get as gifts are the decorated cookies, whose design changes constantly and has a seasonal theme. I get so excited anticipating what will be in my line of sight.  The tables are 1st come, 1st seat and you will need to clean your table yourself. As you line-up to order at their counter, each step allows you to linger in front of the display case of goodies. It is hard to make up your mind. Sometimes I just get everything I want and deal with it later in the privacy of my home.  Tiramisu for breakfast is pretty great. You got to try this! ", pos

Very seasonal decorating, which makes me smile. Perfect for when you have some free time (like while doing laundry next door) and right by the post office. The music is pretty chill.  The coffee is nothing special but it's not bad by any means. Pro tip: the lattes and cappuccinos are what clog up the line.

Quack’s 43rd Street Bakery ," 5/4/2014 1 check-in Listed in What's Hot or Not in 2014?! I almost forked my beloved husband to get the last luscious bite of our shared slice of coconut cream pie! If you value your dining companion, buy your own slice for $3.99. (-; It was yummy, fresh, and not too sweet.  Quack's 43rd Street Bakery makes all their baked goods, and it's hard to choose from among the many temptations. It's located in the Hyde Park neighborhood of central Austin.  I also ordered a Cajun turkey sandwich with jalapeños and melted Pepper jack on sourdough with spicy spread. Yes even the lettuce gets the panini treatment, which gives the lettuce a wilty texture, so I'd suggest you order this sammy without the lettuce. They don't make the sandwich bread in-house. While I was satisfied with the sandwich, it wasn't outstanding.  My Crowbar latte had 4 shots of espresso. Smooth and strong. I'm awake Austin! Excellent espresso!  There are plenty of tables, and a coffee house atmosphere with eclectic music. Next time I'm in the area, I NEED to try the key lime tart at Quack's.  Quack's earns 4 stars because it's a great choice for bakery treats and coffees when you're in the Hyde Park area. But I wouldn't drive out of my way to get to Quack's if a sandwich was what I was craving. On the other hand, if fresh pie and an excellent iced espresso were on my mind, I might drive out of my way for their great bakery.  My suggestion to the owners is to create a 5-star sandwich which Yelpers will dream about at home or at work. Create a sandwich which entices hungry Yelpers to drive out of their way for. A 5 star sandwich wins out over the competition.  Quack's has the atmosphere of a relaxing coffee house with eclectic music. The owners may wish to get more creative with the decor and the ""vibe"", if they want to create an unforgettable impression on new customers.    On my next visit to Austin, I look forward to returning to Quack's if I'm in the neighborhood, and I recommend that you give their great bakery a try! Lunch at Quack's: his iced green tea, my Crowbar latte, our coconut cream pie, and my Cajun turkey panini sandwich. My Cajun turkey sandwich with jalapeños spiced up my day! Quacks.

They also offer cakes and pies whole or by the slice, French macarons, petit fors, cupcakes, eclairs, etc in the cold cases...it's like a breakfast + dessert dream come true. I'm pretty sure their secret is putting a ton of actual butter in everything. The shop is bright and inviting, with lots of windows and small tables for a quick chat over coffee, or for students to hunker down for a bit. I love that they are open until 11pm every day!

Quack’s 43rd Street Bakery ," 3/6/2016 To those new to Austin that are searching for their go-to: Give it a try one day, but keep looking.  The service is unwelcoming and pretty passive aggressive. My boyfriend and I decided to try this place out because of a friend's recommendation. We took some time to look over the menu options for a bit but the staff seemed annoyed and almost impatient with us. We weren't even in line or anywhere near the cash register, which I found odd, but whatever. What really did rub me the wrong way was when we did get around to placing our orders, the cashier was as rude as Donald Trump at a campaign rally. For example, I kindly asked her about their tea lattes and something in her expression visibly turned sour. I'll never forget how she narrowed her eyes and pointed at their tea selections behind her, not even bothering to name some of them, just mumbling that this was what they had. Once the orders were placed, there was no eye contact and no ""thank you, have a nice day."" She immediately moved on to the next customer. Very poor manners.  We ordered some of their sandwiches with a coffee and tea latte. It was overall good, but I found out that their sandwiches aren't even made in-house (they are pre-prepared from somewhere else, I believe) which was disappointing. We heard they had fresh baked goods but we didn't get to try any.  The hot drinks are all right but they get cold pretty quickly. The seating situation is a nightmare, but we got lucky and found somewhere to sit outside. I can't speak for indoor seating, but from what I saw they don't do a good job at wiping off some of the empty tables inside. Outdoor tables are small and wobbly - chairs included. The atmosphere was chill, for the most part.  I'm not sure if I would come back for the rude service or drinks. Maybe I could overlook those two things if I wanted to try their baked goods or sandwiches again, but when a staff member treats customers like they don't belong then it's hard to get that bad taste out of your mouth. I suggest that if you don't practice common courtesy, or keep a professional face on at all times, then you don't belong in the service industry. ", neutral 
Quack’s 43rd Street Bakery ," 11/5/2015 [UPDATED] Have tried almost all their savory snacks, and this is most of the times my brunch place to go on weekends or sometimes weekdays.

Kolachies were really very good. Very different from the others i have had before. Wish I could say the same for bagel. The bagel, according to my co-worker who had it, was stale.

Quack’s 43rd Street Bakery ," 12/4/2013 1 check-in The last time I was at Quack's, I was waxing on and on about a failed relationship to a distant relative of Amelia Earhart who wouldn't shut up about how annoying it was that Hilary Swank got cast in that movie that nobody watched. I mean, yeah, you can barely understand me and my whining through the baked goods I'm shoveling into the hole in my face, but do you really have to add insult to injury by bringing up Hilary Swank when you know I have a personal vendetta against her!? I digress.  Needless to say, I was long overdue for a visit. I ordered an iced coffee to start on while I took about an hour to decide on what I wanted. I narrowed it down to two and did what anyone trying to cut back on calories would do: I ordered both of them. The sour cream coffee cake and the vegan lemon blueberry cupcake. I can't decide which one I liked more. When baked goods are this perfect, I'm going to choose to believe that calories don't exist. Because why would they?  The staff are all awesome, the atmosphere is great for reading, eating, studying, reading, chewing, talking, not talking, and any other activity you could want to do in a coffee shop or a bakery.

Juan Pelota ," 10/8/2015 1 check-in Once you get past the sophomoric name and the bike-bro trappings, you're left with pretty much everything you want from a coffee shop: comfortable seating (inside and out), friendly baristas, reliable WiFi and good coffee.  They even have their own (free) parking lot, which is pretty much unheard of downtown these days.  Watch out for those early closing times, though. This is definitely not a night spot. ", pos 
Juan Pelota ," 10/10/2015 1 check-in Who knew a great coffee shop was hiding in a bike shop? I found one in Juan Perlota. I got a delicious Latte after viewing the board discussing the espresso used and the notes after tasting. My nephew and niece got smoothies. We enjoyed both. I enjoyed the environment, but I'm not sure it was as relaxing as some coffee shops. If you are a bike enthusiast, this would be like heaven. But, I'm not, so it was a lot to take in sitting instead of peddling.. Latte! ", pos 
Juan Pelota ," 9/21/2015 1 check-in Solid coffee, but it wasn't amazing enough to have to deal with the crowd from all the bicyclists during the weekend (it's too many people to have to keep dodging). They share the building with a bicycle shop (apparently co-owned by Lance Armstrong) and I believe it's an open concept so you can walk back and forth between the two places. We came in around 11:30am on a Saturday, and Juan Pelota was super crowded with almost all bicyclists. However, the line wasn't that long and it moved quickly, so I was able to get my Cold Brew ($4.50, yelp.com/user_local_phot…) in less than 10 minutes. The cold brew was smooth and tasted good, but it was on the pricier side. I would come back on a day that was more calm, but wouldn't go out of my way to be back. Cold Brew ($4.50) ", neutral

Beware people and groups that use two or more tables to put their laptops, backpacks and other stuff. You may have to ask politely for them to use less room and be more sharing of the common space.  The background music is at the right volume so you're not bothered by it.  Many cyclists will come by as this seems to be their pit stop downtown and where they socialize with the cyclist community.

It shares a building with Mellow Johnny's, a high-end bicycle store.  I got the cold mocha on a warm summer day and it was pretty good.  The barista was nice, smiley, and unpretentious.  The drinks are fairly-priced.  The cold mocha was $4 pre-tax.  You pay on an iPad.  There is a neat conference table shaped like a tree.  There are comfortable chairs near electrical outlets.  There is free Wifi.  I like the tall windows letting in lots of natural light.  There is lots of covered outdoor seating.  I'd be there if the sun wasn't shining on it.

Juan Pelota ," 6/28/2013 47 check-ins Listed in Great Austin Coffee Houses The barista at Juan Pelota's asked me if this was my first time at Juan Pelota's and I had to admit yes.  I also had to admit that when in this part of downtown I usually gravitate to Halcyon for my coffee fix.  Luckily they weren't offended and even told me that they concur that Halcyon has great coffee.  Though theirs is better.  And better is probably accurate.  As others have noted Juan Pelota brews Stumptown coffee out of Portland which is pretty rad.  Not only that but on my visit they were specifically brewing Stumptown's Hair Bender blend which is my favorite.  I had my coffee at 6PM and couldn't get off to sleep until 3AM.  It does the trick which is what makes caffeine the #1 most consumed drug in the entire world.  Note that a regular sized iced latte will set you back (including tip, and you should definitely tip) around $5.  This is higher than most coffee drinks downtown, even with the downtown premium built in.  But I promise it will be worth it.  As Kelly S noted since this place shares the building with Mellow Johnny's it is Guy Central.  As in very cute, very athletic guy central.  The 2 hours that I hung out there working on my laptop I discovered that I was the only female in the entire joint including both those who hung out inside and grabbed their coffee to go.    They close at 7PM during the week and 5PM on weekends so not a good late night coffee spot.  But during the day when in this part of downtown I will definitely be making more coffee stops here for some of that lovely Stumptown coffee. ", pos

Juan Pelota ," 10/25/2014 This place offers single-origin pour over coffee, vegan lattés, free parking, and some outdoor seating.

Personally, I find most of their music selection to be distracting when I'm working or studying. I'm in the market for a coffee shop with a chiller vibe but this place offers many awesome perks for group studying that are hard to match.  During the week they usually have green cart vegetarian wraps and a small selection of other sandwiches. They also have healthy smoothies, gluten-free black bird pastries and fancy, single-origin chocolate.

Juan Pelota ," 9/28/2012 Sure, coffee isn't their main business, as this is an extension of Mellow Johnny's. It's bikes. But this has become one of my favorite coffee places in Austin, alongside Jo's on South Congress.  Thing is, I'm a stickler about the environment I'm sitting in. Being an architect will do that to you. Most coffee places are too dark, with uncomfortable seating, and obnoxious music. Juan Pelota has giant, south facing shaded windows, meaning there's always plenty of light and no glare, modern and comfortable chairs, and practically no music in the background. Instead, there is the white noise of an active bike shop, which I prefer. Plus, it never gets too crowded.  As for the coffee, I've only gotten the iced versions, which are really, really strong. My friend thinks they are too strong. It depends on your preferences, I guess, since my other friend appreciated how strong the drinks were. I'm not much of a coffee aficionado outside of cappuccinos, so I can't say more than that. And I haven't had their cappuccino yet.  But mainly, I just really like sitting here, getting work done inside, or sitting on the patio catching up with friends. And having Mellow Johnny's attached it a plus. Really nice people, really helpful with my bike questions, and lots of cool stuff. A new go-to place in downtown. ", pos 
Juan Pelota ," 7/11/2012 Loving this place so far. I've been in Austin a month and been working from as many coffee shops as possible. For me the difference lies in the details. Helpful staff who are happy to have a conversation, simple syrup and chocolate powder at the sugar station, ubiquitous new wall outlets, nice dark wood tables that don't wobble. (Of course I haven't checked all the tables but I did just see a girl check one's stability- it met her sturdiness standards so she took a seat.) It looks like they may have taken notice of the reviewer who complained about thin wooden chairs, as they now have sturdy, functional metal ones and a comfy leather-padded bench against the back wall.  They currently have a large projector screen showing the Tour de France on mute (they do share space with a bike shop, but there's been no problem with noise or hustle bustle). Not sure if that's a regular thing, but if it's on and you want to ignore it, you can face squarely away from it at any of the tables.  The only issue I had was that WiFi was down when I arrived. Mistakes happen, but it's how you resolve the problem that matters. I brought up the problem and it was fixed in no time. I suggested that they add a password to the router so the neighbors might stop overloading it; we'll see if they take that advice.  The best testament to how much I like the place is that this is my first Yelp review. I'll be back, and not only to say hello to Genevieve! Few things I appreciate more than nice, new, ubiquitous wall outlets at coffee shops. ", pos

Juan Pelota ," 5/1/2012 1 check-in Not a bad place to chill after a bike ride or to loiter when meeting friends nearby. They offered macarons during SX as well as free wifi and an enjoyable ambiance.  It's pretty relaxed for the small size and the less-than-stellar thin wooden chairs. I remember thinking they were built for cyclist bodies or for encouraging people not to hang out for too long, but I'd imagine it's designed more for a quick stop. Even if for resting cyclists, though, they weren't too comfortable.  Something I do like about it is that it's along a little corner between Rio and Nueces, so there's not too much traffic and is really accessible by bike. Being linked to Mellow Johnny's is pretty nice to allow perusing when boredom hits. ", neutral 
Juan Pelota ," 3/2/2015 his is my favorite coffee shop to get an iced vanilla latte in town! i like my coffee drinks cold, strong, creamy, and sweet - and this place gets in done. they use stumptown beans and offer bfast tacos from fresas and pastries from elizabeth street cafe. the employees are always friendly (and not super snobby) and parking is easy. ", pos 
Juan Pelota ," 6/21/2013 Let's start with the beans, they're Stumptown, which if you're from or ever visited Portland, OR, Austin's hip(si)ster-city, you probably are very familiar with these beans and extremely excited to hear this.  If you're from anywhere else, just know that they're well regarded and probably roast while wearing ironic monocles.    Continuing on with the service; since this is my morning coffee spot, it's rare that I am able to converse with anyone in any intelligible way because my brain is repetitively sending one single message: ""get coffee you stupid sleep-deprived moron"" (my brain is very condescending).  At this place, I especially dislike having this disposition because they probably have the friendliest baristas of any coffee shop in Austin.  They ask you how you're doing, they joke with you, they draw cool pictures in your dirty chai.  They just seem genuinely happy, and it's a great way to start your day, even if you're not quite there yet.  Finally, they also serve breakfast tacos.  I realize this is basically mandatory of any coffee shop in Austin, but it's something that needs to be pointed out.  They also have your normal coffee shop fare: yogurt, pastries, juices, etc. so if you're in need of something non-caffeinated, they've got you covered.  To recap: delicious hipster coffee, awesome service and of course breakfast tacos.  Five stars. ", pos 
Juan Pelota ," 4/19/2011 Juan Pelota has slowly started to win my heart.. I avoided it at first, because I went once and the breakfast taco was really greasy, and the coffee so so but after giving it a second chance I visit quite often for my daily coffee fix.  The coffee is always delicious, and strong (a regular shot of espresso is actually two!) and never too hot to enjoy-a big pet peeve of mine. I've tried a few of the pastries, and its sort of hit or miss but everything is organic and all natural, and they offer a good selection of healthy snacks for when you're on the go.  The barista's are always friendly and helpful (not obnoxiously upbeat as some starbucks baristas can be), and after so long they remember your order. The wait time can be kind of long, so skip it if you're in a hurry, but that's just because everything is done fresh-no big things of steamed milk or pre-ground beans sitting around.  Granted, this place is super convienient for me because it's a block away from work but I will keep coming back-try a caramel latte or iced mocha-delish! ", pos

My husband and I are full-time RVers and spend our summers in Portland, so I've grown accustomed to great coffee and just order it directly from there.  My favorite beans are Stumptown's Hair Bender blend.  As I was looking up Stumptown, I came across a Yelp review about JP and the use of ST's beans.  Was I dreaming this?  Really?  I can get my favorite coffee in Austin?  Yes!  When I went, they were out of the beans I wanted, but told me to come back the next day.  The barista made me a wonderful latte with a Texas shape on top...damn, and he was pretty accurate!  I found out they get freshly-roasted beans delivered on Tues & Fridays.  So hey, Austin, you want good coffee, check them out.  And if you make your own espresso/caps/lattes at home, buy a bag of the Hair Bender beans.  Mighty yummy!

Juan Pelota ," 1/17/2012 JP's is a very functional cafe for me. After a nice cycling trek down from the northern regions it is always nice to stop and refuel. Juan Pelota's is able to provide this in various forms to satisfy the padded shorts and Lycra jersey crowd or shoppers/workers in the downtown area. A Vanilla or Carmel Latte usually does the trick for me before heading back on the road. Coconut water, fresh muffins, scones, croissants and very good breakfast tacos are other options i have enjoyed. They also have cool, locally made health bars such as the Thunderbird Energetica's. There are also sandwiches as well but i have not tried them yet. They have several different coffee blends and after some recommendations from JP's staff, i bought their house blend and an Ethiopian blend as Christmas gifts this year.  It's always an interesting place to come and sit and see all the different kinds of folks who pop in down there.  I often thought how great it would be if they were located more closer to home and away from Condomania. But that's the allure of Juan Pelota's for me.

The $9 chocolate bars (yes, really) and other products on the counter didn't appeal to me, but if you want a truly unique cup of coffee give the Azteca a shot  Edit: Went back in to get the Azteca recently and it was more average than last time, no spicy kick and weaker flavor. Still decent, but at their price range $4 - $6 for their smoothies, you can probably find better in Halcyon or other coffee shops ", neutral

The awesome employees enjoy their job, at least that is how it seems. Why would you want to grab a cup o' joe here? I guess parking or getting here is sort of an issue, as it is tucked back into a little west-downtown corner.  They follow the trend of offering ""local, green, hip"" caffeinated beverages, munchies, and things of the like. I just wanted a house dark, but they had decided to dump the older batch and brew a new one. They offered to brew me a pour-ever. Heck, I did not even see pour-over on the menu. Obviously, I was going to go for the hand-crafted goodness.  I had to wait a few minutes for my pour over, but they rewarded my patience with a dark, bold, and well-poured cup of goodness. Fo' free. They appreciated my ""mellow"" manner, and I very much appreciated their accommodating me with the best means possible: coffee on da' hizzouse.  Get your buzz on here, but I cannot guarantee it will be as affordable as my experience. Regardless, this institution will be inviting to all: caffeine junkies, studiers, bikers; heck, I do not even own a bike. Should I have said that? ", pos

Juan Pelota ," 7/21/2008 Listed in Who Let the Dogs Out? You've gotta give props to a man who names a coffee shop -- a *coffee shop* -- after his sole remaining, uh, pelota.  Is that ballsy, or what? Fortunately for Lance Armstrong, his family jewels were well spent on this endeavor.    Juan Pelota is attached to another retail venture of Lance's, bike shop Mellow Johnny's (Yelper Laura C., who accompanied me on my first outing to this retail duo, explained to me that ""mellow johnny"" is a takeoff on the French words for ""yellow jersey,"" ""maillot jeune."")  The coffee shop section of the place is pretty small; just a few little tables inside and a small patio outside with a few more.  In addition to coffee drinks, they also sell smoothies, sandwiches, salads, pastries, and breakfast tacos.  All of the food is made by Bess (Sandra Bullock's restaurant - this is an all-star venture).  I'm not a fan of Bess, so I was pleasantly surprised by the breakfast taco I ate there - it was buttery-rich and delicious.  I've become spoiled by the proliferation of the TacoDeli taco around town - and their addictive dona sauce - so the fact that I was happy with my Juan Pelota taco is sayin' something.  My first outing here was very nice.  Laura and I camped out on the patio for quite a while with my pup.  It was a hot day, but the patio was nicely shaded and caught a lovely breeze.  Lots of dog-lovers shop here; quite a few stopped to say hello to my furry companion.  Afterwards, we wandered through the bike store, and one of the people working there said we could bring my pup in.  Hooray for dog-friendly retail!  Since I've only been here once, I'm not quite ready to award it Yelp's version of the yellow jersey, but it definitely merits a second tour. ", pos

So particular, in fact, that when friends and family came to town for my recent nuptials, I distributed a map with the best coffee in the greater Austin area.    Juan Pelota topped the list.      These folks make a *mind blowing* cappuccino.  The team is friendly, engaging, and obsessed with making a great cup of coffee.  They actually have somewhat healthy and tasty snacks (try the taco salad or the caprese panini).  When the weather is nice they open up the garage door and bring the outside in.  They always have a lovely collection of fit cyclists roaming the grounds.  They even sell the New York Times and The Economist (!).    They also pay attention.  I've noticed that I'm not the only person whose order they have committed to memory.  I appreciate that personal touch.  It's freakishly rare.

Juan Pelota ," 5/3/2014 Yeah, this place is bomb. The baristas a B-level and ambiance is only okay. It's strange to be in such a bomb coffee joint with so much retail activity, but hey, they got the good stuff. Why is it the good stuff? Because they primarily serve Stumptown. Most gourmet Austin coffee places serve weeks old Cuvee coffee, which is a super basic, acidic, messy outfit. Stumptown is definitely the current top gourmet coffee in the States, in league with only a few others, and definitely not Cuvee. So, here's why this place is good. First, the lighting is really amazing. I could read in front of them big ol' windows all day. Second, the baristas are really nice. They're not experts like you may get in other good spots, but they're accessible and know the basics. Third, the coffee is fresh, the beans are fresh and bomb, and by the proper mixture of service and quality it is consistently great product without the hipster oppressiveness of the other places (think Houndstooth) or the prices of other spots (think Houndstooth or Thunderbird).

Fast forward to this summer...I decide to take my friend here for a delightful evening of Alta's coffee and good old fashioned board games.

The first vibe I got was that it was Alta's was a laid back--dare I say borderline ""hippie-vibe""--establishment, with a small selection of edibles alongside wine, beer, coffee, smoothies, and other drinkables.  I really didn't think I'd be impressed because I was early for the book club, I was hungry, and it all looked like rabbit food.  I was so very lucky to go for the rabbit food as it turned out.  Normally I expect when I buy a boxed salad from a refrigerated case in a place like this that they'll just hand it over and you're left to your own devices.  But the ""barista"" added a really high touch.  I left with my wine, and she said she'd bring out the salad in a few minutes.  When it arrived, it looked nothing like the lonely salad I'd seen in the display.  It was presented on a large paper plate, fully dressed and fluffed.  Ultimately, it looked as delicious as it tasted.  OK, maybe she was actually salad fluffer and not a barista.  Yes, you can now add ""salad fluffer"" to your vocabulary.  That is, if it doesn't mean something nasty in Urban Dictionary.  The only real downer of the night--and this could be a biggie--was at the time I visited, there was work going on below for what appeared to be a City of Austin retention pond or sewerage project.  Either that, or they'd just dressed the grounds with sheep manure.  I'm going to assume that, based on the gorgeous deck, this is not a persistent problem and just a fluke on the night I visited.  But it was at least a distraction, possibly more, especially if you're trying to eat.  It smelled like a septic tank had backed up.  Also the bathrooms are a bit quirky.  They're outside of the establishment, which is OK since most of the seating is outside as well.  But, in order to use them, you have to go inside to get a code first, which can be a unnecessary delay if there's a line.  I understand why they do this, with the number of runners, rowers, and vagrants in the area, but it's just a little hassle.  I guess the good side of this is that the restrooms are well-maintained and not the nightmare they could be otherwise if controls weren't in place.  Hits: - Decent views of Lady Bird Lake - Fantastic staff and service - Food is quite good - Relaxing - Spotlessly clean  Misses: - Malodorous (on my visit, at least) - Limited lighting after dark  Definitely a place to kill an hour or two and chill.

The space is beautiful and connected with other organizations, the heater was on full blast and warm on a chilly day, and they have a great selection of local goods to pick from, including energy bars, East Side Pies, chips, and Blue Bottle, as well as a few taps.  The atmosphere is quiet, and the seating inside isn't exactly meant for large groups, making it a great place to study or work. I'm sure the patio is popular on beautiful days and overlooks a portion of the river (and at the moment, some construction). The bathrooms are outside of the coffeeshop and code-protected, but tidy.  It's right next to the trail that meets you at Trinity, which will take you down to Rainey and also to the portion that will bring you over the river to the Boardwalk--a great stop before or after a ride or run. The parking lot is small, but the location didn't seem to be too busy on a Saturday afternoon. I would love to return! Cashier/counter area ", pos 
Alta’s Cafe ," 6/3/2015 2 check-ins Listed in austin. My favorite thing about this cafe is its location, overlooking the water. Two things about that:  1. That looks like a river to me. People keep referring to it as a lake, and I don't understand it because I'm 99% sure it's the Colorado River.  2. Get a new name for your river. Colorado deserves priority here because they also named their entire state after THEIR Colorado River. I don't appreciate having to specify which Colorado River I mean when I'm referring to rivers in the United States. Yes, it's all about me.  In any case, there's nothing not to like about Alta's. It's got free wi-fi, tasty smoothies (although I'm not sure if the Flu Fighter really fights the flu), pastries, Blue Bottle coffee, breakfast tacos (the Jess Special is what's good), and the aforementioned excellent view.

If you're in downtown and can walk here, it's a great place to take in some sun and watch the rowers paddling by on the water.  The first Saturday's of the month they also have live music and endless mimosas (until 2pm when we went for around $7) which was a great way to spend the first part of our day with the parents visiting.

Alta’s Cafe ," 7/13/2014 10 check-ins Love, love, love this location. I adore the whole Waller Creek Boathouse movement by having a cafe, rowing company, kayaks, etc all within one building. The sheer convenience is an absolute win.  I have to eliminate a measly star for two reasons. Their Handsome Coffee brand in obscenely bitter. Also, you can't see the bats from this part of the trail. I recognize that's not their fault, but I've been told by different employees on different days that we could see the bats from their patio. Maybe a ploy to have another glass of wine? No, actually, that was probably my own ploy.  No matter. Because with those two minor exceptions, the staff is super nice and helpful. Their cheese boards are to die for. (Trust me. I WILL die for cheese). They have a great selection of wines and beer. Happy hour specials and deals are fantastic. The location is brilliant. It's off of Trinity, but I take the Lady Bird Trail. Yes, a coffee shop, happy hour, cheese board, pastry Mecca just off of the beaten path? People could only wish for that sort of convenience.

Altas pretty much fulfills all of your Austin fantasies.

The wonderful staff was very accommodating and can recommend some of their sammich action (so many delicious options!) or try their gluten-free zucchini bread which is guilt-free oh so gooood, or go the sin-city route with one of their hot & fresh Snickerdoodles. For me, I had one of the best smoothies that has ever had the pleasure of gracing my tastebuds! I can't remember the name of it for the life of me, but it is purple, peanut buttery, and fantastically healthy & delicious!!  They also serve beer and wine, so if you don't want an endorphin rush from exercise around the Town Lake trails, you can just sit and chill overlooking town lake with a cool brewskie or a glass of fine wine.  Either way, a great way to Sunday Funday it up any day of the week!  Fair warning, parking is super scarce and all metered/street, especially on weekends! Excellent vino options! ", pos

Alta’s Cafe ," 4/19/2014 6 check-ins I have been anticipating the opening of this spot, and it is EVERYTHING I had hoped for.  It reminds me of the casual boating lake cafes in Switzerland.  You can enjoy a casual glass of wine with a meat and cheese plate out on the deck overlooking the water, or an awesome strong espresso (served correctly with sparkling water!) and a pastry.  The coffee is handsome coffee.  It is strong quality coffee, so if you don't like strong coffee, you won't like this.  The owner is super friendly and informative.  You just get your order at the counter, and then it is brought out to you when done.  The owner hand cuts the meat and prepares the plates for you.  They also have a small selection of bottled beers for those who don't like wine.  They also serve up some smoothies and tea (which I haven't tried yet).  Another bonus is that they have a wide selection of GOOD gluten free pastries brought in from some local bakeries.  The zucchini bread was delicious and moist...I couldn't believe it was gluten free.  I think I just found my new dream hang out spot.  I forgot to mention they have free WI-FI!!

This newly constructed, bright and airy space features high ceilings and large windows facing the river. There are three tables for indoor seating and about three times that on a deck facing the river. In the morning, the rowers skim past. I enjoyed a nicely made whole milk latte and a gluten free blueberry muffin. They have a menu of food labeled ""sustainably focused, locally sourced.""  (My muffin was indeed from an Austin bakery.). The wine menu features many by the glass. The music is quiet and unobtrusive, almost spa-like.  The river location is truly beautiful.

Alta’s Cafe ," 3/8/2015 I love Alta's Cafe for so many reasons. Let me break it down for you.  Coffee- They're the first coffee shop in Austin to serve Blue Bottle coffee, and it's incredible. Their cortado is, by far, the best in Austin.  Food- They source their ingredients locally (milk, veggies, chocolate, bread, you name it!) Everything is so good; they have incredible smoothies, sandwiches, quiche, and other delicious pastries.  Location- The cafe is right on Lady Bird Lake, so you can sit outside on the sprawling deck, drink your latte, read the paper, & have a gorgeous view.  Booze- They have an impressive selection of beer, wine & cider. Check out their happy hour that runs daily from 4-6pm for $1 off all beer & $2 off all wine.  Peace- This is a place that hasn't been discovered by the masses, so it's a great place to go when you want to catch up with a friend, get some work done, or read a good book.

Their is some construction going on right now on their end of the lake, so their is *some* obstruction to their otherwise five star view.  I love coming here around sunset (otherwise it can get too hot on the patio if they don't have all the umbrellas out) because you can get a direct, amazing view of the sun setting. They have a decent amount of outlets outside (which is a rarity for patios), and their seating is SO comfy. SO comfy. They have a mix of high tables to picnic tables to these cool little egg shaped chairs.  Happy hour from 5:30-7:30, 7 days a week, and it isn't difficult for friends driving to meet you up as they can park at the Mexican Am Cultural Center and walk over. Their service is also FANTASTIC! I love the guy behind the counter - once I find out his name I'll update this review - but he is the nicest. Always asks about your day and whatnot, gush.

Alta’s Cafe ," 4/11/2013 First to Review Located on the outside deck of the Waller Creek Boathouse next to the Rainey St. district, this cafe (currently open only on weekends until they get a full liquor license or something?) serves up breakfast tacos, sandwiches, coffee, tea, and wine.  (There's beer, mimosas, and other refreshments available as well.)  Exercise enthusiasts passing by on the hike and bike trail can stop by for a quick pick-me-up before continuing on their way.  There are tables and chairs set up inside the boathouse atrium and outside on the deck, and the view of the lake is gorgeous.  (It'll also improve once the city's construction for the Waller Creek outflow retention lagoon is done.)  My favorite breakfast taco is the avocado, bacon, and egg.

Alta’s Cafe ," 4/22/2014 2 check-ins Listed in Caffeine Boost, Austin Go To's As far as coffee shops are concerned, Alta's is literally a hidden gem in Austin. There's a number of great things about this place:  1. Pretty quiet, both inside and outside. Music isn't very loud indoors, and outside, there might be construction going on, but it's a calm area. 2. Aesthetically pleasing. Alta's design is clean, simple, and relaxing to the eye (I love all of the blue...). There's a great view of the lake as well (however..the construction does put a damper on that). 3. Reasonably priced coffee that's tasty. They've got a good cold brew. I'm curious as to what their pour over tastes like (done via Kalita Wave), especially with the Handsome Coffee they use from L.A. 4. I didn't get food this time, but they have a great menu! They've got a bunch of locally sourced products (i.e. Rockstar & Antonelli's) as well. 5. Plenty of seating, mostly outdoors. Great for big groups too.  Greatest con is the parking. It's paid, and there isn't a lot of it nearby. Unfortunately, this hinders me from making Alta's one of my top favorites in Austin, but it's pretty high up there. I'm definitely returning.

Alta’s Cafe ," 1/23/2015 Alta's Cafe combines all of Austin's favorite things--single origin coffee, craft beers, the lake, and for the extreme Austinite, rowing. Scenery and limited parking (thus leading to limited number of people at once) are icing on the cake. If you get here at 7AM, you might be the only one in the shop, with free parking.  As a revenue worry, the question underlying my concern is ""how will they get enough traffic to stay afloat?"" At $10 a transaction for a beverage and a snack, surely the income must be bolstered by the Rowing Center.  Their groceries, wine, and food options are reminiscent of an eclectic convenience store: East Side Pies, baked goods from assorted bakeries, and a decent wine selection.  The concept really does push the ticket--what is the most obscure place Austin could place a quality pub/coffee shop? Rowing docks, boutique bicycle shops, food trucks, inside boutique retailers... what's next? ", pos 
Alta’s Cafe ," 7/27/2015 The food here is simply okay. I ordered a bagel with cream cheese and lox.

Other times they're just disorganized and forget that you ordered a drink until you remind them. That being said, the wine and beer selection is ON POINT.

Alta’s Cafe ," 6/4/2013 1 check-in When we first walked up to Alta's, we thought it was closed.  That's what the sign inside the glass doors said, anyway.  Then we realized that we were supposed to walk around the outside of the building to the tent and order there.  Got some decent beers and a nice wine from the kid working there, who had just moved to town the previous month.  He was pleasant, and we enjoyed the view of the lake, the shade of the building, and the fresh breezes.    Supposedly, they are going to build out the interior of the building in the coming months so that Alta's has a more permanent setup.  For now, their tent seems to be working fine.

Teo ," 11/15/2016 1 check-in Did Manti Te'o open up a gelato place in Texas??  On gamedays, maybe his girlfriend runs the shop.  And maybe he rides in on his unicorn.  Catfishing jokes aside, this place is pretty cool.  It was a little bit out of the way from where we were staying, but since we went to Blacks BBQ, we were in the neighborhood.  It was a nice way to finish the good meal we had at Blacks.  Both of my daughters went with the Strawberry, while I went with the Salted Caramel and Cookies And Cream.  My choices were very good and ""reeked"" of FRESHNESS!  I'm not a fan of fruit in ice cream or gelato, but the Strawberry version was pretty good, as well.  The service could've been more enthusiastic and friendly, but it wasn't rude.  The tables were clean and there was a bunch of parking outside (although, on weekends and other peak times, it might be a little harder). Salted Caramel and Cookies And Cream ", pos 
Teo ," 10/12/2016 1 check-in Extremely tasty gelato, generous scoop sizes, and a wide variety of flavors. What more could you ask for?  I've only visited once, but after my experience, I am sure I will be returning. The staff was extremely kind and helpful, and they were really patient with letting me sample and debate over the flavors I wanted. I ended up with chocolate oreo and some stolen licks of my boyfriend's mint oreo, and was pretty thrilled with both.  They also have a good amount of sorbetto flavors, denoted  by the green handles on their scoopers. My only wish was that some of these fruity flavors really were a creamy gelato instead of an icy sorbetto, but I know most gelato shops default flavors such as lemon to sorbetto (and I still think it is a nice surprise when they don't).

Note that gelato tends to melt more quickly than ice cream -Endless flavors to choose from. Each one is so unique, intense, and incomparable -A couple sorbet flavors available as well -GENEROUS amount! Get the Medium sized cup.

Teo , 8/17/2016 Can't give full 5 stars because I have had better gelato ... but TEO taste GREAT! I got the medium size which can hold up to 3 flavors. I got double Oreo Coffee and one of the Mixed Forest Fruits. They worker that served us was very nice and let us try a lot of the flavors. I felt bad because we asked to taste almost everything! The gelato is very creamy but it was a little way too sweet. I definitely needed some water after. Price range was not too bad. Definitely recommend if you want a quick and cheap dessert. Their parking area is a little crowded.  Apparently they won a gelato contest! I thought that was pretty cool :)  I haven't tried their coffee yet. I think I would come back here and definitely get more of that mixed fruits flavor :) Medium. 3 flavors. About $4 , pos 
Teo ," 6/29/2016 8 check-ins I really really like it here- for many good reasons!  Location/ Atmosphere: Clean and casual location. It's easy for desserts locations to get sticky and dirty tables- but I've never experienced that here. Parking is always easy to find- which is rare for anywhere in Austin but that's part of what keeps bringing me back! There's plenty of seating inside, limited number outside.  Flavors: They have a lot to choose from- both dairy and sorbet! I personally really like their Lemon flavor and my sister really likes the Pineapple. She even bought a small tub of it for $10.99 to take home even though it is on the pricier side than most tubs of gelato. A lot of the flavors are a definite summer must :"")  Service: People here are kind and they're happy to let you try the flavors before you choose! My sister and I always share a Large cup (4 flavors for ~$6) and were a little disappointed when the guy behind the counter buried one of the flavors to the bottom of the cup. We had to dig our entire cup down to find it and didn't really get to enjoy all four flavors properly because it melted and got mixed in with the other three. Won't keep me from coming but when we asked him his response was a little too indifferent- I had to knock down a star.  Overall, pretty solid location. I'd check out the HEB location where they sell their delicious gelato in tubs too!

Teo ," 11/18/2016 I have a weakness for sweet things. So much so, that I think it's my favorite food in the whole world is gelato/ ice cream. I remember eating countless tubs of store bought ice cream that had fancy names, good reviews. I tried all hip and trendy places to lick my favorite treat.

Teo ," 4/27/2016 Teo oh Teo, how I wish I could love you so much more! Came here based on the raving yelp reviews, but was sadly underwhelmed. The gelato flavours we sampled and ordered were very light in flavour and didn't have the smooth texture that I've had in other gelatos. ", neutral 
Teo ," 4/13/2016 2 check-ins My favorite gelato place in Austin!  4 stars only because it breaks my wallet to come here, but the flavors are oh so good. You can ask to try anything and nobody will judge you. I usually go for some sort of variation of salted caramel/coffee/toffee/vanilla. The texture is perfect, creamy with no fatty aftertaste. Rich but not too thick. Yum! Plus they have a sign that says gelato is healthier than ice cream that will soothe your conscience even if you decide on buying the largest size.  Their coffee is not memorable: come for the gelato! ", pos 
Teo ," 4/14/2016 3 check-ins Teo has quite a few good things going for it: good selection of flavors for every palate, an ample parking lot, a spacious interior, and coffee that sounds good (haven't tried it so can't make any promises).  I got a small cup with strawberry chocolate chip and fruits of the forest, and they were delicious. The small cup looks abysmally tiny, but they fill it up well so it's enough to satisfy without feeling gluttonous. I very much enjoyed my gelato, though truth be told it's it's hard for me not to like an ice cream or gelato place. I didn't think it was as rich or thick as other gelatos I've had, not that it's necessarily a good or bad thing. It is on the pricier side though - I would say it's close to a dollar more for comparable items at most other ice cream/gelato places I've seen. I'd certainly come back to try more flavors, but not all that often so as to not break the bank! ", pos 
Teo ," 11/23/2015 1 check-in Plenty of flavors to choose from here, all of which you can try. Our server was genuine and friendly (came on the night of the 20th so shout outs to him). Decor of this place is nice and quaint. Parking wasn't too bad as there's a lot outside of the store. I really liked the fake fire place outside and sitting there was nice.  The seats were unfortunately rather dirty though, and I didn't notice it until my friend noticed my pants had these weird stains on the outside...yes, now-dried gelato, so I encourage y'all to keep the tables and seats cleaner outside.  Now, onto the taste of the gelato. I can really only compare this to Dulce Neve since their quality is around the same level.  Honey Bourbon and the Coffee Oreo thing is the way to go here...well, that was the combination recommended to us by the server. I'm sure there are more combos out there but this one was rather spot on. It tastes exactly like you would think, except the bourbon is extremely light and adds moreso of a finisher than an equal counterpart to the taste of the coffee oreo.  Now in comparison to Dulce Neve, assuming you've been there, the first thing you'll notice is that it seems that this place's gelato is a LOT less THICK. It almost made me think of it as ice cream... but of course that's a sin for gelato lovers right? ;} Personally, I still prefer Dulce Neve over this place, but I still encourage everyone to come try this place too so you can compare it yourself.  Also, the pricing did seem a tad bit more expensive here, but not that far off from Dulce Neve's.  8/10, would definitely come again. Honey bourbon coffee oreo large ", pos

Some of my favorites are their mango, mocha, and mexican vanilla.  The most disappointing part of going to Teo, is having to narrow down your selection because there is so much to choose from.  I typically get the medium size because you can get up to three flavors, creating your own gelato Neapolitan treat.  If you are also a coffee connessour, they also have an espresso machine. ", pos 
Teo ," 6/27/2015 In searching for a new ice cream spot, I came across Teo Gelato.  The staff is super friendly and will let you try as many flavors as you'd like. I ended up getting coconut nutella and peanut butter nutella (Nuts) which were to die for!!  Parking was easy and there were plenty of spots to sit.  I would agree with a few of the other reviewers in that none of the prices up on the menu board are listed which is a little odd. Customers would really appreciate having the prices posted on menus.  This might not be the newest or trendiest places, but it was cute, convenient and most importantly tasty! Coconut Nutella & Nuts ", pos

It's a tad shameful how often I walk over for a large iced coffee, but it gets me through the day! The staff has always been friendly and quick. I've had their gelato twice and it is such a treat! I'd say the bourbon vanilla and exotic fruits are my favorite. People have complained here about the price, but I think it's appropriately priced.

Teo ," 9/4/2015 1 check-in Very good coffee, fine gelato (nowhere near spectacular- go further south for the best), delicious smelling paninis, and oddly frazzled, rude staff.    Whoever was running the shop that day appeared to have 2 new staff helping out.  There was one customer inside dining and myself and 3 friends stopped in--- so, no need to be rushed or attend to the flood of customers. The 2 'new' staff members welcomed us and we began asking questions about gelato flavors.  The person in charge interrupts to ask how she can help us (strange, we're being helped) and told us to come over to her and she would help us (also strange).  The staff member helping us with flavors handed me a sample and then the person in charge stepped in to say that she gave me the wrong flavor and barked orders to the staff member that had been helping me.  The 2 staff members scurried off to complete their tasks.  It was a very strange experience.  I wish I had recorded it to get a full script of the interactions.  The shop was not busy, nothing was wrong to the customers and no one was upset, and the person in charge was publicly degrading to her staff members working that morning. '  Seems to be a good place to get coffee.  As for gelato, I wouldn't get it here unless someone I was with demanded gelato immediately and that was the only near place.  I prefer a place down south, much creamier texture and tantalizing flavor combinations.  I'd come back to try the paninins, they smelled so good. ", neutral

It's creamy, flavorful, and still manages not to be too overwhelming. It went perfectly with their peanut butter Oreo flavor, which was loaded with chocolate cookie bliss.  All of their other flavors are decent and pretty unique - Riso is a delicious rice pudding gelato, flavored with cinnamon and filled with small pieces of chewy rice (think ""Horchata"" in gelato form), Captain Crunch tastes exactly like the cereal, and Texas Whiskey & Pecans has a strong alcohol flavor, swirled with caramel and pecans.

Teo ," 9/18/2015 1 check-in Extremely friendly staff and pretty good gelato. I got a large (4 flavors), and for the price it seems you get a pretty decent amount of gelato. I chose Texican vanilla, salted caramel, bourbon vanilla, and exotic fruit. Of those, I'd say my favorite were the exotic fruit and salted caramel. Throwing the fruity flavor in was a strange mix, especially since the gelato melts after a while. If getting many flavors, I'd recommend getting some that blend together well, just in case you don't finish before it starts melting :)  I went at a peak time, Friday night. The indoor environment seems pretty loud, with or without other people present. There's a constant loud hum from some of their machinary or AC I presume. If there's at least a group or two, it gets louder with them trying to talk over the loud hum. I would recommend noise-isolating or noise-cancelling earphones/headphones if you're looking to study or do some work here.

I can never remember his name, but the Italian barista here is the absolute nicest guy ever and he is quite entertaining (and I am not gonna lie, the accento italiano just does it for me!).  My only complaint about this place is they are supposedly an espresso bar as well, but each time I have espresso here it is so hit or miss and more often than not, it is sadly a miss. So with that said, if you stick to the amazing gelato, you won't be disappointed!  They will also let you sample to your heart's content, which will give you an idea of how awesome every flavor here is!  I have also had them cater a few events and they do an excellent job!

Teo ," 8/15/2015 Came back here after a long dry spell more because of the distance and also other really good yummies popping up everywhere in Austin. Group of us ladies rushed in for some dessert in a very cold Sunday night. This place was empty but based on yelp, it wasn't closing until 10pm. So we ordered our treats. I loved my bourbon honey and texican vanilla gelato. Wish it was bigger. The cups are deceiving because they are curved inward so you think you would get more than it looked. It hit bottom way too fast especially for what they charged. Its ok though because I didnt' pay for it plus I was full from dinner but it would be nicer to have more. Other ladies seemed to like their treats and tea was tea. There was a trickle of people coming in but I did notice the guy was cleaning up and he was nice about it but the lady behind the corner yelled that it was closing time and that we need to get out. I thought her shouting was a bit much. The guy was apologetic and nice but it would be nicer if they didn't assume we had no idea. Yelp said 10pm. We felt bad for staying so long but I didn't think it warrant her acting haughty and rude. For that I gave this place a 3 stars. Otherwise the taste is there, its cute and clean and comfortable but service definitely wasn't the friendliest. Not sure if I would pick to come back here unless someone chose to and if we are again near the area. There are so many yummier places popping up everywhere.

Located directly across from Seton Hospital, 1 mile east of the MOPAC, on 38th and 1/2 St.  38th and 1/2 St can be murder during traffic and is a turn off (pun intended) to get to most shops, restaurants, and Seton along the way.  Don't go during high traffic times.  I used to bike from my place in Rosedale to the Hyde Park Gym, and would alwasy go by this place.  Unless you have alternate means of transportation (or you take Medical Pkway), wait until later in the evening.  I would recommend skipping dessert at Waterloo's or the other restaurants in the vicinity to try an espresso and ""4-6% butterfat content"" delicious gellato (ice cream is 30-40%!).  Enjoy your treats out on the patio of course (this IS Austin).  Some of my favorites: vanilla bean with salted caramel, orange vanilla (tastes like a dreamcicle), and the sorbets are great too!  Gellato can be expensive anywhere, but Teo sometimes offers discounted days.  I believe this was Tuesday.  This could have changed since I've been back.  With all the competitors slinging high fat content gellato and ice cream, remember: ""Tèo rich & creamy gelato means all the sin without the guilt!"" ", pos 
Teo ," 7/17/2015 This place is where you want to go for Gelato in this town! Usually when someone suggests getting gelato I'm thinking they are either a 'hipster' or one of those 'healthy eaters' who avoids indulgent treats... Not so at TEO. I can honestly say it is the one place I've found where I truly choose to seek out Gelato over ice cream.  It reminds me so much of what I ate internationally. So rich and creamy.  Some of my personal favorites (though it's so difficult to pick just one) are the goat cheese and cherry - it is incredible and a must try! Coffee and oreo, nuts, whiskey pecan, coconut Nutella (can you think gelato mounds bar?) - heck they're all deliciously amazing!  You won't be disappointed.  They have a nice little patio with a fireplace outside and lots of newspapers to read inside. Even a TV if there's a major sporting event (usually European, so think world cup games). Dogs are welcome. Kids are often seen here mingling among those doing business.  It's truly a neighborhood place immediately across the street from Seton Hospital.  I'm not a coffee drinker so I cannot speak to the quality of their offering in that dept. They do have hot chocolate and it is one place that serves apple cider here locally (year round). While the cider doesn't compare with cider mills' on-site cider you get in other parts of the country, it still brings back good memories. (Personally,  I'd avoid the whipped cream and carmelized topping on it because then it just tastes like a dessert drink; to me, a great cider should stand on it's own.) If you have lived where you went to apple orchards or cider mills however, you may be disappointed. It's still worth a try. Pick up a breakfast taco or two as well.  And there are always a few sandwiches available in case you are hungry. My one suggestion/wish is that they would expand ever so slightly their food menu. Sometimes I would like to get something to eat and it's not always an option especially later in the day.  But TEO is still a real gem overall. ", pos 
Teo ," 5/26/2015 I got a small iced cafe latte with almond milk for $6, however I tasted the smoothest espresso I've ever had by far! Liquid velvet and not too acidic. ", pos 
Teo ," 1/4/2015 I wish I had visited Teo before. The texture, taste and the flavors of the Gelato were amazing. I had the coffee and Oreo Gelato and it was delicious. The staff were very accommodating and warm. We tried a couple of flavors and every single one was yum! Now I know where to go when I crave dessert. (Healthy as well) ;) ", pos 
Teo ," 10/27/2014 1 check-in This place has excellent gelato - seriously. We came in last night and a friendly staff member helped us choose our flavors and offered us numerous samples. We all had something a little different, but the whiskey pecan, mango and nuts gelatos were incredibly wonderful. Next time I'm in the neighborhood, I'll certainly be stopping by! ", pos 
Teo , 10/4/2014 I discovered this place when I lived in Austin while in college.  They by far have the best gelato i've ever tasted!  I find myself always referencing back to Teo's whenever I try any other gelato and it just doesn't compare! My favorite flavor is the chocolate hazelnut! You can go here even in the winter time because they have an outdoor fireplace w/ seating area. Anyone I've ever taken here has fallen in love with the place. , pos 
Teo ," 6/21/2015 1 check-in Had the best carmel macchiato! It wasn't overpoweringly sweet like most places.  If a carmel macchiato has depth, this is what it would taste like. My family had the vanilla, nuts, chocolate and salted carmel gelato, all tasted awesome, however everyone really wanted to steal moms, she had the nuts gelato. Jake, my 3 year old, enjoying his very first vanilla bean gelato. Yummy. ", pos 
Teo ," 4/27/2014 Wow! Teo is amazing for so many reasons:  1. Gelato - first and foremost this is legit gelato! The owner told me they make their own base and are committed offering lower fat desserts. Did you know gelato is usually 50% less fat than ice cream?!  2. Flavors - They must put out over 20 flavors a day: mint oreo, rosemary chocolate, goat cheese and honey, salted caramel, and the list goes on! They are made fresh daily, so if you go later in the day there will be more options. My vegan mother was excited she could select from the many sorbetto flavors.  2. Espresso - the traditional cappuccino is addictive. I'd venture to say this is the best coffee I've had in Austin.  3. Parking - there is plenty of it!  4. Patio - partially shaded deck you can enjoy on a pleasant day. ", pos 
Teo ," 4/27/2015 Went on a Saturday evening, not a lot of people there at that point (I think we were there a little earlier than any crowds). I got ""Nuts"" (the peanut butter/Nutella one), which was really yummy, but I think my expectations were a little high - I got Nutella gelato in Rome and it was kind of life changing, so I shouldn't compare anything to that, but it's hard not to. The girl scooping the gelato also seemed really bitter about being there, or maybe she was having a bad day. We enjoyed our gelato and sitting on the patio was really nice, but honestly this place isn't going to be a first choice for dessert for me. ", pos 
Teo , 5/9/2014 1 check-in Had my first Teo experience recently after many people telling me to visit. I am loving it! Delicious!  I'm kind of curious why there isn't an additional location! I need one closer to me near West Anderson! 4 bucks and change for a cup with 2 flavors. It's a nice after dinner treat. Having strawberry always gets you bonus points too.  They have plenty of outdoor seating and a fireplace for the colder months. I'm definitely going to be checking Teo out at the World Gelato Tour coming up in Austin! , pos 
Teo ," 7/4/2013 1 check-in This place is fantastic. Both times we have gone we have had super friendly service, and fantastic gelato. The prices are really reasonable, too.

Matt & Anna have continued to make adjustments based on feedback from customers.  He studied in Italy under a wellknown Coffee guru & brought those skills, an Italian barrista , and genuine equipment back with him. They have had award-winning gelato before it was trendy. It's no surprise they have gotten the Chronicle's ""Best of"" award every year for the past 10 years. Patio & fireplace Gelato & espresso - Best of Austin for 10 years New sign ", pos

Teo ," 8/5/2013 Sometimes ice cream can be a little too rich for a hot day. That's when I like to hop over to Teo.  A small can be had for about $3.60 and you can select two flavors. That part can be tricky -- which two flavors? Latte with Hazelnut Chocolate Chip? Or Texican Vanilla with Salted Caramel?  They have lots of options, all are tasty even the Captain Crunch. It's a good place to take kids or a date on a Saturday night.  My favorite flavors are Chocolate Chip and PB & Nutella. Help yo'self! ", pos 
Teo , 6/27/2015 Coffee oreo is phenomenal! The latte chocolate chip and captain crunch are soooo good. Mocha latte served in a coffee cup is a nice touch. I finished my gelato and i am tempted to order some more! Great service too! , pos 
Teo ," 8/14/2013 1 check-in I adore this shopping center.  Inside this awesome shopping center lies TEO with its delectable gelato.   I had trouble deciding on just a couple of flavors.  They are not stingy with the samples, so I got to try nearly everything I wanted.  In the end I got the Nutella one and some chocolate, chocolate chocolate one.  I had also asked for a pistachio scoop, but the girl forgot and I didn't notice until I was well into the first scoop.  Oh well, no one is perfect. ", pos 
Teo ," 8/2/2014 1 check-in I just recently moved here and I just had Teo for the first time. I was greet nicely and the lady working there asked if I wanted to sample. I was surprised with the variety of flavors to choose from. They even had some sugar/fat free options if I decided if I wanted to cut back something. But for today I wanted full flavor. So I got the small that comes up to 2 flavors, I gotten the tiramasu and PB/Nutella. They were rich and creamy, enjoy every bite. I loved the size portion as well, I would think anything bigger would be too much for me. My girlfriend and I really enjoy eating here and they were dog friendly outside the porch. I recommend this to anyone who's up for eating sweets. ", pos

However, I didn't give a care in the world. The gelato was nice and smooth.  This plus a nice peaceful environment with heavenly A/C to rescue me from the Texas heat makes Teo a great option for a nice summer time treat! Definitely better than getting froyo! ", pos 
Teo ," 4/30/2012 1 check-in After a night of light drinking and gorging ourselves at dinner, there was just a wee bit of room for something sweet. We decided to grab some gelato at Teo's. At first, I was a bit taken aback by the teensy-weensy serving cups there. But I later realized that due to the richness, even the small is more than enough.  We had the salted caramel and also the vanilla. Both were excellent. Okay, maybe the small wasn't enough, because I actually ordered a medium. Guilty. ", pos 
Teo ," 2/12/2013 1 check-in ROTD 7/5/2013 Did you know that gelato supposedly has less fat than ice cream? Many are made with milk and not pure cream, so its less guilty to eat which means you can eat more. There, now I gave you a reason to indulge.  Gelato is always presented so beautifully, how does one resist? Teo's gelato is beautiful and hits the spot fo sho!

When my baby, When my baby smiles at me, I go to Teo...""  With all due apologies to Pablo Cruise, I dedicate this review to a cool little gelato and espresso shop just across from Seton Hospital.  Their location may not seem significant, until you find yourself staying with a family member who suddenly gets a hankering for frozen yogurt late on a Sunday afternoon.  Then, you hit the Yelp maps, and find that, although the TCBY you remembered just up the road has closed, this little espresso and gelato shop across the street will do just fine, and they're open until 10 PM.  One star boost for location, location, location and availability.  Then you actually visit and find a charming little store with very friendly staff who are patient with a first time customer who needs nothing more than a medium two-flavor serving to go with appropriate packaging.  So many flavors, so many decisions, such little cups!  But all questions were answered with a smile and to my complete satisfaction, and I was in and out in under 5 minutes.  Certainly a one star boost for customer-oriented service.  The only downside was that I didn't get to taste very much of the gelato, since it was intended for someone else.  But I did taste what stuck to the underside of the lid, and it seemed quite good.  It's hard to say I'd love to go back, since Teo is far from my home and daily travels, and since going back probably means other than fun times.  But, given the opportunity and circumstances, I'd love to give them another shot--this time, on the eating end of things. ", pos 
Teo ," 9/25/2014 1 check-in If I'm honest, I've yet to have the gelato (which by all means, is mighty tasty), but the Italian espresso I ordered was very well-made and very much in the style of Italian espresso - a true work horse that isn't overly sweet or bitter. I felt that it was served a bit on the hot side and with a bit more milk than I usually take, but overall, a solid cup of coffee. ", neutral

Teo ," 8/3/2014 This place never lets me down. The gelato is phenomenal and you can try however many flavors you need to in order to come to a decision. They recently competed in an international gelato competition, and August 13th has officially been named ""Tèo Gelato Day"" by the mayor. How much more legit do you need? ", pos 
Teo ," 3/28/2011 I like Teo's, but I find most of their flavors lackluster.  Strangely enough, the flavor that my hubby and I both liked the most was the sugar free chocolate.  It was so much richer and bolder than the regular chocolate.  The staff here is very friendly, but it isn't a favorite place of mine.  Maybe the hubby and I are too spoiled from our crazy gelato sampling in Italy. ", neutral 
Teo ," 7/10/2014 Superb Gelato in the neighborhood just north of campus, Teo is nestled among a host of hospitals and other medical facilities. While lacking the exquisite perfection of the gelato at Dolce Neve, the creamy goodness here should not be discounted. In addition their serving sizes are absolutely humongous and should be treated with caution; you've gotta really want it if you think you can take down the large serving size. As with most gelato the flavor is light and pleasant for most flavors; pairings such as salted caramel, Oreo and a peanut butter Nutella combine a rich sweetness with that light creaminess to hit most of the high notes. It's great gelato worth a stop if you are ever in the area. ", pos 
Teo ," 6/19/2014 1 check-in Tonight I tried the Oreo flavor and chocolate hazelnut... Divine. This great gelato is amongst the top 16 best in the world- truly award winning! Very clean, very friendly staff, and handmade, damn delicious gelato! Take home a pint to go! ", pos

We like to take the dogs and sit on the deck.  They even have a water dish for dogs.  I've been many times since they opened and I'm always pleased.  One suggestion:  I was there Friday, Feb. 21 at about 7pm and the very nice young woman behind the counter barked ""what?!"" at everyone in front of me in line.  She said sorry, the freezers are loud, but perhaps she could say ""excuse me?"" or ""could you repeat that?"" instead.  :) ", pos 
Teo , 12/11/2013 1 check-in Pretty cool coffee shop that serves gelato. The place isn't too big but could probably fit about 20 people sitting inside. The gelato is pretty good and the coffee ain't bad either. It's been a while since I've been here so i'll update this review next time I go but it's definitely a place I would go to again for some coffee and ice cream but not necessarily study (hard chairs and can get loud if there are several people) , pos

So we sampled a few some were hit or miss and I think it is a travesty to sell stale macarons like they did for some of the ones we got and charge as much as they did.  Also got an iced latte, it was good.  We got the following:  1- Pistachio: horrible, stale, hard, brittle, way too tough 2- Espresso creme - better, fresher good flavor, dense 3- Chocolate - awesome, fresh, melt in your mouth 4 - Strawberry - great fruity flavor, not as fresh but still not stale 5 - I think we got another coffee flavored one, it was not memorable Hit or miss Pretty box kind of fugly macarons ", neutral

We also received a free macaron with check in so we tried the salted caramel & almond. ($7 minimum purchase for the free macaron offer)  Not the best macarons I've had but the texture was still pretty soft. If you prefer your macarons with flavor but not super sweet- you should check this place out. I was pretty impressed with their cronuts because they were still moist & fluffy and again not too sweet. I would come back to try other things if I am in the area. Took a bite before I could snap a photo -_- , pos 
La Patisserie ," 2/1/2016 1 check-in The perfect place for a relaxing, Sunday afternoon. The light coming in through the windows, the soothing French sounds of Edith Piaf, and, of course, the delicate sweet treats. I couldn't have picked a better place to read Proust and meander through sentences that last longer than a French macaron.  I shall return in search of this place again, but altering my experience and I'll explain why below.  Pros: -Interior decor transports you back to a 100-year-old home with hardwood floors, white walls, and light gliding through window panes. -My first French macaron (Chocolate Chile): Soft, sweet, with a spice on the back of the tongue, all collapsing in my mouth. Much better than I ever imagined something so small could taste. -The Cronut: Cinnamon, sugar, and cream in a donut. Would definitely order this again.  Cons: -The room where the light travels into is also the children's playroom. There were no children playing on this day thankfully but I'm foreseeing future problems. -I adore Chocolate Croissants. The buttery, flaky texture sweetened by a semi-sweet chocolate filling, ah yes. Alas, this was not that. No flaky. No buttery. Dry and more like bread than the croissants I'm used to. This is what I won't be ordering next time. -This place was popular on this quiet afternoon among loud bachelerettes on some kind of tour. Luckily, the service was so fast that they used the restroom and ordered their treats in a few minutes without disturbing my afternoon reading for too long.  Also, use Yelp App & Check-In for the free Macaron. It's worth it. Chocolate chile macaron, chocolate croissant, and a cronut. ", pos

La Patisserie ," 7/18/2016 2 check-ins I wouldnt say this is the first place I think about when someone mentions donuts, but you must try a Cro Brio before you die. If it's a donut, than this may be the only place I recommend eating said donut with a knife and fork.  This place is small, cozy and very cute. They have a selectioned off area for little children to play in a separate, but attached room making the ambience very comfortable in this old house.  I enjoy the French theme and their cold brew is good. 3.50 for a small 12oz and 3.75 for a large 16oz. Just get the large. Soy and almond milk available.  Great for a quick pick up afternoon coffee, or simple date, or needing to satisfy that sweet tooth.  Next door is the ""Greetings from Austin"" tourist stop so this place does see it's fair share of tourists.  Awesome check in offer: One free macaroon. Several choices.

As far as the flavors and quality of the macaroons .. they really are the best that I have ever had. I do enjoy their other pastries too but I will never drive by this place without grabbing at least a couple of macaroons. I have tried macaroons in France, NY, and LA but these are still the best out of them all. The location is tiny so there is limited space for parking but this area is pretty friendly to pedestrians so don't worry about parking a bit down the street and taking a stroll to get here. The staff is always friendly and their presentation of the pastries is very cute and hospitable. The interior does not have that much seating but somehow manages to have a small kiddy play area in the corner of the room so they are definitely kid-friendly! I always bring out-of-towners here and also take macaroons to family who lives out of town also. That goes to show how much I love these guys and take pride in their ability to put a smile on your face. *they usually have rose and lavender if you get there before they run out - these are both really worth trying*  love love love .. love this place ", pos

I also grabbed a lavender macaron and a plain cup of the house coffee. I had the vanilla cream cinnamon sugar CroBrio and by looking at it, I thought that it was going to be way too sweet but it was perfect...literally perfect. I wouldn't change a thing!

You will probably miss it if you aren't looking carefully. It's right next to the greetings from Austin mural though, so make sure you take a picture.  I was very interested in trying the cronuts upon arrival. I saw that they were on top of the counter, looking a little saggy and depressed. I bought one to eat thinking it wouldn't be that great, but it was really good. If you have a sweet tooth like me, it had the right amount of sweetness. It was flaky and the filling inside was good too. I tried the peanut butter filling one and the vanilla bean, both which were good. But highly recommend the vanilla bean one because it's covered in cinnamon sugar.  The macarons were ok, I had the toasted almond one and it had a great taste to it. Bakery goodies!

It's that good.  I had the cronut thing. Whatever you call it. It was sublime. And? I had my very first macarons. Are they always that good? Because those were delicious.  My only gripe is the price. For a fancy donut and 2 macarons, $10 was a bit much. That said, I will be back every week. ", pos 
La Patisserie ," 1/28/2016 1 check-in Having first tried only the bread that was given to me on a food truck tour, I was so happy that I finally got around to coming here. Very limited indoor seating, especially since this was a very chilly, cloudy, yucky Saturday morning, and my friend and I ended up having to sit outside. It was difficult to decide among all of the beautiful options, but eventually we decided to split an almond macaroon, a raspberry pistachio pastry and a lemon blueberry scone. Everything was perfect and beautiful! The coffee, however, is where it fell flat for me. I ordered an almond milk latte, and while it got the job done, I would not go back for espresso beverages alone. However, I am completely smitten with this place. Raspberry pistachio pastry, almond macaroon, and a blueberry lemon scone ", pos 
La Patisserie ," 1/4/2016 Updated review Still a completely quaint place that I had been away from for far too long.  I got a mocha, delicious, still coffee. . . .Not like some of these hot chocolate tasting things that are called mochas - really nice.  I had the walnut/apple croissant - the pastry was nice but I would like more filling.    My friend had a wild berry (maybe wild strawberry?) macaroon that was really nice as well, in fact she's hooked and we're going back.  She had a peppermint mocha that she enjoyed.    Such a sweet, charming place. ", pos 
La Patisserie ," 6/27/2016 1 check-in The macarons are wonderful! Since I'd never tried them before, it was a pleasant surprise at how light and flavorful they were. Spent a nice Sunday afternoon there and it was very pleasant! Will definitely go back again! ", pos 
La Patisserie ," 4/24/2015 1 check-in The lady working the counter was really sweet and pleasant to converse with. She took the time to explain the various macarons, pastries and desserts. However, I came here around noon on a weekday and the desserts were already slim pickings. Does this mean that the desserts have already gone in the morning or does this mean that they hadn't replenished anything and the 2 cake slices left was since last night?  Anyways, the macarons here that are claimed to be amazing.. really were not. They weren't terrible, but they definitely weren't great either which leads to the 3 stars.  I am a huge fan of macarons and have tried many (all across Asia & North America) so I definitely have a preference for what texture of macarons I like (I'm sure many can agree). First off, the macarons did not taste fresh. The macarons were bigger than normal sizes. But big doesn't mean better sometimes. The texture of the shells were grainy, chunky and kinda hard to chew through. The filling, definitely there wasn't enough. The ratio for the shell vs filling was not balanced. The flavors were okay, very light and couldn't taste much. I ordered a box of 6 and had the chocolate, salted caramel, cardamon, lavender and I cant remember the rest.  So the verdict is... the macarons here are not to my liking. Box of 6 ", neutral 
La Patisserie ," 10/4/2016 Accidentally found this place while taking friends for a photo op by the Austin mural. We decided to stop for a snack. Their macaroons are seriously the best I have ever had. Perfect texture, slightly sweet, a little crunchy - absolute perfection!  They also had very good coffee. My friend had the custard filled, chocolate covered cro-nut. It was also very very good. A little ""too"" much for me, but perfect for those that love a sugar bang! ", pos 
La Patisserie ," 6/6/2015 1 check-in I had this place bookmarked on yelp and I saw the Austin mural first, parked to take picture of the mural, and notice I also stumbled upon this little macaron joint!  I came here on a late Sunday afternoon and most of the macarons flavors were already sold out. I had to settle with rose, salted caramel, and chocolate. Which all 3 were decently tasty, I just wish they had made more or I had came earlier.  The location is in a neighborhood in the corner, looks like a small house, some tables and chairs outside.  Definitely take a picture with the Austin mural! ", neutral 
La Patisserie ," 11/19/2015 1 check-in I give this place 4 start, but the Cronuts are amazing!!!...specifically the chocolate peanut butter one. It will change your life...seriously.  It's airy, light, balanced and not too sweet. The chocolate i think is dark chocolate, the peanut butter compliments but doesn't overwhelm and the filling is smooth and creamy. I also had a latte and the drink was good.  The place itself is tiny and IT NEEDS BACKGROUND MUSIC. It's clean, but charming in size:)  Overall the cronut has a great balance of each ingredient and I've been craving another one ever sense. I'd recommend going there and getting it to go. ", pos 
La Patisserie ," 7/17/2016 One of our favorite morning walkable destinations. Very good cappuccino. HOWEVER, on a very recent visit Saturday the music was over loud and obnoxious, no Edith Piaf this morning, more of a punk fusion sound. Also the padded/upholstered chair has shot springs so pretty rough on the back, needs too be taken out of service. Finally, the idea of a separate kids area is great, until..the toys provided have sirens. Not very Zen this morning. Hoping we can maintain our usual enthusiasm for this normally delightful place.

La Patisserie ," 3/17/2015 1 check-in Gotta go for the macarons! I came here just to try out their macarons but I got more than I expected. Location is next to houses and a small business strip.. The parking is behind the bakery and the lot is a bit small.  I got three macarons: Passion fruit, cademon honey and wild strawberry. The passion fruit was just ok but I that was just a random pick. The cademon and honey was pretty good, didn't really have a distinct flavor but you can taste the honey. The wild strawberry was my second favorite, this was a simple flavor.  My rating goes mostly to the texture. To me, macarons are all about texure! The shell to the inner and the filling. The shell was a bit grainy, guessing they didn't sift the flour enough.. The inner was good, not too wet and not too dry. In other words..chewy but not too crunchy.  The fillings were all good, wasn't overloaded but had enough. With a macaron the textures should be semi hard to soft to really soft. I'm no expert baker but I am a baker so I've made these before.  The cool part of my visit was the pastry happy hour! Never seen a bakery that does happy hour but it's a good idea. HH deal is half off all croissant pastries. I had the almond croissant and it was delish! The first words that came out of my mouth was oh my gosh! HH is 3pm to close to better get yourself over there before they close!  Reason #3 to visit Austin again! woo lala ", pos 
La Patisserie ," 1/3/2016 Super cute pastry shop in South Austin! My friend and I picked up a dozen macarons and coffee and we were extremely pleased with our choices. I particularly loved the lavender and the pistachio macarons but the other flavors are just as great. The place is pretty tiny, so I would be safe and make your order to go. ", pos 
La Patisserie ," 12/21/2014 1 check-in Listed in Treat yo self! Macaroons are so hard to describe to someone who has never had one before. The outsides have an eggshell like crunch, and the inside is soft and gooey like a marshmallow. There is a delicate cream filling in the center and the flavors are often soft and subtle. These two bite treats are so light and airy that you can eat a million before you even realize it. But it's ok since they are made with egg whites, meaning they have zero calories and are practically health food. ( in my mind at least ;-) )  There is a check in offer for yelpers to get 2 free mini macaroons with a $7 purchase. They were out of those when I went so they gave me one full size for free instead. Can I just say how amazing their display case is? Homemade pop tarts, lovely cakes, macaroons the colors of the rainbow, and chocolate croissants, oh my! They also make frou frou coffee drinks that look delicious.  There were no flavor signs by the macaroons but the awesome lady behind the counter took the time to list each one off for me. Some of their seasonal flavors right now include caramel apple, gingerbread, and two types of peppermint ones (I believe one with white and one with milk chocolate fillings, but not entirely sure).  For myself I chose two vanilla ones because they are my favorite, one champagne, one caramel apple, and one espresso. The champagne one blew me away. I was not expecting it to be bright pink and almost shimmery in color but it was phenomenal!! Honestly I thought they all were! I would love to come back here again for a cappuccino and a chocolate croissant. The inside is cozy and smells divine. What better gift idea than a few macaroons for the people you love most? I know it would be a gift I would be more than happy to receive!! Clockwise from top left: vanilla, espresso, caramel apple, and champagne macaroons ", pos

La Patisserie ," 4/8/2016 Have been wanting to try this place for ages now, but never get around to it. Finally grew desperate and Postmate-d the CroBrio! The chocolate glazed one with peanut butter filling. AMAZING! Such a fluffy and smooth texture, gooey peanut butter (unlike the store bought PB), and the chocolate glazing was of course delicious. Really wish I had ordered two because they're not as big as the other Yelp pictures seem to display. Also coincidentally, I got it in Happy Hour so only $2.5 instead of $5! Could easily buy one everyday without boring my taste buds. ", pos

La Patisserie ," 12/1/2014 1 check-in We stopped by this place after lunch since it was in my boyfriend's old neighborhood and his parents were wanting some coffee.  The place is an old house and very quaint inside.  I loved seeing the paintings from local artists hung on the walls and they even have a little play area for children in one of the back rooms.  We tried one of their croissant amande (almond croissant) and had macaroon that we got for free for checking in (scoreee!!!).  The macaroon was cherry and cracked black pepper flavor - I thought it was really tasty! It had a nice bite to it and it was very light and airy.  The croissant, on the other hand, was not very good.  It was cut in half and had an almond spread on it, which made the croissant soggy and dense.  The taste of the spread was good, but it did not seem to complement the croissant very well.  The croissant itself was not very flaky or crusty either, so it was kind of a disappointment.  Everything else about this place makes me want to come back and try the other baked goods, though.  I am sure this croissant thing was just a misunderstanding, but it's definitely something worth mentioning! Cherry black pepper macaron! ", neutral 
La Patisserie , 10/12/2016 I just discovered this place last week and I am absolutely infatuated with it. The food is delicious and the staff is friendly and sincere. I went in yesterday to pick up a croissant and coffee for my birthday breakfast and there was only one woman behind the counter. People kept coming in. I was absolutely impressed with the grace and politeness in how she handled being understaffed. She still managed to greet every group that came in and continued to help each person that approached the counter. Impeccable multitasking skills. That girl deserves a raise! , pos 
La Patisserie ," 11/23/2015 1 check-in This shop is a cute, chill hangout place (and it's right next to the ""Welcome to Austin"" wall!!!)! Anyway, I got 3 macarons ($2.25): salted caramel, orange honey cardamom, and pumpkin cheesecake. I liked the orange honey and pumpkin, but salted caramel was just okay. A previous review said the cookie was grainy and I totally agree. I wasn't digging that texture very much but the macarons are pretty good and pretty good size- not the best, but not disappointing. The filling to cookie ratio wasn't super noticeable.. maybe there was a little more filling..? I also got an almond croissant which was half off after 3 PM. It was also pretty average; not amazing. I ended up paying $6.25 for everything because I checked in on here and got a macaron for free plus that happy hour.  So, overall I was just satisfied. I'm not really adamant about going back but it's a cute spot, they have a good selection of cakes and whatnot, and the prices aren't bad... ", neutral

La Patisserie ," 10/4/2014 1 check-in It was alright.  The girl that helped us seemed a little apathetic, like she wasn't too thrilled to be there.  I thought this was supposed to be a nice bakery!  As for the atmosphere, I think it would be a nice place to stop and have a cup of coffee.  Looks cozy.  Had a chocolate croissant, a crobrio... they weren't fresh.  If I had an oven at home, I'd toast it and I'm sure it would've tasted ok.  But it would have been nice to try something when it's fresh.  We came late in the day.  They ran out of the macaron checkin, so they gave us the small macarons in place. ", neutral 
La Patisserie ," 6/6/2015 1 check-in My friend and I came here this morning since it was next to the Austin mural. We each ordered one macaroon. I got rose and she got vanilla.  Having just had Laduree in NYC last week I couldn't help but compare it to their delicious macaroons! Unfortunately this fell short in comparison.  The macaroon didn't taste fresh to me. The flavor was okay, but the texture of the shell was chewy in a weird way. The price is a bit steep too. $2.10 for each macaroon. That's Laduree prices but not Laduree quality. Rose macaroon.

La Patisserie ," 3/25/2015 1 check-in Listed in All About Austin Super cute bakery with an awesome barista/cashier. Love the decorations--shabby chic overstuffed armchairs and mismatched black chairs, whimsical wall art, and soft muted colors.  Tried their lavender macaron and it was one of the best I've ever had. Chewy on the outside and delightfully creamy on the inside. Love, love, love.  The cortado, espresso cut with a small amount of milk (they offer cow, almond, and soy), was delicious. And prepared with such skill and patience by the business's lovely staff.  La Patisserie has a dedicated area for kiddos to play and eat, which is nice. Helps moms and dads who are looking for a bit of serenity in a most likely busy day.  Grab a cup of jo or a box of macarons to go, or sit here and leisurely sip on your beverage while studying.  Tip: Use your Yelp app to check in to get a free macaron! ", pos 
La Patisserie ," 7/8/2014 This little pastry shop was my first macaron encounter, and I was swooning. I don't have anything to compare them too but these made me happy.  They also have a decent pan au chocolat, although not my favorite ever. My friend got the cinnamon brioche bun and she was pleased. I tried it and wished i would have gotten that instead.

La Patisserie ," 3/19/2014 2 check-ins Listed in 5 Stars, Truly Austin, FOR FOODIES... in Austin, Ambiance in Austin, Best Desserts in Austin The Crobrio was my sole reason for coming. Arrived Saturday around 11am and got the last few Crobrios left. Call ahead to make sure they have some if you live far out (so you don't make the trip for nothing). What is a crobrio?? ATX version of NYC's infamous Cronut (crossaint deep fried like a donut & stuffed with creamy custardy goodness).  I was afraid it wouldn't be good since it was sitting out & not freshly fried upon order. I was afraid it wouldn't live up to the hype & that my overpriced $5 donut would disappoint my tastebuds. But NOPE! It was delicious in taste & texture & the filling was perfect! I'm reviewing the cinnamon sugar since that's the only kind I got to try.  Check in with yelp to get 2 free mini macarons! I got the salted caramel & honestly, it's going to be on my birthday wishlist this year. I could eat a box of those! I liked the size: 2 bites! Texture was perfect! And the saltiness factor was perfect & not overdone. Will be back for more.  Also got the almond crossaint and got to try the savory crossaint (which was a huge hit amongst the 3men that we brought with us). Both did not disappoint- crispy on the outside & rich on the inside. $2-3/each.  Parking: street parking- please be considerate & don't block driveways!  Seating: a few small tables inside & 2 small tables outside (best to go with 1-2 friends)  Kid friendly- they have a small play area for infants/toddlers.  Bring cash or credit card (I THINK they have a $7 cc minimum but memory is a bit rusty)  Service: friendly, no complaints :) Baby play area Other goodies Macaron prices See all photos from Cynthia C. for La Patisserie ", pos

La Patisserie ," 1/12/2015 2 check-ins I discovered this place through a Weekly Yelp awhile back when they had featured the Cro-Brio they serve up here (it's a brioche cronut and is what baked good dreams are made of!), so when a friend and I came in on a Wed only to find that the Cro-Brios only make an appearance on the weekend, we were heartbroken. But, the amazing gal behind the counter, Megan, made our day by telling us that they have a sort of croissant happy hour where if you buy a coffee beverage after 3pm, you get a croissant pastry for free! Sold!! Their plain croissant are flaky, buttery perfection and their almond versions are exquisite! Megan also told us that we can always call beforehand and they will put some Cro-Brios aside to be picked up as they tend to sell out, especially on Sat. mornings. She even took down my info so that I would have a couple of Cro-Brios waiting for me Sat. afternoon! So super kudos to Megan for turning our frowns upside-down!  I came around 3pm on Saturday and lo and behold my Cro-Brios were ready and waiting (I had confirmed w/Kristin, the gal working on Sat, over the phone) and Kristin could not have been nicer! She even gave a full macaron in lieu of 2-mini ones per the Yelp Check-In freebie since they were sold out. I went w/lavender and it was delicious!

La Patisserie ," 8/3/2015 As soon as you walk in La Pâtisserie, you can't help but feel at home.  The bakery is small but is so cozy and charming.  We love the atmosphere of eating a wonderful pastry while sitting in one of the tables.    Been here several times now and get the crobrio each time.  It is our absolute favorite and is incredibly addicting!  When you take a bite of their crobrio,  the cinnamon sugar really enhances the pastry.  The sugary dough provides just the right sweetness,  while the custardy filling blows your mind.  The dough itself is dense,  but soft and not dry at all.  The dough is dense to complement the custard filling.  We usually buy a few to bring home and even a day or two after (it doesn't last too long at our house),  it still tastes great,  and the dough is still soft and pillowy.  The only reason I don't give this place 5 stars is because the coffee is not that great in our opinion.  We've ordered the cappuccino twice now,  and feel it tastes more like milk,  and isn't strong enough.  It's not make or break,  but a good pastry is better appreciated with good coffee.  We will still come back and just get coffee elsewhere. Crobrio is the absolute best!! ", pos

Not to mention, it's gluten-free, which really surprised me when I found out, because it tastes great.  - Lemon Blackberry Buttercream Meringue Cake.

La Patisserie ," 3/11/2014 Listed in after eats La Patisserie is a cute little house (I guess you would call this a cafe?) that has some tasty-looking pastries, but all I've tried is their macarons and their coffee.  Step one: avoid the coffee. I would rather go to Starbucks to get coffee than buy coffee here again, and even so, there are plenty of other local coffee businesses in Austin that serve better coffee. They are not known for their coffee--and with that, I just don't see the point in wasting your money on something they don't really even know how to brew. Honestly, my latte tasted like foam on top of cardboard-like coffee.  It wasn't that appetizing.  On another note, I liked the macarons! I would definitely come back for them again. The first time I came there, they were completely sold out! I came around four or five o'clock, and it was such a bummer--so just be careful of the time you go!  The second time, I got three different flavors: Sea Salt Caramel, Espresso, and S'mores. They were all a littleee on the sweet side, but I didn't mind it too much. The texture in them wasn't as soft as they should have been--they were a bit too chewy for a straight up, good macaron, but they were still good.  I would definitely come back, and next time try the cronut! I heard those were tasty. ", pos

La Patisserie has a few pastries and quiches too, but the macarons are the main attraction. This place has been in business for a few years and they know what they are doing.  If you want macarons, especially on the weekend, head here early (before noon) because they sell out fast!  The interior is intimate but tasteful. I can't think of a happier place to enjoy a sweet treat and cup of coffee or tea with a friend. ", pos 
La Patisserie ," 2/28/2015 Macarons macarons macarons! Who doesn't love macarons? At La Patisserie, they are baked to perfection with a nice crisp exterior and a chewy interior.  They cost around 2 dollars each and are decent sized.  They have a good variety too. We got the wild strawberry, matcha, and almond.  The almond was our favorite and we wish we bought more.  We were not too impressed with the matcha.  The color of the matcha frosting was a brownish/greenish and very very unattractive.  Also, the matcha flavor was too subtle for our liking.  Overall, it's a cute little place with good macrons.  You will probably find macarons you'll like, but there's nothing that really stands out about these macrons in comparison to other macaron bakeries. The store is in a house and they have limited parking behind it. If you check in on yelp, you get a free macaron which is a huge plus! ", neutral

La Patisserie ," 2/2/2015 1 check-in When I moved into the neighborhood, I was overjoyed to find this little French bakery. I tried it out to see how it compared to the baked goods I was used to eating in Dallas, and I was pleasantly surprised. Everything I've had from here has been so good! I stopped in one morning and got cinnamon rolls and ham & cheese croissants for my family and everyone raved about them.  The staff is SUPER friendly and nice, I always feel welcomed and like they're glad I'm there.  If you go in later in the day, they always have some pastries on sale! I recommend signing up for their newsletter to stay on the inside with events and special deals.  The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because I don't love the coffee - I thought it could be a little better. Ice tea is great, though. Definitely bump this place up on your list of places to check out. ", pos 
La Patisserie ," 9/6/2015 I had a crobrio and it was very good! It's not quite like a cronut but has a similar vibe.

La Patisserie ," 4/9/2013 Updated review Listed in Second breakfasts and Elevenses Still love the pastries here. But, I'm beginning to take issue with the quality of the barista. Cappuccinos are never consistent. Too hot, too cold, too light. The last time i went in and asked for a single cap, I heard the barista checking with the cashier if that meant one shot. Then I got my single cap in a giant cup (about 20 oz). Aaaaaargh! 7 oz for single, please.  On a different note, the main room is crowded with the oversized 4-top table, and the secondary room with the kid play area is only large enough for 2-3 ppl the way the seats are set up. It is going to be hard to get my family to come back here :/  They remain 4 stars for good pastries and friendly service. ", pos

La Patisserie ," 12/10/2013 Listed in Dessert: Two for me, one for you I've been on a cro nut craze ever since they became popular in NYC. I've been searching for the perfect cro nut. The ones here dubbed Cro Brio, look just like a cronut. They taste good, all though I am not sure I would forever for go donuts for one. My only downside is they're expensive. I ordered four for friends and family to try, not knowing the price. I was astonished when I found out they were $500 a piece and I had spent $20.00 on cro nut. Go here for the novelty donut, if you want to try one because they're as good as they get in Austin.  I haven't tried much of their other dessert, though they look good! ", neutral

La Patisserie ," 2/21/2015 I came for the macs. The macaron flavors were spot-on (lavender was subtle, vanilla not too sweet) but I'm giving it 3 stars because of texture. Macarons are supposed to have an eggshell-like texture on the outside, chewy and soft on the inside. These were altogether too mushy, with no crispness on the outer shell (really more like a [very expensive] whoopie pie.) Packaging was cute, atmosphere and decor are charming, with just a slight amount of welcomed kitsch. My latte was nothing special. Perhaps the macs had been sitting out for awhile, or I came on an off day; I'd be willing to try them again. (And I must add that their cakes looked absolutely gorgeous, as did their croissants. Taste review to come.) Assorted macarons in charming little boxes ", neutral

La Patisserie ," 10/28/2014 1 check-in I think I almost cried when they only had like two macarons left after I stopped in before heading back to Dallas. Lavender and pistachio are probably my favorites; followed by the vanilla.  They have phenomenal flavorful macarons. The right amount of outer crispness collapses into cakey softness, which leads to a delicious filling. The entire pastry is full of flavor. I have tasted many macarons where the pastry flavor is dull or the filling flavor gets lost.  If you're in Austin you should definitely stop in and preorder if you want to be sure you get them. (FYI - if you preorder and don't make it in when you said you were going to, make sure you call them. They will sell your macarons to desperate macaron lovers like me. :-p) ", pos

My Sweet Austin ," 10/16/2016 I contacted Sara a week before I needed a cake thinking it was too last minute. She's a total rockstar and accommodated me with a custom cake for my boyfriend's surprise birthday party! It was a very smooth and easy transaction. I sent her some pictures of the dogs and picked a flavor. When I went in to pick it up it was probably the cutest cake I've ever seen in my life. The cake was Chocolate Salted Caramel and it was absolutely delicious! Very moist and balanced in flavor, not too sweet which is perfect. The cake was such a hit people were taking home slices after the party. Thank you so much!! I can't wait to make future orders with y'all.

A perfectionist myself, I was happy to find out Sara was a perfectionist when it came to her cakes. She was very nice through the process and made sure to write down all of my ideas and thoughts for the cake.  We picked up our cake the morning of the party and were amazed at how the cake Sara made looked exactly like the picture we showed her weeks before! We received SO MANY compliments on the cake and my son loved it! :) Our cake flavors were cookies and cream and the top tier confetti---they tasted great! I couldn't have asked for anything better for my son! I'll be sending all of my friends and family to My Sweet Austin! Thanks Sara! :)  P.S. The day we ordered our cake, we tried the assortment of flavors available in cupcakes and the strawberry flavored icing is so good! It has real strawberry pieces in the icing and tastes so fresh. The coconut cupcake was also very moist and loved every bit of the coconut flakes. Both are a must if you stop by! The Nightmare Before Christmas :) ", pos

My Sweet Austin ," 10/25/2015 This bakery is very cute and small which is perfect in West campus. I actually ordered cupcakes and asked to pick up on a Sunday which is when they're usually closed. The owner never mentioned to me that she is usually closed and agreed to my pick up date. How sweet is she to compensate my pick up date! The cupcakes were good and frosting was a little lighter than the other bakeries I have tried. I think everything was great, but I only took a star off because one of my little fondant designs started bending and fell before the cupcakes got into my apartment. I had to stick a toothpick behind it to hold up that heart piece. It could be that it was a bigger heart with the word anniversary on it so it did not get to harden as fast as the other hearts. Overall Sara is a very nice person and was very patient! One of the hearts fell and I had to put a toothpick behind it to hold it in place. ", pos 
My Sweet Austin ," 3/9/2016 Dulce de leche cake was excellent. The frosting was sweet but not cloying. The sponge was moist. Everyone enjoyed the cake, children and adults alike.

Sara is very professional, we met many months in advance of the wedding, tasted the yummy cakes and came up with a mock-up of the cake. The Groom and I threw out some ideas, something nature looking and outdoorsy that also captures our personaility. Ok, yes .... that's a little bit difficult to grasp, but My Sweet Austin had not problem making the most amazing cake ever!  On ""the big day"" I was more than pleasantly surprised and everyone loved the cake. There were pictures of the cake up on Facebook before anything else at the wedding. Not only was this cake incredibly creative, it was out-of-this-world delicious!  If you're looking for a custom cake for any event, My Sweet Austin is the place to go!

I asked for the exact same estimate at another bake shop and was given a price $100 more at the other shop simply because the picture would be edible (at My Sweet Austin, she was unable to do an edible photo) but I would totally take a non-edible photo and save $100 over the other option ANY DAY.

It was truly beautiful - simple, elegant and classy.  Many of our guests commented on how lovely the cake was and just as important, how tasty it was!   The fondant was really good and the cake itself was moist and flavorful.  I've eaten a lot of wedding cakes over the years, and Sara's cake tops the list.

I came in on Sunday around 4pm so it was empty and quiet, a great time for an intimate date(: There's some seating inside as well as outside!

If you really need to wake up try Shots In The Dark, a black coffee with 2 shots of espresso.

I was having a coffee date with a few friends and we wanted to be comfortable.  We arrived to find we were the only ones out on the patio.  We arranged the couch so we had a beautiful view of the sunset while being able to enjoy each others company in a somewhat romantic fashion.    The location is inside a gas station but don't be fooled.  Go out back and enjoy the scenery on the outdoor balcony with the leather couch and small intimate tables. , pos

Anywho, the main convenience store is open until midnight, or 11? It's got quite a variety of wines and several ciders and beer. The coffee shop is open until about 7 in the summer. The outside porch doesn't really have any fans (they're really slow) but it's still a wonderful place to watch the sunset.

It was a glorious day, there are hundreds of outdoor patio options in town at which to meet, why on earth would she suggest a gas station?  Nevertheless, it was close to our home, we were fired up to meet and discuss the next steps in the rebuilding of our home/lives, and we always look forward to her company, so we ventured out.  Holy crap.  It IS the most unreal gas station / convenience store in Austin, perhaps the country.  Walk past the racks of ""like new"" golf balls and bags of pork rinds, to find a wonderfully secluded, spacious covered patio overlooking the Texas hills.  Facing west, no less, perfect for relaxing and watching the big gas ball wane.  We sat on comfy couches and chairs, almost alone the entire time, viewing plans, drawings, and schedules.  Reasonably priced glasses of wine kept appearing with regularity.    We ended up calling friends and telling them they HAD to come see this gas station.  Their reaction over the phone was much as ours had been, and likewise, upon arriving they had their ""holy crap"" moment.  Staying until the darkness had come, we decided that Tuscany at 360 needs to be on our list of sunset spots for visitors.  No more grumbling visits to that paean to excess and crap food named the Oasis.  This place is close, has a spectacular view, and the people who run it are nice.

Not only did they have coke slurpees, but the nice cashier told us about the great deck out back, and said that during football season they show the games on the television screens out there.

Tuscany At 360 ," 10/12/2008 Updated review Listed in Vertebra three sixty, Good Carma Bad Carma What I have seen here:  1.  They have their liquor license, and they are using it:  I was served a glass of wine while sitting on the back deck enjoying free wi-fi and the million dollar view.  By far the best ""bar"" that is not a bar.    2.  Gas prices are down, and this includes my favorite gas station:  1/05/09 update: 1.499 Regular 1.649 Plus 1.799 V-Power 2.199 Diesel  10/12/2008 3.199 Regular 3.359 Plus 3.499 V-Power 3.759 Diesel  3.  The large back deck with the million dollar view is a great place for large gatherings.  Seating for 34:  Boyscout troop #1234 came to listen to a presentation by their troop leaders.  About 20 boys and about 3 leaders and then 6-7 other parents. I was sitting inside watching them and i felt sorry for the gay one.  He thought he was in hog heaven.  4.  A big smile on my parent's face as they walked through the doors to the million dollar view at 9:00 at night. with a glass of wine in their hands.  and they thought we stopped for gas.  5.  A women's book club meeting (about 12) all seated around a large table and drinking wine.  What I have not seen here:  1.  Real food.  How about an Italian meal served with a glass of wine?  2.  Any semblance of respect for the original architect's design: retail has indeed taken over.  The steel metro shelving appears cheap and temporary and it is the first thing you see upon entering.  Initially, they had the front doors open to a wall fountain across the room, however, this axis has been abandoned for a metal shelf full of fig newtons and Big Jims.  3.  New signage:  Seattle's Best is going to become Austin's Best or somesuch alteration that has us embrace the local coffee shop.  Here's a toast... to Hog Heaven! ", pos 
Tuscany At 360 ," 3/28/2009 3 check-ins One of my new favorite perches to work from. If you're looking for a good latte and a cozy spot to settle in for awhile, this works. The pastries come in fresh every night, so if there's not much left you got there too late! Rolling hills view from the huge Italian-tiled deck, two large screen TVs outside, comfortable  tables and sofas. There's not much room inside for bad weather lap-topping and it doesn't have the keep-it-weird funk I crave for coffee shop inspiration, but how can you say no to this view? (see pictures) There's a drive-through if you're in a hurry, and they have wine tastings - ask to sign up and they'll send you the dates.  Update Nov 2o12: Tuscany no longer serves wine in the coffee shop or on the balcony. ", pos

Baristi: very friendly and competent, but I'm not a fan of the push-button automatic espresso machines (a la 'Bucks)  Notes: yes, it's a gas station/convenience store, but if you're looking for wonderful views of Austin hillsides and forests, with a clean workspace, this is a great choice ", pos 
Tuscany At 360 ," 7/23/2010 My first visit here involved a complicated order of an apple pie loaf, a double, espresso, and a glass of pinot.  The apple pie loaf was a bit disappointing, but the espresso and the pinot were both just fine.  The view from the back patio is stunning.  On my way out, I bought a couple scratch off lotto tickets.  I didn't win.  Truly, this is the best cafe-bar-gas station I've ever been to. ", pos

It was 5 min. before the coffee shop was closed and Billy, the barista, greeted me like I was the first customer of the day. I ask if they were still open and without hesitation he said ""Sure, what can I get you."" I ordered, ""An iced, caramel awesome caffeinated beverage."" Billy was more than happy to make it up quick and it was absolutely the best iced coffee I've ever had. As he described, it tasted like the caramel candies I used to eat as a kid.  Will go back!

Since the downturn in the economy I started making my coffee at home or occasionally stopping at McDonalds for a  McCafe Mocha (I know I know...not exactly the best espresso).  But since finding this place I'm back to my $4/day coffee...much to my husband shagrin.  Coffee/espresso is great!, yummy muffins and breakfast tacos, comfortable seating, the most splendid view from the patio ever...I just love sipping my coffee or wine while looking out over the Texas Hill Country.  Everything is great about this place!...except....  Except for the coffee lids!!!!  They crack right at the sipper before I even make it to work (less than 5min) which has caused a number of dry cleaning excursions over the past few weeks.  Other than that...loves it! ", pos

I am a Realtor by day (and tea geek/superwoman by night), so I am in a lot of different parts of town with time to kill and generally need a place to land for anywhere from 30 minutes to several hours in between appointments.  Imagine my surprise when I pulled up Yelp on my iPhone and saw an interesting coffee shop location right next to a gas station? Yes. A gas station. The coffee shop portion of the gas station is managed by Texenza Coffee. So if you are familiar with them, you know what to expect.  Views; amazing. Tea; fine. Snacks; great. Patio; awesome. Wifi; fast. And they serve wine! This is a place I am going to have to come back to just to relax and enjoy the view. ", pos

I am not just talking about a few select bottles at $4.99, they have a broad selection. It is quite convenient. There is even a great patio you can sit and enjoy your wine!

Tuscany At 360 ," 10/8/2008 All hail the fancy faux-Italianate new gas station at 360 and Westlake!    As befits its Westlake location, this gas station is pretty ritzy, all stone and arches, and comes complete with drive-through coffee.  But if you're not in a hurry, it's worth getting out of your Escalade to check out the coffee bar inside.    First of all, there is a huge fish tank in the coffee area which contains some of the biggest, coolest looking sea anemones I've ever seen.  (I love sea anemones.) Second, there is a huge covered porch out back , complete with tables, chairs and sofas, that has a wonderful birds-eye view of the hill country.  When I was there before 8am, there were only a few people out on the porch, but I was told by a friend who stopped by at around 2:30pm on a weekday afternoon that the place was packed with professional people on laptops and having business meetings.  I would give this place more stars, but was pretty disappointed in the food selection.  The coffee bar had just a few standard boring pastries, wrapped sandwiches and sad looking salads in the cooler.  The breakfast tacos are horrible - dry and tasteless - and if you don't want cheese on them, you're out of luck.  Plus, the only salsa available is that runny ketchup-like liquid that comes in squeeze packets.  Think Taco Bell.  When I despondently asked for four packets, the clerk said - ""Wow, you sure like things spicy!""  Where is he from - Mars?   That crap is heresy in Austin.  Never again.  As for the non-coffee bar parts of the space, it's pretty standard gas station fare, with perhaps a slightly bigger emphasis on wine, feminine products and boxed prepared foods than average.  The rest is what you'd expect - beer, soft drinks, hot dogs on rollers, etc.  Gas is actually not too overpriced.  Surprise.  Worth rolling in if you are in the area and need caffeine. ", neutral

I stumbled into Tuscany, and it looked pretty amazing. I was only there for a quick in and out (use the bathroom, get a tea), but was thoroughly impressed. I would definitely go back if I lived anywhere near the 360 area. I was a little surprised to see a cafe inside, and completely did not know there was also a patio. Best convenience store ever.

Tuscany At 360 ," 10/4/2009 first off...we've needed a gas station off 360 between Bee Cave and 183 for a LOOOOOONG time...thank goodness this one finally showed up last year...  second...yowza what a fancy looking gas station...  So, the real reason for reviewing this spot is the lovely cafe/patio area where you can sit and sip a beverage from the Texenza Coffee bar located within.  They have coffee, wine, and beer selections.  There's a nice indoor sitting area, but the real winner is the outdoor covered patio area with a gorgeous view.  Pictures just don't do it justice.  There are plenty of tables & chairs, 2 couches, and 2 flat screen tvs and the decor is simple but dignified.  It's a great spot to stop and smell the roses - seriously the view just makes you happy.

The place is always packed on the weekends. Have I ever eaten inside of Cafe Java? No, absolutely not. Why would I wait in line, wait for a table, wait for an order to go in, then be cooked? Nope. 100 percent nope.  I call ahead. Order whatever I want from bed. Have a cup of coffee and then roll around the corner and walk right in, pick up my bag, pay and boom. Done, breakfast time.  The food is solid simple breakfast classics. The hash browns are browned up nice. The eggs, on point. The bacon crispy AF. French Toast, as you'd except. None of the items are Austin hipster fancy, but dammit they're good.  If you live in the area, order ahead, pick up, and enjoy! ", pos

I looked at Yelp and this place was packed with reviews.  Once you go in, it's not hard to see why.  The lady manning the front was knowledgeable, quick, and able to point me the right direction.  Loved their freshly brewed coffee with a shot of espresso - when you can drink it black and be enthralled, you know it's good.  She also raved about their special - which was juicy pulled pork and cornbread, served with a side of hashed browns.  I decided to go for that and a few of their breakfast tacos - chorizo, bacon.   I definitely enjoyed the tacos, they know how to do breakfast. The pulled pork was marinated, tender, juicy, something that just melted in my mouth and formed a great contrast to the cornbread.  Hash brown was lightly crispy on the top and yet a very fresh potato taste.  Great customer service, attractive specials, and go-to breakfast/lunch options will put this on my list of bookmarks to re-try.  #Yelp100challenge Pulled pork cornbread over potatoes Sumatra Breakfast tacos with bacon See all photos from Steve L. for Café Java ", pos

I stopped by once for a coffee (Iced Latte to be exact) and today I came with a friend and ordered a Mocha Latte and pancakes with chocolate chips and strawberries on it. Both were delicious.  I really want to order something else next time (maybe veggie tacos?) but I'm giving it 5 stars due to the quality of food and very friendly service. It's also so cute and cozy inside.

You may have to wait in line for breakfast on the weekend or lunch rush during the weekdays - but don't let that stop you from trying this place out. The wait does not take long and there is seating outside and they come and find you when your table is ready.   Stay and try it out - I guarantee you will be coming back for more.

Café Java ," 7/8/2016 Cute little place that can get crowded esp during brunch/lunch rushes but popular place to hit for some good breakfast food and sandwiches! When its not that crowded, its a nice little coffee shop kind of place.  Knocking off a star just because although as kind as they can be, waitstaff gets impatient here. I know it's busy but if paying customers wanna talk, then it would be nice to not stop by the table every few seconds to refill water, ask if we need anything else, take away plates etc Its a bit obvious that they want us out. We were almost done anyways but in deep convo so needed a sec more .  But hash browns are crispy and omelette light but not wow wow but a solid good. Popular place and nearby so most likely will cone back just expect crowds n wait in this small place and busy waitresses.  Oh btw yes my friend said her coffee was delicious and price is fair.

Not pretentious, friendly staff, amazing food. Best hash browns in the universe. Usually super packed so you'll have to wait a bit, but it is definitely worth it.

Café Java , 12/1/2016 Updated review I am a big breakfast fan - more traditional and less breakfast taco so I have been going to both Kirby Lane and Cafe Java regularly now for the last few years.  Lately it has been more Cafe Java as the Kirby Lane I want to has been inconsistent as of late and the regular employees I got to know being moved to other newer locations.  As others note more than likely you will have to wait as there is usually a line but the breakfast is solid.  Good bacon which is always key and the Cafe Java special is crazy good for value.

New York boyfriend was also very impressed with the decor and food, and thats saying something. The French Toast, Migas, Huevos Rancheros - I'm yet to order something I'm disappointed by.

Café Java ," 11/3/2016 My absolute favorite breakfast place (maybe event restaurant) in Austin. I love this place because it's not fancy in any way, nor does it aim to be. In fact, it's something of the opposite:  very fast paced, kinda loud, a little crowded, etc.  But Cafe Java seems to just ""get it.""  And they consistently get it. Every time.  I liken them to, like, Creedence Clearwater Revival. They aren't necessarily doing anything new, but what they do, they do flawlessly.

Café Java ," 4/24/2016 A happy and cozy place to go with your family and friends for brunch. Their food is solid--nothing crazily amazing, but definitely above average. I believe you can only make reservations on parties of 7 or more, so be prepared to wait (although definitely worth it) if you're coming in on a weekend during brunch hours. I don't live near either locations, but it's worth the drive to have a relaxing brunch with old pals.  Their coffee is so yummy! I don't often drink coffee so I'm not coffee expert, but the ""Whole Lotta Love"" Latte is a restaurant favorite (and mine, as well). I've tried a lot of different items, from pancakes to hash browns to omelets to soft tacos, etc. Everything there will satisfy you for sure, but their hash browns are where it's at. They're amazing and definitely worth the carbs. Don't expect to eat a fancy brunch with exquisite flavors or beautiful food presentation, because that's not what this place is meant for. This is your neighborhood / family-friendly version of ihop, except better in every way. Your waiters will take care of you, and the food and coffee will make your dining experience one that makes you feel at-home.

We arrived on a Sunday at around 10 AM. It was PACKED! This place is super popular. There's not much of a waiting area, so be ready to rub elbows with strangers (literally).  The food was really good. Service was just OK. Everyone seemed kind of stressed out since it was so busy. It was also raining that morning, meaning no one wanted to wait outside. And our server seemed slightly annoyed that we didn't know what we wanted to order the second we sat down.  Overall, I'd try it again if I were in that area.

Once we got inside we were seated at a booth with plenty of room and were helped immediately. The staff was super friendly and helpful.  I ordered the egg sandwich with eggs over medium, and it was delicious! I was not disappointed at all. There was plenty of cheese and mayo to go along with the eggs and veggies, so it had a lot of flavor without being overpowering. The hash browns, though...they were amazing. They are super fresh and cooked well.  I had their regular house drip coffee and it was very good! It definitely hit the spot, and they were not shy about refills.

Café Java ," 8/1/2016 1 check-in Came here for breakfast with my family on a Sunday at 9:30am and it was packed beyond belief. I thought the wait would be crazy but honestly it went quickly. Even we finished within 20-30 minutes! The service was very hospitable and everyone was very kind and welcoming.  Let's get to the food. My group has the corn beef hash, ironman, short stack, and French toast.  Corn beef hash comes with hash browns, eggs and toast. (4/5 rating) must try, it was very yummy and hearty  Ironman is a veggie filled omelet that comes with hash browns and toast. (4/5 rating) my mom loved this it was filled with veggies, bacon, and cheese!  Short stack of pancakes (3/5 rating) it was tasty pancakes but nothing too special  French toast (3.5 rating) my sister liked them but they're not to die for or anything.  Nevertheless, their food is yummy and their ambience and friendly and definitely worth the visit!  The reason it isn't a 4 star is because honestly their food is yummy but it's nothing I haven't had else where. But check it out yourself, maybe you'll find something that'll change my mind!

Café Java ," 3/1/2016 Delicious, high-quality American breakfast foods for cheap!! Latte & coffee are to die for. Also they have daily specials that are oftentimes always worth it. But let me tell you about how I perceived the place, physically. I will go into explicit detail.  I can imagine Cafe Java as the ""alt-rock"" sister of the classic Texas diner; replete with (very cheap) comfort food breakfast choices, families and members of the local community, all congregating for a simple yet legitimately delicious & fulfilling meal.  Stepping inside this restaurant will make you feel as if you were just transported to one those late-90's sitcoms. This cute little piece of heaven is a little eccentric without being pretentious, very homey and full of great people. Everything..I mean everything is perfect in here... from the size of the locale, to the inside temperature, noise level, scents & lighting.  The BEST quality & most valuable asset of this establishment lies in the unbelievably wonderful customer service. There have been more than a handful of times that I solely come to have breakfast here because I'm having a not-very-good day and the servers/staff will immediately cheer me up-- I swear to God this place has the sweetest servers I have ever had the pleasure of meeting.  Cafe Java is a good distance away from the noisy and over-animated downtown area of Austin, and that makes it a truly special place.  Its location is so concealed that their (very understated) front sign humbly hides behind a tree. I overheard one patron express how this diner doesn't need the extensive marketing & inexcusable overpricing of items other business have to rely on, in order to stay afloat. The number of regulars (who have been living in the neighborhood for years) and ACC students are  enough to keep this place busy and operating.  Finding employees as lovely and attentive is rare in our city nowadays; the people who frequent this cafe are part of a generation of Texan urbanites who still hold Southern values with the stylish edge that made Austin attractive in the first place. Cafe Java feels a microcosm in itself-- like time stopped and you are stepping into a virgin, pre-gentrification, beautiful and authentic Austin. Latte ", pos 
Café Java ," 3/14/2016 My boyfriend was coming to town and he was staying at a hotel near the area and I didn't want to go to far for breakfast so I went on a Yelp search a found this place! I go to the ACC campus near by and I had no idea this restaurant was so close to campus! I will definitely be coming by here more often.    We got there around 9AM and was seated immediately. It was semi crowded. It is a little bit hot inside so I would recommend a tee and a light jacket. The service was fast and quick. With it being so busy, I thought it was going to take a while for our food, but it came out fairly quick! (I'm impressed). I got the California omelet with fruits while he got french toast+bacon+scrambled eggs. I remembered him complementing the bacon, it was cooked just right!    Overall, we had a great experience and I will look forward to coming back! California omelet and french toast+bacon+scrambled eggs! ", pos 
Café Java ," 4/10/2016 1 check-in I visited Cafe Java on a Wednesday around 12-1 pm. The place was a bit crowded, but it was mostly because people were paying near the front entrance. We walked in and just sat wherever we wanted, and then a waitress quickly accommodated us and handed our menus.  I ordered the Soft Beef Tacos without cheese or rice and substituted avocado instead. The tacos were stuffed and filling, but I wouldn't say that they were anything extraordinary. They were decent imo.  The restrooms were pretty weird. I had to go through a door that would lead to a hall with more doors. They were single stalls, and there were two doors. One was for men and one was unisex. It would have been nice to have one for women.  The customer service was good; the waitress was polite and the workers seemed friendly. I'm not itching to return, but if I do, I would want to try one of the more popular items on the menu. Entrance Booths and tables See all photos from Crystal N. for Café Java ", pos

Café Java ," 8/16/2015 Updated review 7 check-ins Cafe Java part 2!  This time I ordered the Ribeye Platter, which is already a ton of food.  But since it's Cafe Java, I HAD to get a pancake on the side.  This is my post-workout meal; I'm justified, right?  This ribeye steak.  How can this small breakfast place cook a steak better than many steakhouses and bars???  Although their ribeye isn't as thick, it was cooked a perfect medium-rare.  An abundant marbling of fat and the steak grease that we all secretly love.  I'm talking about 70:30 ratio of meat to fat.  Every bite was just amazing.  I seriously may never order anything else.  When it comes to breakfast, Cafe Java is truth.  Eggs were cooked perfectly and their pancakes are still the bomb. Ribeye platter (toast not pictured) ", pos

Café Java ," 6/27/2015 4 check-ins I have a strange feeling this neighborhood cafe is going to be my hangout while I attend a class at ACC Northridge Campus during the summer. I'm glad they have something like this close by. Not that expensive and the food is good. I ordered a bacon-cheeseburger with potato salad and it was good. The service made me feel like I was one of the people that frequent the spot. That mattered a lot because it made me feel at ease while be in the restaurant that is low lit.  They are in the same mini-mall as the pizza spot, dount shop and a gas station which apparently they also have a cafe too. At least, I know Cafe Java is close by ACC just in case I need a caffeine fix or a meal before class. Sometimes I need a meal and not a bunch of snacks to get me through class.

Café Java ," 5/21/2016 I had been here before and always had good experiences. But it doesn't get any better than what happened yesterday. My boyfriend wanted to go out for breakfast which sounded like a great idea, but I REALLY didn't have time. I had an appointment and the window was shrinking by the minute. We were both starving though, so we made the 12 minute drive to Cafe Java. Unexpectedly, the parking lot was almost full (10:45 am on a Friday). I started to worry. ""This was a bad idea,"" I said, ""I'm going to be late.""  We walked inside. All tables were full.  I put my pseudonym down on the list (just something I like to have fun with). We were next in line for a table. I was trying not to fidget and trying not to look impatient or think about the minutes ticking by. Miraculously, two tables were soon vacated and we were seated at a nice booth immediately after it was cleared by the efficient hostess.  We ordered coffee and looked at the menu. I'm trying to guess which items might be faster to prepare. The server comes back with the coffee and takes our order.  Breakfast sandwich for him, migas for me, both with hashbrowns and OJ.  I swear I was barely finished stirring cream and sugar into my coffee, when our food arrived. This place is magic.  My partner says, ""I think these are probably the best hashbrowns I've had in my life."" ""I know!"" I reply, ""And I don't even LIKE hashbrowns!"" ""Me either!""  When she came to check on us she also brought the bill without us even having to ask. He went and paid while I chugged the rest of my orange juice. Also, you can get any size refill of your ($1.85) Bottomless Coffee  TO-GO!  I made it to my appointment. This was a topic of conversation all day. ", pos

It's such a nice little tucked away place that's also super cozy.  The staff here is always beyond friendly and super personable.  I honestly haven't ventured the menu too much.  My go to is the spinach salad.  After the first time here, I quickly realized why people love it so much.  They have a large, fun menu and the food is always on point.  I don't think they're reinventing the culinary wheel so much but you're getting good food at a great bargain. ", pos 
Café Java ," 10/7/2015 ROTD 4/9/2016 Some of the best hash browns you can get in Austin.  If you're looking for simple, well-prepared breakfast food - Cafe Java is your spot! I would say the breakfast offerings here are a bit more traditional than Kerbey or Magnolia, but amazing. I feel like this is one of the few places all of my picky friends can agree on! They're so good at over easy eggs, crispy bacon, and biscuits and gravy - my personal faves (other than the aforementioned hash browns).    Be prepared to wait a long time to get in if you come by peak breakfast/lunch hours. But the wait isn't surprising given their great service, great prices, great coffee, and great hash browns. I hope they're able to expand the restaurant soon to deal with the ever growing number of patrons wanting to get in! ", pos

Café Java ," 3/16/2016 1 check-in One of my favorite local places for breakfast.  It's always hopping, so be prepared to have a short wait in normal weekday hours and really long wait for weekday lunch and all day on weekends- they do have counter service if you are dining alone or with 1-2 others.  I've only had a few items from the lunch/dinner menu, since I usually order from the breakfast menu, but everything I have ordered has been delicious.  The servers are great and are a big part of what makes this such a popular place.  Good coffee!!

The pancakes weren't phenomenal, but they were still good. There was plenty of syrup, but I was missing butter, but it wasn't a big deal. They might have put it on the pancake and it melted, I'm not sure. I absolutely loved their queso and can't wait to try more from this place!

Café Java ," 4/9/2016 The only ""bad"" thing I have to say about this place is that they are always SO PACKED. But that's great for them!  This hidden gem... oh man, what can't I say about them?!  - The service is great. They are so friendly and really attentive! Every single person there treats you like you're their best friend. - The food is not trying to be fancy or modern. It's your typical breakfast joint / diner, but so delicious. I'd rather go here than some of the other breakfast diners :P (Some other reviewers have mentioned these other places). I always try to get something different when I come here, but I always gravitate towards the omelets. They are HUGE! And comes with a (generous) side of hash browns usually. - They have daily specials, which are actually pretty different from the menu items. I've gotten a daily special once or twice because it just sounded REALLY good. And it was! The daily specials are a bit more adventurous.  Highly recommend going here if you have a chance, but expect to wait a while if you're going on Saturday or Sunday morning. Usually about 30-45 minutes on average.  One time, I came here around 8AM on a weekday for a to-go cappuccino, and it was already pretty poppin. So make sure you have some time to spare if you're coming here for some breakfast. ", pos

Café Java ," 6/1/2016 Updated review 1 check-in Food hit the spot, really nice homey feel inside with colorful artwork. Waitress dropped the ball by not mentioning the board with specials, but maybe she thought It wasn't my first time. So check the board or ask, might affect your choice. I went with the country omelet. Descent omelet, but when it said ""potatoes and sausage,"" I was envisioning nice pieces, not the sprinkling of ground pork they used. And for the potatoes I imagined nice chopped, roasted, and seasoned, not the SAME hash browns that come with the plate! I know its still technically a potato, but come on Cafe Java! Its about variety! All in all, satisfying meal, but I know they can do better.  Update: upping my rating. went the 2nd time and waitress pointed out specials.

They have awesome daily specials and the coffee is sooooo good. What I love about this place is the staff. I feel like they are all one big family, feeding me breakfast at home. They are so friendly and I don't actually ever know who my server is because everyone pitches in an helps with every table. I have to admit I have never eaten anything but the breakfast items, but I am sure the rest of the menu is great. Of course there is always a wait when I get there, but that is because the place is small and the food is exceptional. They offer self-serve coffee while you wait. ", pos 
Café Java ," 5/11/2015 7 check-ins Busy! almost always - be prepared  to wait on the weekends.  Free wifi Excellent coffee and espresso beverages coffee for sale, whole bean home made baked goods and desserts  Great service, most the time.  I've only eaten there for lunch and breakfast, but they are open some nights for dinner.  Well known for their migas, refried beans and ranchero sauce.  My fav taco here is potato (hashbrown shreds!), cheese, beans and bacon w/ a side of ranchero.  I want to eat that ranchero sauce on just about everything. the hamburger omelet is just what it sounds like and so good.    Also, they have peanut butter syrup, so I often get a chocolate peanut butter mocha - so freaking good. ", pos

Café Java , 12/21/2015 I went here with a co worker looking for a cafe to do some work. The name is a little misleading in my opinion. The eggs were flying and a waitress called me honey with minutes of my arrival.  All signs pointed to a full on diner situation. I holstered my laptop and ordered some pancakes. Not disappointed at all. , pos 
Café Java ," 12/28/2014 1 check-in I'm honestly not a breakfast person with the whole pancake and eggs in the morning. Why not, I'm in Texas visiting.  PACKED! Right when you walk in you have to sign in and wait. I waited around I believe 25 minutes and finally I got to sit down and order.  We ordered:  Country special. Came with two eggs, two sausage patties, 4 biscuits w/ gravy, and hash browns. EVERYTHING WAS BOMB. The biscuits were fluffy and soft woth the creamy gravy. The sausages were chewy and perfectly salty. The best were the crispy brown hash browns.  The ultimate migas was pretty good. It probably could of came with a little more but  what do you expect paying only 8 bucks for a full breakfast!  We also ordered a pancake that was delish and fluffy! This one pancake was pretty big and was shared between two people just fine.  Total only came out to $24! All worth every penny! ", pos 
Café Java ," 5/29/2016 Went there with a friend because they showed up when I did a search for Cajun. Very disappointed. One item on the menu doesn't qualify. Service was excellent, very friendly and welcoming. Food was neither good nor bad. Coffee (their regular roast dark) was the same as the food. They are next door to ACC and obviously survive on that. Not worth a special trip for adults. ", neutral 
Café Java ," 12/19/2015 Went here yesterday with my bestie who was in town for the Star Wars opening,  We had breakfast, and both loved it.  I got the Java (2 eggs, bacon, toast, and more hashbrowns than any one person needs, and tea for $6.74) and bestie chose the Ironman omelet (7.99) - he said it's the best looking omelet he's ever seen, and he loved the taste, too.  Great quality food, friendly if somewhat harried staff, and busy even at 10 am on a Friday morning.  We had about a 10 minute wait for a table - not bad at all.  I've been before, and I'm certain to return. ", pos

Russell’s Bakery ," 4/23/2016 1 check-in Russell's is one of my favorite bakeries in Austin, and has been for years. I love this place, and this review is definitely overdue. Here are some of the reasons that I'm a big fan.  * Russell's provided the food for my baby shower, and I couldn't have been more pleased. The themed cookies, cake and treats (small sandwiches, scones and petit fours) were delicious, and they couldn't have been cuter.  * They have the best croissants - savory (I love the ham and cheese), sweet (chocolate, and OMG - strawberry cream cheese) and of course plain.  * This is a game changer for me ... the Italian sodas. Maybe Italian sodas are not a southern thing, but they are so often left off of the menu at Austin coffee shops. When I was pregnant, Italian sodas were one of my major cravings, and it was hard to seek out a decent one. Some coffee shops don't add cream, some use cheap syrup (which totally ruins the soda) ... Russell's Italian sodas are seriously perfect.  * The people - locally owned and operated, and the staff is very sweet. My friend and I were just in this morning, and the baristas could not have been nicer (it was really busy too!)  * Pumpkin! Like pretty much all suburban girls, I have a special place in my heart for pumpkin flavored anything. Russell's has the best pumpkin bread and pumpkin muffins ... and get this, they have them year round. Elephant cookies. We were so impressed by the adorable (and delicious) cake, cookies and tea party treats that Russell's made for my tea party baby shower. ", pos 
Russell’s Bakery ," 11/9/2016 The staff there 30 minutes before close were very friendly and helpful when I stopped in on a raining night to pick up some pastries and a hot chai tea. Ambiance, service, pastries and chai were all winners. I look forward to visiting again. ", pos 
Russell’s Bakery ," 9/17/2016 I realized Wednesday afternoon that I wouldn't have time to make my daughter's (gluten free) birthday cake in time for her party on Friday. I thought I was ordering too late but they said they would try. All we told them was the party was a Fiesta theme and asked for some colorful flowers.  We had the cake in time for when her friends arrived at 4:30 pm Friday and it was better than we could have ever imagined! We are so grateful to Russell's for making her day special. Russell's went above and beyond on the cake we ordered! Top of Fiesta cake Russell's did a great job on this ""Fiesta"" birthday cake for our 12 year old! ", pos 
Russell’s Bakery , 5/15/2016 Coconut Cake is Awesome! Best I have ever had in Austin. I drew a picture of what I had in mind and Russell gave me a call for clarification. It turned out better than I could of imagined. He combined a coconut cake with chocolate Grenache cake. It was magnificent!! Everyone at the party raved about it & lots of people wanted to take a slice home. Coconut cake layered on chocolate Grenache with chocolate covered strawberries! Amazing!!! , pos 
Russell’s Bakery ," 2/27/2016 1 check-in I pass this place everyday to pick up the kids I nanny for school.  I stopped in one time, I plan on stopping in a lot more but the first time I wasn't sold. The only reason I wasn't sold was because of a girl working behind the counter. She seemed rude and I'm pretty sure she gave me decaf coffee. BUT that's not stopping me from returning. Russell's has all of these amazing looking goodies and treats that you cannot say no to. Props to the baker Bc they do such a great job!  Russell's, I will be back.

Also, we are Anderson's coffee die-hards, and Russell's is quickly phasing them out, which just seems like a bad move. ", neutral

Russell’s Bakery ," 12/13/2015 Russell's is good. Not great, but good. I went here mainly in search of an excellent blueberry muffin, having heard that they make some of the best right there. It was satisfying, but not at all what I'd hoped for. The muffin top was like a giant square block, and didn't have the crispy golden exterior I'm used to seeing on my favorite muffins elsewhere. It just looked unusual. Also not a fan of the crystallized sugar on top, which as I recall this place does. The blueberries were still juicy and pleasant though, and the inside was crumbly and sweet, so I was content for the moment. Also had a tuna sandwich that was unremarkable. Just a mediocre tuna sandwich really.  When I went back craving another blueberry muffin, it was very dry and didn't taste as good. With several other excellent bakeries to choose from, I'm not sure how likely it is I'll go back to Russell's. Chances are they have some other baked goods that are worth trying though. ", neutral 
Russell’s Bakery ," 10/7/2015 Meh is about all I can give this place.  The parking sitch is challenging, not enough spaces.  Cute place, nice and clean, pretty display.  I went in to pick up some sweets for me and a few friends to sample.  Grabbed a key lime tart, a brownie and a couple of their iced longhorn cookies.  The brownie was okay, the tart was not very flavorful and the cookies has the thinnest layer of icing I've ever seen on a cookie.  The cookie was alright, but just wasn't up to my standards and especially for what I paid for all of it.  I don't think I will go out of my way to go back, but it's good to know its there.

Russell’s Bakery ," 9/25/2014 2 check-ins Listed in In Search of Fantastic Coffee I rather enjoyed my visit here today, coming in with a seasoned guest, a friend that recommended we meet here. I chose a honey-cinnamon-almond croissant and a mocha, while she chose a cookie and some tea.  The ordering process was warm and welcoming - a very nice man chatted with us about our day and other pleasantries. We sat down at a nice table in the middle of the bakery. It's quaint with interesting photography for sale, lining the room. My croissant was very good, although slightly dry. My mocha was also very good. My friend has said on several occasions that they have the best cookies.  Parking seemed a little bit limited, although I did find a spot right up front right before the lunch rush. All in all, I can definitely say I'd like to come back to Russell's and try some of their sandwiches, soups and other pastries. Four stars! ", pos 
Russell’s Bakery ," 12/3/2014 I discovered Russell's pastries when visiting with a friend at a coffee shop called Epoch on Anderson Lane. The Schnecken I sampled was not your ordinary pastry! It was chocked full of nuts and dried fruit, and the pastry itself was very flavorful. Subsequently, I stopped by Russell's to obtain a few pastries for breakfast during the week, and each of those was also quite delicious. I was also happy to discover one can buy Anderson's Coffee at Russell's (a longtime favorite brand), and I have enjoyed seeing work by local artists on display (and for sale).  Responding to Russell's: ""Yes, now that I've found you, I'll definitely be back!"" ", pos 
Russell’s Bakery ," 5/15/2015 Hello, I love this bakery and every time I drive by it I look for it. I really love their sugar cookies. The problem for me I do not make a lot of money and I can never buy them. I know for some people they are at a good price but I am not a rich person. Don't get me wrong I am by no way saying they are doing anything bad, I just personally myself can not afford it sometimes. Like now, I am really craving a couple of cookies but can't get them because I can't buy them. Thanks P.S. everything is good here! ", pos 
Russell’s Bakery , 12/2/2015 Love their banana nut bread as well as some of the other baked goods I have tried however good customer service with a smile is paramount to me and I have almost never really felt welcomed when I have gone into this establishment. I have been waited on by an older lady and then recently by a variation of some younger men. The men were somewhat more pleasant but still provided nothing close to what I consider good customer service. It has been enough of a turn off that the above average wares no longer entice me back there which is a pity because they are one of the closest eateries to where I reside. , neutral 
Russell’s Bakery , 4/20/2015 1 check-in The croissants were okay. They were a lot more dense than what I'm used to and they weren't very flaky. I had a ham and cheese croissant and couldn't finish it. The  cookies are pretty standard. Nothing to write home (or a review) about. , neutral 
Russell’s Bakery , 5/2/2015 1 check-in Great coffee and cream sodas!!  I could have done without the key lime tart due to it having somewhat of a refrigerator taste.  Didn't enjoy the dessert.  The apple fritter was good though.  I'll be back for coffee and fun drinks for sure! , neutral 
Russell’s Bakery ," 8/28/2015 Best place for morning coffee. Yeah it can get busy on sat and sun mornings, but the coffee is good and the food is too! Blueberry scone is my favorite. They have a lot of cakes and stuff, but I've never bought them. They are reasonably priced overall. ", pos 
Russell’s Bakery ," 5/2/2014 4 check-ins Down the street from where I was working, this is a quick and easy place for lunch. Be forewarned it is a bit popular though. The number of tables available definitely is more than the number of cars the parking lot can hold.  For the tortilla chips and tomato soup alone, I give four stars. The chips are the BEST I've ever had. They're fresh and light, better than any Mexican restaurant I've been to. I love eating the torilla chips and using the tomato soup as a dip. I am not a huge tomato soup fan, but it's creamy and not acidic here. It's probably the best tomato soup I've tasted.  The sandwiches and salads could be better. When you get a chicken caesar salad, you actually receive slices of chicken instead of shredded/diced/cubed, which I found very strange. The tuna sandwich is very plain and doesn't have much in it. I wasn't impressed. I like sweet relish and celery in my tuna fish sandwich, but maybe that's just me. My coworker's on a gluten free diet, and the gluten free bread is terrible. It's really gummy and tasteless.  I'd give two stars for the sandwiches and salads, while giving four stars for the chips and tomato soup for an average of three stars. You can easily get a soup, salad, and dessert at lunchtime for less than $15 (including tax and tip), which isn't too bad. The food is pretty quick, so it's not a bad lunch option! ", neutral

My all time favorites have to be the cinnamon roles (they make theirs with cinnamon sugar on top, I am not a fan of icing on my roles so I love this option) and the coconut cake.

I usually get iced americanos for coffee, so not much to complain about. The staff here is always friendly and helpful. So that's a plus. I've gotten their hazelnut lattes as well and they are much more flavorful than Starbucks.  Most of the cake selection I've tried have been underwhelming however. Only dessert/baked item I've had that is really good would have to be their Apple fritter. Exceptional. But I would skip all of their cakes. They just aren't all that great. Not worth the calories.

This place is calm and quiet and cold--it would be a great place to post up with a laptop as well as enjoy a meal with friends. We opted to sit indoors given the heat.  I tried the chicken salad sandwich--a ""favorite."" It was a favorite of mine for sure. I also had a cup of their chicken tortilla soup on the side. It wasn't spicy at all and had big chunks of avocado and tortilla strips floating in a tomato broth. My chicken salad was pretty delish as well with little chunks of celery for texture. A friend got one of their warm croissants and was raving about how great it was. This same fried almost bought out their dessert cabinet before we left.

Russell’s Bakery ," 8/18/2012 Tuna Fish Sandwiches, oh yea! Tuna Fish Sandwiches, so good! Russell's was the only eatery close to my claustrophobic apartment, and it became sacred to me. I use to get up and my boyfriend would go out for coffee, and I'd talk to him and listen on the high octane fuel of their house coffee. After the half year mark, a Batista put a leaf or a heart of foam in my mocha's. Those were my happiest days in Austin. If I went for lunch this meant that my boyfriend cared about me that day, and I always got Tuna Fish Sandwiches. I enjoyed their art up for sale too. In my one year of living in Austin, Texas, half my photographs are taken at Russell's. It's a wonderful place to take loved ones and enjoy a moment in the busy city.

The coffee is better than average but nothing to write home about (but refills are free).  I got the half sandwich and soup combo and it was very good but the only reason they didn't 5 stars is because their prices are a tad bit high.

So I've purchased her last 5 birthday cakes from Russell's since I found out about them.  Recently my parent's celebrated their 50th wedding anniversay and we called on Russell's to wow us yet again. They succeeded by leaps and bounds. When I presented the cake at the party, the crowd let out a loud ""OOOOOOHHHHH."" Then they took pictures of the cake before we sliced it up.  Alway fresh, rich and made to order. Thank you Russell's Bakery. ", pos

Russell’s Bakery , 7/14/2013 This was a relaxing spot for a light weekend lunch or midday snack.  I had the sandwich combo which included a half sandwich (I had the turkey club) and a salad.  It was a reasonable portion and well prepared.  My husband had cake and a latte.  Both of which he thought were delicious!   Service was excellent and very helpful.  It is counter service but they bring the food to you and this done very promptly.   I would definitely go back. , pos

Russell’s Bakery ," 5/15/2014 I love, love, love Russell's. These folks are wonderful people and their pastries are incredible. They truly epitomize everything that is great about local businesses run by people who care about their customers. Going there just makes you feel good.  And they know what they're doing. I cannot recommend them highly enough - for anything from a pastry and cup of coffee to an elaborate custom cake or catering order, you will not find anyone better.  PS - Amen to everyone who has mentioned the amazingness of their cinnamon roles! I relocated from Austin to LA, and I can testify that the relocated Austinites around here miss them like they miss Barton Springs! ", pos

As I've mentioned in other reviews, I'm not a big fan of ordering at a counter.  But they are so nice here, they don't rush you and answer questions with a smile.  Everyone enjoyed their meal.  The Greek salad was HUGE.  The massive ham and cheese croissant needed it's own zip code.

Russell’s Bakery ," 5/15/2013 Hands down the BEST tomato bisque soup I have ever had! I live in LA but I've been coming to Austin a couple of times a year for the last 13 years or so. My sister used to live down the street from Russell's 12 years ago. That's when I discovered it! I try to stop by when I visit. Did I mention I LOVE their soup?? We have gotten cakes from them several times and they've always been excellent! Another tip is always choose the butter cream frosting! It's amazing! The cream cheese frosting isn't very good. It tastes a bit fake and the texture is off. But the chocolate cake with chocolate butter cream couldn't be better. Did I mention my family owns a bakery in Los Angeles? Trust me, I know what good cake should taste like! ", pos 
Russell’s Bakery , 12/13/2014 Best coconut cake in Austin and the chocolate espresso cake was fabulous.  Both cakes were a huge hit.  Very friendly and helpful staff.  I won't go anywhere else for cakes. , pos 
Russell’s Bakery ," 3/14/2013 This would probably be 2 stars but since I didn't try the baked goods I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt.  OK service first. The girl at the register was sub par, she didn't seem to happy to be at work. Now the gentleman who got me my water was lovely.  OK now on to my food... so maybe Austin has spoiled me in my expectations of bakery/cafes, but when a customer asks a question about a component of their food you should NEVER use the phrase ""like what you would use at home."" To describe anything. ESPECIALLY the bread when you are a bakery. If I'm paying $6-7 for a veggie sandwich I can at least hope for some good bread.  On the note of a veggie sandwich, it was very uninspired. Mayo, mustard, lettuce, tomato, avocado, cucumber, and cheese. Heck thundercloud offers sprouts, hummus, mushrooms, and an actual roll (over sliced bread) for cheaper. I ordered the half sandwich and salad meal so now ill cover my salad. I got the Caesar, simple enough. Guess not. It was woefully under dressed (my waistline is greatful but my mouth was sad), and the greens were a little sour. The croutons were nice enough, baked croissants. The big downfall was the olives in the salad. I love olives but since the salad wasn't dressed enough to begin with the olives dominated the flavor profile. Last but not least let me cover the salsa. So the combo comes with tortilla chips but expect to pay 50 cents for the salsa. I didn't mind this because they said they make it themselves and I am a salsa fiend. Sadly it didn't live up either. The salsa had no kick at all, all you could taste was tomatoes. It needed more peppers, cilantro, lime, and salt.  Honestly I wanted to like this place so badly, I love bakery /cafes so much and since my favorite one went out of business I have been on the hunt for a new one... this isn't the one for me.

They have a delicious selection of baked goods, cakes, pastries, etc. The cakes look amazing, I have had my eye on the carrot cake for some time. Their cinnamon rolls and schnicken (sp?) are flaky and delicious. Prices for baked goods are about right. They make a good espresso or cappuccino; the coffee is better than average but nothing to write home about (but refills are free). What stands out for me is the great service, the workers are friendly, helpful, and keep the place clean. The service is what keeps me coming back.  The sad truth is that there are not many other options in the area unless you are willing to hold your nose and check out one of the 2-3 Starbucks in the area.  Recommended, 4 stars for the pastries!

Russell’s Bakery ," 7/25/2010 ROTD 11/16/2010 Listed in Review of the Day? More like review of the CENTURY. This is a delightful spot for brunch on a weekend. Maybe my opinion is inflated by one too many so-so experiences at Kerbey Lane, which neighbors Russell's, but I'm amazed we didn't stop in here sooner, and I'm fairly certain we'll be back here before we bother with ol' KL again.  Our breakfasts were note-perfect, starting with the eggs and going on down to the mimosa for me and his coffee. The menu sounds tasty from top to bottom; dinners seem to be a bit on the pricey side.  Friendly service and cute-for-a-coffee-shop atmosphere. They might not hit the perfect note every time, but for us on the muggy, relaxed day we stopped in, it was juuust right.  OK, one complaint: wobbly tables. Why is it that so many places have this issue? ", pos

Yes, the Chocolate Indulgence is that good. It is like this Chocolate Mousse thing they don't always have on hand, but when they do...get it.  The bakery itself is quaint. It isn't open very late so I can't really make it a regular hang-out. But if you want to pick up dessert for dinner it is a great place to go. ", pos 
Russell’s Bakery ," 3/23/2009 Great coffee and chai. It's clean and the people are nice. The baked goods are wonderful. It does seem like I've seen thier pumpkin bread and other items at other coffee places. Almost one entire wall is glass and I love the light.

I should have listened to him!  When we walked in my first thoughts were ""Wow, those are nice espresso machines!"" The rows of games in front clued me in to what they really cater to - REAL board games. Some games are very involved and can last for days, others fairly simple and can wrap up in 15 minutes.  The menu is mostly sandwiches but they are excellent - get the panini pressed! Mocha is To.Die.For and their selection of beers is fabulous. The have a delicious cider on tap that I will go back for and they also have sake(!) that can be served hot or cold.  Staff are more than happy to help find a game that fits your preferences. We decided to play a tiles game that was a lot of fun!  The space *is* a bit tight but the owners have obviously tried to squeeze as much as they could into a smaller space as legally (and safely) possible. Think of it as a grandma's well-lit basement - good food, beer on tap, and a bit claustrophobic with all the memories squished into a tight buy happy space. ", pos 
Emerald Tavern Games & Cafe ," 7/12/2016 7 check-ins Board games are NOT just for children. In fact, I didn't even know there were so many others kinds of games besides your standard Monopoly and checkers!  Emerald Tavern is a great board game shop and cafe that lets you test out games from their Game Library before you buy it. Yes, you can play board games here!! Their Game Library is huge and well-stocked with the newest games! They all have stickers that will tell you how long each games takes to play, too.  Yes, it's free to play their games, but you should really at least 1) purchase something from the cafe (they do have alcohol), and 2) leave a review for this small business so they can get even more business, or even 3) consider purchasing your board game here instead of Amazon.  There is definitely limited seating for the board games, so be sure to come early to snag a table for you and your friends! They also have some events like Painting with a Pint. Be sure to check our their website for the full calendar.  Emerald Tavern is a great place to discover new games and to interact with your friends! ", pos

Back wall has a library of different games that you can check out and play with friends for free at any one of the many tables available.  Fun place to spend an evening playing board games and drinking a great beverage and eating a sweet (they offer a nice little variety of different pastries/sweets). They need one of these in the town I live in!!  Perhaps the only thing that keeps me from giving it a a 5 would be the cost of the games on the shelf for purchase; none seemed to be on sale but perhaps I am just not up to date on what board games cost these days.  Not noisy, so you can hear each other well and has good lighting to see the cards/board game. Would definitely come back. ", pos 
Emerald Tavern Games & Cafe ," 5/4/2016 I'm so happy my friend took me to this place! There's no time limit here, so we easily spent 3 hours here trying out various board games. If you like the game you tried, you can easily purchase it here! The prices for their games were on-par with Amazon (maybe $1-2 more) so it's not terrible and you support a local business!  To borrow their games, you have to purchase a food/drink. I got a glass of mead and one chocolate chip cookie. Their cookie was soft, chewy, and filled with chocolate goodness. It definitely tasted fresh, and I would get it again!  The only downside is that the place is a bit small which makes it hard to find a table at times. ", pos 
Emerald Tavern Games & Cafe ," 10/9/2016 Went here today with some family and friends. The food was incredibly well priced, and pretty tasty. The coffee drinks were a higher standard than expected. The bathrooms were super clean and stocked. Most of the staff was incredibly helpful and inviting. We kept getting drinks and ate lunch throughout the 6 hours we were there, my boyfriend and i spent about $40 for all the drinks and food, and had a great time. Board games were categorized and even had an expected time limit on them. Really recommend this place, especially when looking for something for everyone. ", pos 
Emerald Tavern Games & Cafe ," 6/30/2016 A group of my team mates from work and I went here a few weeks ago because we didn't have a place to play board games. We all live in pretty small apartments and had never been here before so we wanted to check it out.  I like to be freezing cold in the summer time and I was thrilled that it was so cold in there. I mean the temperature was absolutely perfect. Their library of games was huge and the atmosphere was very friendly. The staff seem passionate about what they do and that's a huge plus to keep me coming back to any business. A happy employee gives any establishment the positive energy it needs.  The reason I'm giving 4/5 stars though is because we went on a Thursday and this place was packed! There was barely enough room between us and the tables on either side of us. With Austin growing, I think a lot of the smaller businesses in the area may need to go bigger. Also, I work night shift and don't get off of work until 12:30 am. I can't enjoy our new beloved Emerald Tavern because of this. :( Not their fault on the timing but the space in there made a couple of my co-workers have to keep going outside because they're claustrophobic. I shall return though! ", pos

It's a great place to meet other people to play board games with, has a decent food and drink selection, and a very welcoming atmosphere.

After not finding neither checkers nor chess, we actually ended up having a ton of fun over Scrabble (me more so than the date since I won... Mwahahaha #competitive).

I've popped in here a few times. The first time just for a coffee with a friend but the second time I popped in with a group of 8 for all kinds of trouble. We got there early and snagged 2 tables side by side. If you have a large group and require two tables, bear in mind that they require you fill out the tables. If we had had 7 people, we would have had to give up one of the tables and crowd around one smaller one. So come in groups of 4, 6, or 8 unless you like to crowd around a smaller table.  Large selection of games for purchase or to play for free. A whole wall of in house games! Most people are fairly quiet as they play but there are the occasional tables that are playing a game that involves a bit more enthusiasm (Cards Against Humanity, for example). Overall, it's a great environment for however player you are.  I haven't tried any food, but I have tried drinks! Their Chai Latte isn't too bad. Haven't tried the espresso yet because Miss Kaylee behind the counter tempted me with a special wine smoothie and then one of their menu items: the Beesting. Half cidar, half mead. SO GOOD.

They have alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks which are comparable to Starbucks prices. I think one of the best things about this place is the temperature. The temperature is never to hot or too cold in this place! Temperature may be one of the last things one would consider when playing a game, but hey, it sure does help when you're battling for wheat as one of the settlers of Catan.

In exchange for buying something at the cafe or a game from the store, you can play whatever game is available on the shelf  in the back (or if you bring your own) and you can put a flag at your table if you desire for others to join you.  It's a great way to possibly meet new people or kick it with a group of friends.  We came here to try out Carcassonne and decide if it was worth buying.  We had a wonderful time sipping on cider and beer and figuring out how to play the game with our friends.  The staff is really friendly and helpful.  They also make some delicious paninis! They have a good selection of drinks, coffee, and desserts.  The atmosphere was very lively and I love the music playing in the background - lots of HP soundtrack songs and other mystical tunes that helps transport you to whatever magical game world you are currently experiencing.

Grew up on dungeons and dragons, so this place was amazing for them. In the front of the store there are all sorts of games and memorabilia for sale. Towards the middle/back, there are communal tables and a nice selection of board games to borrow. It was pretty cool to see everyone hanging out with their friends and games wrapped up in what they were doing. If you like D&D, that's great but people were playing othello and chess there too.  The food leaves a little bit to be desired but that's not the reason you come here. They have a nice selection of beer and other adult beverages, including a coffee bar. I'd definitely come again but would recommend with a group. Many of the games to borrow required 4+ players so that limited us to how many games we could select. ", neutral

Emerald Tavern Games & Cafe ," 5/17/2015 1 check-in My fiancé and I love emerald tavern. They are a fun place to hang out with friends and try new board games. Their selection of demo games is superb as well as their menu. They have a good offering of beers and coffees, as well as decent bites for those longer gaming sessions. Their game store is well stocked too. We try to buy here whenever possible to support this great place.  My one warning: space is limited and they will not hold a table for groups. We always call ahead to get an idea of the table situation and have never had a problem.  They will hold games if you call ahead. ", pos

Emerald Tavern Games & Cafe ," 2/22/2014 30 check-ins I followed their progress on Facebook, and have wanted to visit for some time now. I was finally able to accomplish that goal last night, when I met up with a few friends for beer and board games. Please not, this review will not cover their food options, since I did not eat anything while I was there.  I found their selection of beer, both on tap and bottled, to be really good. Their draft choices were fairly diverse, which is a solid win in my book.  I was very impressed with how large this place was. I went in assuming it would be much smaller. Seating was fairly decent too. While not as large as Dragon's Lair, they still had room enough for a big crowd. We arrived early in the evening, so things hadn't picked yet. My friends and I were able to have our pick of tables.  They have a good variety of board games, and miniatures. I've been struggling to balance my game purchases between Dragon's Lair, Great Hall, and 10th Planet in Cedar Park. It seems that I'll need to include Emerald Tavern as well.  Overall, I enjoyed myself immensely, and will be a regular visitor. This place has great potential, and I'm excited to see it grow. Pandemic at Emerald Tavern. ", pos

Emerald Tavern Games & Cafe ," 1/26/2015 This place is full of epic win! First visit this last weekend. Managed to get two tables worth of friends together totaling about 10 people for multiple games over about 6ish hours.   They have game selections for both ""grab off the shelf and play where you are"" as well as ""hey, you liked this? why not take one home with you!"" buying options. An  amazing setup and very friendly to all ages and gamer flavors. While there I saw board games, card games, dice games, RPGs and laptop lan games being played. Talk about a place that caters to everyone!   ""The picnic was delicious. The champagne was excellent. Remind me to send the Cardinal a note!"" - The food and drinks were VERY shiny. I personally had my fill of both ciders and coffee with a sandwich to tide me over until dinner and was a very happy gamer. No matter how you pick your poison, they had multiple flavors of beer, cider and non-alcoholic drinks to help quench the thirst of any great adventurer. Also the prices are super reasonable and the staff exceptionally friendly!   Even if you're not in the area, this place is worth going out of your way for. Definitely recommend taking the time to stop in, grabbing a pint of something tasty and sitting down for a game or three with friends!  PS--Hope you're able to get into a bigger space soon to accommodate all the adventuring parties wanting to hang out at the same time! ", pos 
Emerald Tavern Games & Cafe , 4/21/2015 1 check-in This place is half board game store and half coffee shop/beer pub.  A great concept if you like to play nerdy board games and half of your friends like beer and half like coffee.    I was here on a Tuesday afternoon at 2:30pm and there was plenty of table space to play.  I can't say it will be that way at all times though as I assume it gets busier in the evenings and weekends.  It is a CLEAN place too.  There is some patio space outside and the staff is friendly.  Definitely not my usual haunt (as I don't play board games) but I saw the word coffee and assumed they had free wifi (they do).

Emerald Tavern Games & Cafe ," 4/6/2015 This place is spectacular! I had only been to one other establishment that allows you to play games off the shelf (Outlaw Moon), but this was the first time I was able to do that with the option of buying coffee or beer. My boyfriend and I randomly stumbled upon this place but we were glad we did.  If you've been to Outlaw Moon already, I'd say this place offers a different selection of games. So I think you'd be able to discover something new that you may not have heard of before. We went at an odd time and yet the place was still bustling with a good crowd of people. There were only about 2 tables left completely open. Therefore it may get a bit complicated to find seating during peak times on weekends, but I can't say for sure.  Once you buy a game or beverage, you're free to grab any game off the shelf to try out. You can either grab an empty table to have your own private game with friends, put up a flag on the table to invite strangers to play, or join a table with a flag that's already playing a game. It seems like a great way to socialize and meet new people over some shared interests - while trying to beat them at something :) ", pos 
Emerald Tavern Games & Cafe ," 1/19/2015 Very cool place!  I haven't yet tried the food,  but I've been in a few times for drinks and D&D scheming.  Their selection of beers and wines are kinda limited but very well-curated, and there's a very warm, welcoming atmosphere from both the staff and the clientele.  The music and lighting set up a nice atmosphere.  They even have a few tables outside; perfect when the weather's good!  Their store of games and such is cool to browse, too.  Did a bit of this year's Christmas shoppin' there.  Really the biggest issue I have with the place is that it so completely nails its objective, and people know it - so it's always packed, often hard to get a table, and I feel guilty about sticking around when I do get a spot.  Still, I'll definitely be back!  Much love for the place. ", pos 
Emerald Tavern Games & Cafe ," 1/12/2015 This place is pretty amazing to meet up with a group of friends and play board games you all love but are too cheap to buy. Staff have always been pleasant, the coffee is great, and it's an easy place to feel comfortable.

Emerald Tavern Games & Cafe ," 9/23/2013 ROTD 2/5/2014 Four stars for innovation, but they have a long way to go. Our impressions:  The space is a long, skinny retail store conversion. There's a bar at the front with a few fancy beers on tap and many in bottles. They also make paninis and have deli snacks. There are a few aisles of games. Then the back half of the store has two clean restrooms and about six to eight large tables. Some tables are still just folding tables and folding chairs, but a few look to be of nicer wood. Get there early and grab them?  The ambiance isn't quite what I expected -- I was thinking dark and funky like Pinballz but it's more like a well-lit woodland cottage, maybe Gaelic themed. Needs more vines? The staff are very friendly and obviously play the games.  Some areas of improvement:  1) There needs to be a common area with common supplies: spare dice, plastic bowls for game pieces (like currency or marking tokens), pens and paper for scorekeeping. If they wanted to charge $1 to access this area, I'd be fine with that. Most games need some degree of tending once opened, and a few supplies would go a long way to helping make them more playable.  2) Laminated Rule Sheets or Game Guides. There are plenty of fun games to try, but without a guide, it's tough to know how to play in a casual setting. They could have serious bonus points for curating some easy setup guides or even master lists, like: if you have 4 players, try these games! A game menu, if you will, to match the beer menu.  3) Beer versus folding tables: we had some unfortunate spillage from table bumping on a busy night. Try serving everything in big Irish coffee mugs?  Overall, it's a really great idea being operated by interesting folks who care about community. Give them a try and help them get better! ", pos 
Emerald Tavern Games & Cafe ," 11/26/2013 1 check-in Not quite what I expected (I expected more tavern than store), but this place rocks.  I came in, got myself a veggie wrap (they don't make them there, but they're really, really good), and a pumpkin beer, and went to the back wall of OMG A MILLION GAMES that you can just sit down and play.  For free.  Just try them out.  How fun!  We hung out for a few hours - staff was friendly, beer selection was super yummy, and we played a couple different really fun games.  It was a rainy Wednesday night, so it wasn't super busy, but they did have plenty of people coming in and out (some playing games, sounded like some people discussing making games, and some hanging out with the staff).  It felt comfortable, cozy, and we'll be back with some friends to occupy a table, drink some beers, and make more of a dent in their wall-o-games.  If they had their own kitchen and a slightly larger variety of food (I would have loved a side salad, some fries, soup, normal cafe fare), I would totally bump this up to 5 stars.  Love to have another nerdy place in our 'hood! ", pos 
Emerald Tavern Games & Cafe ," 9/1/2014 Friendly staff, delicious drinks, and a great place to play games!  We spent 2-5pm on Labor Day Monday here and it was pretty packed by the time we left. If space is frequently limited like that, they might be better off cutting down their selection of games for sale and open up more table space, but obviously that depends on what their revenue division looks like.  I didn't mind the lighting - it's perfect for games. If I want mood lighting, I'll go to a traditional coffee shop.  We didn't grab any food, so I can't comment on that. ", pos 
Emerald Tavern Games & Cafe ," 9/19/2013 1 check-in First to Review The space was well lit and comfortable. However, table space is limited so if you're coming to game make sure you squat a spot early. Staff was friendly and fit the vibe very well. The place is new so they're still getting the hang of things, but I like them. They have a back wall ""library"" of games you can grab and start playing which is awesome. Half of the stuff on the wall I've never had the chance to try, so this is going to be exciting. ", pos

It doesn't hurt that its near to pinballz arcade, the combo totally creates the perfect nerdy date night.

I arrived at 6 on a Friday (after Thanksgiving) and was immediately greeted. Excellent service! Very friendly.  The mocha was too chocolaty and too sweet (yes, there is such a thing), but I still enjoyed my visit.  They have a very nice selection of games. The place is on the small side, but I like that they keep it simple. I was hoping that there would be more 3DS people (for street passes), but I suppose it is not that kind of Game Cafe.

The staff was friendly - they recommended various games and even stopped by to see how it was going and answered how-to questions. I've visited other game shops with my son and felt they were more intimidating and ""stiff"" compared to Emerald Tavern. The environment seemed pretty laid back,  with folks of all ages and various game knowledge hanging out.  I've noticed other's have commented on the menu, but I feel it's a bonus that they provide food and beverage for purchase. We didn't have any complaints because we went there to play, not eat.  My 10 year old son has asked that we hold family game night at this location,  so well be back soon! ", pos 
Emerald Tavern Games & Cafe ," 10/4/2014 2 check-ins Listed in Best Doods In Austin An obvious five stars because how diverse, delicious and original these guys are.  The Food: I think it is fantastic.  I have tried the Basil Pesto turkey sandwich, salami and bananas pepper, peanut butter and jelly, triple berry smoothie and they are all GOOD.  Can be hit or miss, but only about 20% of the time.  Plus their bread is so good!  They use a fantastic bread, makes it seem like they bake it in store or something.  The Staff:  I love how nerdy the staff is, because often times you can ask them about any game, and any rule and they are right there to pick up and answer that really weird question with ease.  Also, they are very easy to talk to, they often strike up conversations with you at the counter and care about your input.  The Games:  I can not believe the games they allow everyone to play for free.  This is honestly my main appeal.  I eat and drink about $10 worth of food over a 3 hours period and just play 3 or 4 games that they have on the wall.  As it stands, I looks like they have at least 50 board games you can try out and play.  I know I have played a game and then walked over and bought it for home.  The Prices:  The food prices are pretty decent, I don't drink beer, so I wouldn't really know, I suppose they are normal.  The game prices are the same prices that you would expect from any game store.  Its going to be cheaper on amazon by a couple bucks, but you can get it in the store free of shipping and support something amazing.  The times they are open are great and this place is just an already awesome place.  I just recently found it and I have been there almost 5 times in the last two weeks now.  This is my new regular spot! ", pos 
Emerald Tavern Games & Cafe ," 7/6/2014 Good idea and well intentioned but the other reviews are pretty much spot on in their criticisms. My biggest pet peeve is the lighting...its awful it makes you feel like your in the office scene from Joe vs the Volcano. Some dimmer or ""mood"" lighting would go a long way. The food options are definitely lacking in both choice and supply but the prices of drinks are reasonable. There is also relatively limited seating too.

Emerald Tavern Games & Cafe ," 2/5/2014 Emerald Tavern is a great place to hang out with friends, have a good beer, and play games. They have a great selection of demo games to play, and an OK selection of games to purchase. The beer selection is great! They are one of the few places in town where I have seen ""the duchesse"" sour beer.  I am giving 4 stars because I have not been anywhere quite like it. It is a great idea, and it is a great place for my game-loving friends and I to meet.  There are a few things to improve. The first of which is the food situation. The food is OK, but it is not made in-house. That means they can run out of popular items like the wraps. Still, I am very happy that Emerald has a panini press to warm the food up. It makes it a lot better.  Emerald almost always has a nerdy soundtrack playing, be it from Star Wars, Superman, or some other superhero movie. This fits quite nicely with the gaming theme, but it does get a bit old after one's sixth visit. It would be awesome if Emerald had a jukebox, especially if the jukebox were based on a mobile app, since it be nice to play our own playlists. ", pos 
Emerald Tavern Games & Cafe ," 8/19/2014 Short version: an open gaming store where you can come in and get beer or coffee while you play.  I've had a lot of fun here.  Suggestions:  - Peak times - You might want to call ahead on weekends.  They're mostly busy after 6 on Friday and Saturday, while Sunday just depends on the weekend.  If you call ahead they'll let you know how busy the place is but I'm told they don't do reservations.  - Food - Generally lackluster - eat ahead of time or walk over to Trudy's.  Pros:  - Good games selection both for public access and for a variety of tastes  - Good service, friendly atmosphere, generally a very upbeat group every time I've visited  - Drinks have been good to great.  The coffee and chocolate beverages are above average.  Cons:  - More and better food options OR let me bring my own.  Also, if you're going to make a Panini please charge me $.50 - $1.00 more and put some real cheese in there.  - I recently found out there are a list of rules on the wall.  They're about 11 pt font so you may not have noticed them either.  I don't know if this is good or bad, but it is definitely meaningless.  I think if you just put ""don't be a dick"" in big letters that would work too.  Wishlist:  - Different lighting, something a bit warmer (current lights are a standard dull white fluorescent)  One last note: word has it that the owner has a dim view of your dietary restrictions so I'm not sure what they'll say if you ask whether it's vegetarian or gluten free.  I can't stick this in the cons section as I haven't seen it first-hand and I'm already recommending against eating here. ", pos

They have a decent beer selection (given that they are a board game shop) and although the menu is limited everything I have tried has been tasty and not overpriced.  Their board game selection is acceptable and I hope in the future they expand it. I also really enjoy the fact that they host so many events (best way to meet new people).  The only complaint I have is that there needs to be more room for tables, a place as cool as this needs more room to accommodate all of the people it is drawing in. ", pos

Emerald Tavern Games & Cafe ," 12/9/2013 An up-and-coming spot community spot for gaming and crafted beers. While just three months old, the crew of Emerald Tavern is working to continuously improve their stock and atmosphere. Had a chat with the two owners about their business and vision- great people with a fair bit of knowledge about the general gaming industry, and lots of beer brewing experience.  I only stopped in for a coffee, so I can't directly comment on their typical gaming events.  Fantastic beer selection, both on tap and bottled.  The the owners are garage beer brewers with aspirations of expanding Emerald Tavern to incorporate an on-site brewery.  Another indirect bonus is that if their beer selection isn't to your liking (e.g., you want a plain-Jane Bud Light), Sherlock's Pub is virtually next door.  Besides the gaming atmosphere, I'll be coming back for the off-the-norm beer selection.  While I'll ding the decor for being very spartan (lots of white wall), the place is very clean and tidy. You can see the base for Tudor revival architecture (a possible explanation for the white walls) and decoration creeping in. I have no doubts that the look and feel of place will continue to grow as the business does; give it time.  Cheers! Side 2 of their beer and wine menu. Side 1 of their beer and wine menu.

Emerald Tavern Games & Cafe ," 10/10/2013 I don't think I've ever thought ""if only Austin had another place for tabletop gaming, it would be so nice."" This city is blessed with a very lively and active gaming scene.  Emerald Tavern is a nice little store with a game library of stuff you can use and some games you can purchase as well - the selection of games is kind of strange, as it's mostly lighter & more popular fare (Munchkin, Lords of Waterdeep, etc) but there are a few unexpected titles there as well (Combat Commander anyone?).  They seem to have a good selection of beers but I didn't try any yet. The latte I got was very good. Food options seem limited right now but I hear they're working on that. ", pos 
Emerald Tavern Games & Cafe ," 12/15/2013 Great concept, decent execution. The drink selection is excellent, with good coffee and very good beer. The food leaves something to be desired - overpriced pre-made sandwiches pressed on site. Sometimes I make it a point to eat before I go there, or just get the ramen. Dropping the sandwiches by a dollar or at least including chips at that price point would go a long way toward making it seem like the value matched the cost. Having some lighter beers would also help during those three hour games. A 6% abv usually takes me out of a long game by turn four.  Atmosphere could definitely use some work. The lighting is pretty harsh if I'm staring at a game for three hours. Also,  hearing the Star Trek and Star Wars soundtracks followed by 15 minutes of bagpipe on a loop get pretty unbearable by the end of one game. More table room for games and less retail space would make it seem more hospitable, especially on a busy night. I'm far less likely to spend money on drinks or even games if I can't actually find a place to sit. And that silly no e-cigarette rule? I can't imagine how encouraging people to go outside and smoke near your venue's entrance is better than allowing them to use a reasonably odor and carcinogen free alternative.  I hope this business figures out if it's a game store with a small cafe or a cafe that's a great place to game. I really hope it improves and succeeds. ", neutral

Table space can be an issue on the busy weekend nights, so get there early or game during the week - there's a fair amount of space on Monday nights.

They need to fine tune their operation a little though. First, it was *loud* when I went, and I had to lean into other players to hear them. Noise dampening would go a long way. Second, food runs out quickly on busy nights, to the point they have literally nothing to sell that you can put in your mouth for sustenance. Finally, there simply aren't enough tables. Sacrificing a shelf's worth of game profits for two or three extra tables would pay off quickly.  They're so close to having an epic business. Dragon's Lair shoulda thought of this a decade ago.

Unfortunately, you need decent lighting to play board games, but at the same time it makes the place less cozy than a traditional tavern.  They should remove the tables and replace them with booths that have individual lights (like Outback Steakhouse restaurants), so that the place looks more like a tavern when you walk in.  The drink selection is good, but I think they could offer a few more kinds of bottled beer.  And they need to provide some more food choices, especially healthy snacking foods.  You don't want to get fingers messy while playing board games, but it would be nice if I had more opportunities to spend money.  Normally, I just get one beer and maybe a hot chocolate and a snack.  I'd be happy to spend a lot more if they offered a lot more.  They have free wi-fi.  Ask at the counter for the password. ", pos 
Emerald Tavern Games & Cafe ," 10/4/2013 I've been to E.T. five times now and I'm very impressed.  The atmosphere is very nice.  Given its size, it isn't at all cramped - unlike another gaming store I know.  Points to the owners for paying attention to detail.  Some of the tables are of a nice wood construction which adds to the flavor and the Tudor theme that they are slowing bringing to light with the floor and wall accents.  Each time I go in more decor is getting added.  The thing that impressed me the most was the selection of games.  They have many of the games I've been wanting to try from BoardGameGeeks.  Bravo!  The beer selection is really nice and I hear they are adding wine soon.  The sandwiches and wraps are really good and they always bring them to my table so I don't have to miss out on any gaming.  Finally, the owners are very involved and accessible which makes me feel like it is only going to get better. ", pos 
Emerald Tavern Games & Cafe ," 7/27/2014 I'm giving them a generous 4 stars because I love the idea of the place and I'm partial to them because of my board gaming hobby. I enjoy coming to be surrounded with ""my people"".  I'd like to see them reach 5 star status but for that to happen they will have to seriously step up in the food department. I think recently they have improved in the fact that they are apparently making their sandwiches in-house now. Before they were ordering them and toasting them on-site but always under-ordering for the weekend. Saturday and Sunday continually had them running out and the options for a place that doesn't allow outside grub were pretty slim. I get it. I know they don't have a full kitchen. I know there are limitations when you don't have a ventilation system. I don't know if they have a walk-in or how much space they can spare for food but we'll see how in-house sandwich prep goes.The minimal baked goods they have is sad though. I really wish they'd step up here. They seem very focused on the 'craft beer' aspect of their business (understandable because of the profit margin) but with the coffee traffic they have coming through, more attention to items that go with coffee could only improve their sales. The muffins and turnovers are just the standard grocery store stuff, full of hydrogenated fats, artificial flavorings and high fructose corn syrup. Ah, such a missed opportunity. In my pre-mom days I was a pastry chef so I just can't help imagining what great things they could sell that would put them over the top (try real homemade brownies  and cookies for one) and on par with good coffee bars. I'd be happy to offer my services wholesale :). Anyway, food is my only real beef (ha ha!). I've gotten accustomed to the set up, though initially I thought games would've been better placed along the walls to allow both more table space and a glimpse into the gaming area for those curious about our fabulous board gaming hobby (Perhaps they are trying to keep us hidden in order not to scare away the uninitiated ? :)  hahaha! Could be.). But it is what it is and it's their baby not mine so I simply wish the owners all the luck in the world because I really enjoy spending time gaming at Emerald Tavern and hope they're around a long time.

Live Oak Market ," 4/26/2016 This place has everything!!  To be more specific, LOTS of booze variety, and also amazingly filling breakfast tacos.  These are a MUST if you are nearby and looking to save some money.  It may not be your fancy dining setup or this huge page by page menu of food items, just simple breakfast tacos.  Can choose from potato, bacon, sausage, ham, and I think another one but these are the most popular off the menu.    Take everything you THINK about breakfast tacos from an establishment and try these out.  Here's the thing.  These are not gourmet breakfast tacos so no fancy flavors or kale and what not.  These aren't dirty mexican tacos where the cheese has a miraculous way of hiding the meat.  Not, just a nice, simple, great, filling, legitimate, savory, satisfying, affordable, honest breakfast taco.  The Live Oak Market is also a great place to find some unique drinks to stock up on.  Never thought I'd see so many different root beers!  Everything else in between like milk and orange juice and nail clippers you will find in any other liquor store, but I like this place.  Wherever I plan to crash, stay, borrow, live, or rent in Austin, I want to make this place my go to spot for stocking up on drinks or enjoying, once again, an honest breakfast burrito. No joke, this is actually bacon bacon w/green sauce dots. ", pos 
Live Oak Market ," 3/22/2016 O.g. Austin right here.  They have all of the craft beers that you could ever want, tons of local beers, local soaps, food and so on.

You may find the prices might be a bit higher, but you will also notice the quality of the products in the store.  They have have an awesome grill that makes some pretty delicious sandwiches!    The first time I came here way back when was my friend wanted me to try the Cuban sandwich ... wow ... I loved it so much and then continued to stop in here continually.  I have also had the Reuben and the Turkey Basil Bacon, which are both spectacular as well.    Another reason they are my favorite place is the selection of craft beers.  Not only do they have craft beer, but they carry all kinds of specialty drinks, which sometimes I am in the mood for.    I also love the desserts I find in this store.  At the front counter they have these locally made coconut macaroons that are half covered in chocolate...mmm.  Also at the font they have Full English millionaire bars usually .... these may seem expensive but are worth every penny ... simply the best thing ever!  Plus they are made local a few blocks away at the Full English Cafe.  More of my favorites in here are the ice cream selections, soaps, chocolate and popcorn!

Also--I was looking for something that stood out, I saw an Icehaus ice cream sandwich that looked beautiful and OMGosh.....it was AMAZING!

Live Oak Market ," 9/23/2015 1 check-in This is a whole different animal, this corner store.  I fell for this place from the first visit.  It's fabulous.  I'm not from Austin but I visit regularly.  I always shed a slight tear when I leave town and see Live Oak Market in my rearview mirror.  I wish they had a place like this where I live: A converted convenience store that sells legitimate, quality food, great coffee, tacos, sandwiches and so much more. It's a brilliant concept that makes eating healthy food convenient, something that a lot of people struggle with.  They have a real grill right behind the counter and prepare food right there. All this in the space of a standard 7-Eleven.    Service is oh-so-friendly and the quality of everything is great.  The facility is clean and they've got a huge selection of everything, including beers, wines, and exotic sodas, ginger ales, root beers, etc.  They have a personal items section with a wide array of natural toiletries in case you run out of aluminum free deodorant or patchouli oil (I'm talking to you, hippie!).  Smokers, they have every pack of organic, natural, exotic cigarette you can imagine and a variety of smoking essentials. My personal favorite tid-bit:  It's smack dab in the parking lot of a Randall's store (in your face, regular grocery store!).  Seriously, though, I love this because it's a nice enough Randall's so if, by some odd chance, there's something you can't get here, there's an option nearby and that particular Randall's is not the worst one around.  Co-locating is a good thing in this case.  There are chairs and tables out front and there are plenty of places to park a bike with a reasonable level of security (and being able to see it), very important for me.  I love this place.  I love, love, love this place.  Live Oak Market should be the model for similar stores and, when you're ready to bring your concept elsewhere, I'll be your first customer. ", pos 
Live Oak Market ," 5/4/2014 1 check-in From the outside, Live Oak doesn't seem very fancy on the outside. But it doesn't matter because this is one of the stores which have unique flair to it. It's almost as if you don't have to have a fancy exterior.  Live Oak is a convenience store where they sell organic food and products, campy drinks (I dare anyone to drink the Ranch soda), a good selection of beer and wine, and good sandwiches made to order. I was on my way to class I swore I could have started grocery shopping. But first, food before I head to class. I bought the bacon, turkey and basil sandwich which was good and satisfying. If I didn't have somewhere to go, I would have sat outside. If anyone lives close to this area, I would be constantly shopping there almost every week. This will be going into someone's Christmas stocking. Holy wine! I dare anyone to try these sodas. See all photos from Bernadette D. for Live Oak Market ", pos

Live Oak Market ," 12/29/2013 Listed in The Yelp 100 Challenge Great place to start before a full day of drinking :)  This place was on the way to 512 brewery from the hotel I was staying.  For the price you can't beat what you get.  I can't say they were amazing or anything different from other breakfast tacos I have had in the past though.  For a two bucks a piece you can get three or four tacos and leave with a full tummy for sure.  The coffee was pretty good too.  Don't expect this place to win any foodie flavor awards but if you are in the area and need something decently quick to eat for a great price this is your spot.  I do not suggest the Cubano though.  The pork they used did not taste right to me.  Couldn't tell exactly what it was but it just didn't taste right.

Live Oak Market ," 9/12/2015 It's unfair to call Live Oak Market a convenience store. The diverse craft beer selection is top shelf. As evidenced by the locally produced bison and quail sausage, the menagerie of high end snacks is top shelf. The staff is top shelf. The music is top shelf. Nora Jones and the Clancy Brothers in the span of 10 minutes?  And the food...The sandwiches are top shelf. There are about a dozen to choose from and they're all made to order. Seriously, why go to Subway when you can get a Cubano with fresh, top shelf ingredients for less than the cost of a footlong. Sure, Live Oak Market is convenient, but it's orders of magnitude more refined than a garden variety 7-11. Plus, it's locally owned and operated. ", pos

I'm new to the area and only pulled in here twice, both times in a bit of an ""emergency"" situation. (Yes, bacon chocolate - or rather, the lack thereof - is in fact a life or death situation.)

The cuban sandwich, cool haus ice cream sandwiches, and the eclectic selection of stuff they offer. Man that Cuban sandwich... only time in my life I have driven to a cornerstore for a sandwich,  They have too many cool and unique snacks/drinks/food here to list, so I'll just list some of the words that differentiate their inventory from other cornerstores: organic, fair trade, imported, rare, unique, interesting, unexpected. Just come here and browse around for 20 minutes. I guarantee you will find something that you will buy.  And while their stuff is pretty much all great, they are a little pricey.

Live Oak Market ," 3/11/2014 Great selection of local goods, solid beer selection, but what really stands out about this place is the sandwiches they offer. Their Cuban sandwich is one of the better ones out there, especially considering it's coming from a convenience store, and not a full-blown restaurant.  Beyond that, the staff has never been anything but friendly to me, whether I'm asking for recommendations or just want to chat. I try to stop in every time I'm on this side of town. ", pos

Live Oak Market ," 4/12/2013 Chances are, you're not using Yelp to find out which is the best convenience store. But on the off chance that you're on the south side and you're faced with the dilemma of where to go, be fortunate that yelp has led you here.  Live Oak Market is the best convenience store in South Austin. Possibly in the rest of the city as well. It is so good that I go here when it's inconvenient as well. Why? Because the beer selection is better than any of the nearby stores. I like to look at this as the convenience store version of the Central Market that's not too far away.  The food is good and not your typical fare. Very hippy type stuff, and also a lot of unusual things and local brands. Do you know of another place in Austin that carries srichacha flavored peas? Nor do I. How about semi-rare root beers?  And let's be honest-the real reason I go here? The beer. I get most of the beer for my house here, because I don't drink swill. And if you're intimidated by good beer-the workers here can talk about it forever. I haven't really spent time ordering food and just hanging around, but I'm sure I could. ", pos 
Live Oak Market ," 9/28/2011 16 check-ins This is a cool, authentic ""Austin"" place - not a 'chain' but run by dudes who have interesting tastes, not only in how to stock a convenience store (lots of local products, WIDE range of craft beers, even good soap..) but also in their selection of the Reggae blasting in the background.  I understand that the sandwiches are good (never tried 'em) but I generally drop by for Virgil's Zero Root Beer (Stevia sweetened) that I can't find anywhere else in town. They also have Fentiman's Botanically Brewed sodas to go with the array of flavored popcorn on display throughout the store.  My only gripe are the prices - a tad high. And there are sometimes grifters and deadbeats bumming people for moolah (they are aggressive at times). ", pos 
Live Oak Market ," 10/13/2014 This store is awesome. It's so Austin-the real one not the new, trendy version we live in now.

When you're wanting a quick lunch, a new tasty beer, or hangover cures go to this cute little market and you'll find anything your heart desires.

Live Oak Market ," 1/23/2013 18 check-ins Not sure I can really say anything that hasn't been said that is positive.  They have a nice selection of beer, and apparently the PAH knee KNEES are off the chain as well.    I guess I should just stop beating around the bush, I like to drink and the Oak is local to my place so I can walk here and get my fix if need be.    Staff is pretty cool, in their own hipster way.  Maybe it's because I always come in incognito, so I may be treated with indifference because I am a master of disguise.  Or maybe I haven't been reading the hipster code of ethics, so I may be missing the point all the way around.  At least homeboy that speaks to me in Japanese has the pronunciation correct of whatever words he chooses to say to me.

Live Oak Market ," 12/6/2012 90 check-ins Love Live Oak Market! I have lived in the Austin area since 2008 but have discovered this gem only within the last 12 months. I love their wide selection of local & craft beers. They also keep a good rotation of ""good beers"" on ice up front. They do not have a ""make your own 6 pack"" option here, but you can find 6 or more different craft beers in that front ice bucket.   I honestly have not tried their food but will make it a point to do so in the near future. Live Oak also has other local merchandise available for sale, ranging from snacks & ice cream to coffee & organic products; enough to satisfy even the most hipsterfied of south-Austinites! Next week Live Oak will be launching a second location of a different name, on the corner of S.Congress Ave/ Live Oak St (ironic!) & look forward to checking out to see if this other store will have the same ""south Austin feel"" that Live Oak has.   To sum it up: I wish I would have discovered Live Oak market sooner! ", pos

Lets just say I love this place. Their sandwiches are some of the best in town. The soda selection is also amazing ( I recommend Barton springs root beer). They have great beers and strange hippy snack food as well. However, my favorite part about going is the characters who work there. I always seem to have an interesting conversation, whether it is music, beer, wine, or Selena. It isn't your run of the mill convenience store. If you're on northern Manchaca you should definitely stop by. ", pos

Live Oak Market ," 8/28/2012 4 check-ins it is easy to drop some dough in here.  like a hippie 7- eleven with slamming sandwiches, this place always makes me happy.    a truly unique austin business, they cater to the hipsters with well chosen, specialty products.  From craft beers, ciders and good wines to all natural, import and local food products - it is all good.  I particularly like that they carry a bottled thai coffee, 3 or 4 electrolyte waters, a variety of funky, tasty sodas, goats milk ice cream and a variety of kombuchas.  They have some of my favorite local austin snacks, like the PB&J bars, dulce de leche coconut macaroons and the like.    They also have locally made products like soaps and candles.  There are general groceries, like annie's boxed macaroni and halo all natural dog foods.    They make reallly tasty sandwiches.  I like the curry chicken salad, the cuban and the turkey bacon basil.    You can easily put together a wonderful gift basket at this store, get some nommy snacks for self and friends or grab a sandwich for lunch or grab some provisions to make dinner.    The staff is very friendly,  there are more new faces than normal lately.  They tend to try all the products in the store and will gladly recommend a wine (Hombre), beer, candy, soda  or the like.  There are regulars a plenty at this location, it can get busy.    Oh, and they have a wifi and a few chairs/tables in front of the store.  With all this in mind, i gotta give 'em a 5, as there is no better convenience store in Austin. ", pos

Live Oak Market ," 2/10/2014 This place rocks!  Having just moved here a couple weeks ago, this was my first time in the store. My Austin friends have been talking about it since I arrived, and today we finally made it in. I am so glad we did.  It was one of the friendliest shopping experiences I've had in a long time. The minute I walked in, I was greeted by a very nice dude who gave me a high five and welcomed me to Live Oak. I wandered over to wine (awesome selection!) and another dude came over and spent a good five to ten minutes telling me about their wines and the history of different vineyards and what's special about which bottles. Clearly I didn't understand what Live Oak was all about, because it was a little surprising to get such informed and interesting help choosing a bottle of wine at a convenience store. He really knew his shit, and was also just really nice and funny. We spent probably 20 minutes browsing around and trying to decide what to buy. There were so many great options to choose from!  I hear they have great coffee and great sandwiches. They also have wifi. You could probably hang out there. The great selection and prices is reason enough to go there regularly, but the people that work there make it feel like somewhere you want to be all the time. ", pos

Live Oak Market ," 6/13/2012 4 check-ins I will preface this review by saying I have never liked soda.  I despise it at all costs.  I have never liked it- the carbonation is what makes me shudder.  When I was a kid, I used to throw a fit at birthday parties if someone gave me a Sprite by mistake instead of water.  I just plain don't like soda.  That being said, I, TOO, LOVE THIS PLACE!!!  This store is full of really cool, hard to find sodas for those in my life who drink them.  I initially stepped in the store during the Great Dublin Dr. Pepper Murder and was able to pick up a few cases at retail for our family's special occasions.  Many other places were taking advantage of the Dublin drink, marking up the price in stores and on Ebay.  Nope, this place was very fair and not-greedy, so it prompted me to come in and wander more often.  I have brought home an array of sodas for my loved one and his friends.  Some of them are stranger than others.  Triple XXX Root Beer is a classic find, but we've also come home with PB&J Soda (yes, Peanut Butter & Jelly).  There is also a great selection of non-carbonated beverages, many of which I have yet to try because their collection is so extensive.  I've never tried the food from behind the counter, but it always smells delicious.  I find this place a good place to try new chocolates.  I recently came across bricks of Côte-d'Or dark chocolate that are so decadent and hard to share.  They also have Kinder products (no eggs, though).  Of course there is always Emergency Chocolate, too.  So overall, I absolutely love this store, even though I dislike carbonated bevvys.  If you have never stepped inside, I encourage you to step inside.  You'll probably come out with something awesome. ", pos 
Live Oak Market ," 10/27/2014 Best convenience store in Austin (Sorry I'm not sorry Royal Blue)! The staff is SUPER friendly and kind. I always walk into the store with a warm greeting.

Live Oak Market , 7/16/2012 I can't begin to describe how thankful I am  that this neighborhood market is right around the corner.  Pros: - Locally owned and they go out of their way to support Texas small businesses - Staff is friendly and pretty knowlegeable. They have helped me obtain a few rare beers I couldn't get anywhere else. - Their is Turkey Basil Bacon Sandwich is yummy (I hear people love the BLT as well) -They also have Saint Arnold's Root Beer which is very very good if you never had it before.  Cons: - Prices tend be a little high - I want to buy too much when I'm there  Over all the pros outweigh the con's and that makes me a very happy person. , pos 
Live Oak Market ," 11/12/2012 1 check-in My doctor's office is a couple blocks away from this place, so I like to swing by after I go to the doctor. The people at the counter were super nice--and there are tons of cool things to buy here. Everything is reasonably priced. The stuff that you can find more or less anywhere is priced typically, then they've got some more expensive stuff that's higher quality (all natural, organic candies and craft beers for example).  As far as their sandwiches, I was a little disappointed. It brags that it's supposed to be a hipster corner store, so I came in freezing and looking for something warm and vegan. None of their sandwiches are vegan, but luckily I was there in the morning and I was able to get a breakfast taco. I know it sounds really stingy of me, but the breakfast tacos (which WERE good) come with three ingredients; only two of the options were vegan, so I was paying for an ingredient i couldn't have.  Anyway, I gave the store three stars because they do carry vegan gummy candies (which are my favorite and IMPOSSIBLE to find; usually they've got gelatin in them) and a variety of other great things at a decent price that I can never find anywhere else. If you eat cheese, I imagine there are probably some good sandwiches, and if you eat meat, I bet they're even better. I don't drink, but if I did, I'd probably like the place even more, because they've got walls of beer and wine that I've never heard of before. It's worth a try, even if you are vegan, but don't go out of your way for it. ", neutral

You won't just find ice cream here, you'll find organic goat's milk ice cream.  you won't just find soap here, you'll find all-natural locally made soap.  The list goes on and on.  Their beer selection does not beat Whip-In's, but it is still far and beyond any other store of its scale in town.

They have the coolest selection of items from an organic, vegan, agave cola. To choclate kale. All the Austinites would love all the weird options.  The most important thing. The paninis are awesome. I think they're a little too expensive for just the panini. It was like 6 dollars. but they're still really good. They still were surprisingly filling.

Parking is a bit tricky, as there is a small lot and the rest is street parking which is pretty congested on a weekday afternoon.  The inside space is cozy with limited seating. On a nice day, there is outdoor seating as well.  The menu is creative with a Middle Eastern flair, meets healthy Austin deli for that perfect bite. My friend and I ordered a salad and sandwich to split.  The Bacon Alma sandwich which was a grilled combination of bacon, sliced apples, artistically topped with a spicy tahini and siracha sauce. The bacon and apples were such a great combination with the cheeses, and I loved that the sandwich had a sauce on top.  The Roasted Beet and Chickpea salad had cucumber, feta, and onions, and we opted for the Ararat's Pomsoy vinaigrette. The salty/sweetness of the vinaigrette was a nice combination with the roasted beets.  The portion sizes were hearty enough that splitting one was a meal in itself and they were nice enough to split the portions for us.  The service was fast and friendly, and they delivered our order to us out on the patio. They provide free wi-fi and offer a variety of other soups, sandwiches, salads and breakfast fare.

Hot Mama’s Cafe ," 8/22/2016 Listed in 2016 Yelp 100! I've actually never been to the restaurant itself. However Hot Mama's Cafe catered to our office for lunch and the food was great. The ingredients in the Egyptian Salad were super fresh. Not sure what makes it ""Egyptian"" though. There were two types of Hummus - Lemon Garlic which was new and interesting and Southwest which was closer to regular hummus but slightly different. The Pita Bread that came with it was as it should be.  I sampled two kinds of rice...I believe it said it was Long grain basmati rice seasoned with turmeric & another type of rice with butter. Both were delicious. I have no complaints.  As with the salad, the ingredients in the Roasted Vegetable Entree were first class! The Roasted Lamb was truly a delight. It was soft and tender without too much seasoning..in fact, nothing was overtly seasoned or greasy and it felt like I was eating good quality healthy food.

Persian Prince Panini- just try it. No words can describe it! Vanilla Coke- The team mix it themselves and it really is so bloody good!!  It is such good quality for your money.

The portion was a good size, and the food was perfect!! My husband got the lamb jammer I think it was called, and he said it was great too. Also their mocha was yummy!!'

Hot Mama’s Cafe ," 4/11/2013 1 check-in Listed in Middle Eastern Eats (Austin) It seems that I'm always on the hunt for on-point and inspired Middle Eastern fare that doesn't come from a food truck here in Austin... somewhere casual but the kind of space in which I can sit for awhile and actually enjoy my meal.  At last, I've found it.  Within minutes of walking in, I decided that I'd soon be a regular at Hot Mama's. The space and the staff are totally inviting - even though I walked in right before close, they didn't attempt to make me feel guilty about placing a last-minute order. Instead, they invited me to take my time and chill. I decided to order a coffee as well, and took up residence on their outdoor patio. Life is good!  Then, life got even better. My Arawrap (Hot Mama's proprietary wrap creation) arrived and before I even tasted it, I could smell it: a grilled tortilla filled with tender slices of roasted New Zealand lamb, fresh tabouli and a sauce secretly spiced with what I believe to be turmeric. Somehow, it tasted delicately sweet yet the flavors still swung savory... a mystery that'll keep me coming back.  Looking forward to making this zen little cafe my new home away from home... office hours, anyone? ", pos

Inside there are sofas and a coffee table and quiet little nooks to sit in. If you want to sit at an actual table you can sit outside. Luckily for me, it wasn't too hot to sit outside.

Hot Mama’s Cafe ," 12/20/2013 In all of Austin, there are some great restaurants.  But the great restaurants focus on making mediocre food even better.  The difference at Hot Mama's is the *spices!*  Good Lawd, in all of Austin (and any locale I have been to for that matter) every body uses the same spices and they concentrate on preparing a better version of the meal.  Not so at Hot Mama's!!!!  Ubiquitously named a ""cafe',"" it's a not-well-known secret that you can get delicious, completely new types of food here that is simply off-the-hook!  Everything they make is unbelievably stellar.  I am part Middle Eastern myself and I know what good mediterranean food is.  The cuisine here is BETTER than that!  This review is based on at least 20 trips to this cafe.  My favorite is the regular Persian Ararat lamb sandwich/taco and the sometimes available special lamb/sweet potato/chick pea soup.  Because of the spices in that soup--best all time soup of my life. ", pos

Hot Mama’s Cafe ," 11/4/2013 I was just visiting town for the weekend. I'm from Manhattan, where there are more coffee stops than street corners. I wouldn't say I'm a coffee expert,  but I thought I knew enough to say which cups were good and which were just ""meh"". How wrong I was...  I stayed in a condo next door to Hot Mamas Cafe. Whenever I called for a cab, I would reference the pick up location as ""next to Hot Mamas Cafe"". This always resulted in confusion. Clearly no one knew this self-proclaimed Hot Mama. I disregarded her, deciding she must be a poser and assuredly not so Hot.  One day on my vacation, I was waiting longer than normal for a taxi. I NEEDED coffee. I supposed Hot Mamas would have to suffice. I was greeted by a friendly cashier and a warm atmosphere mixed with old, classic tunes. I got the iced coffee at the cashier's recommendation. It is the first cup of coffee I have ever concerned drinking black (and I'm usually the little-bit-of-coffee-with-my-cream-and-sugar guy).  Summary: Go here. Get iced coffee.  P.S. Their breakfast pastries are also amazing. ", pos 
Hot Mama’s Cafe ," 11/1/2014 Hot Mama's catered a party last night for our organization. The food was delicious!

This place dishes it out in savory mediterranean-hippy style with great service, delicious food/coffee and a cute space.  Hot Mama's may be an ideal community venue, as a little stage, ample patio space, and hula hoops adorn the cozy indoor shop. Local art hangs from the walls, kombucha is made in-house, and vegan/gluten-free options abound.  But then there is the menu of fantastic mediterranean sandwiches, salads and soup. The food is so good and popular that I saw quite a few people ordering for their offices. (nearby warehouses are home to freelance office spaces) I love the Persian Prince, with lamb, havarti, rosemary tahini and tomato. But I'm also a huge fan of the macaroons and muffins. Seriously, I don't think I could say enough about this place.  Saving the best for last, there was the service. These sweet and friendly baristas call regulars ""mama"" or ""papa"" and run around each other in a well choreographed dance. When my sandwich couldn't be made, I got a free cookie.

Hot Mama’s Cafe ," 10/24/2012 Listed in Austin Times! My Hot Mama's experience is rather different because I this is where my dear friend and her new husband had their wedding dinner last month. The ceremony and dance party were held elsewhere, but this was our dinner stop.  We ate on the patio, which would've been more lovely had the weather been a bit warmer. Still, I see the draw completely. It's a bit shaded and private--very nice, just not when it's chilly and windy. The inside space is very clearly a small casual cafe, with naked ladies on the walls (it was sorta strange waiting in line with a 7-year old girl for the bathroom and hoping she wasn't paying attention to the artwork).  The food though. SERIOUSLY THE FOOD.  Roast lamb so tender you barely had to chew it... curry chicken... amazing sides and salads... stuffed grape leaves... couscous and rice... yum. So good. There were a ton of leftovers that they packed up nicely for my friend's parents and they brought some over to us the next day for dinner. Just as good the day after.  The staff had set up a huge buffet, which was kept up really well except (and with smiles) the whole time. The only issue was that there was no clear line or order of tables going up to the buffet so it took forever to get some food. I realize that might not really be their duty to manage the flow, but that was the only real room for improvement with the whole thing from a guest perspective.  Anyway, catering and events might not be their forte, but you'd never know it from the great food and service we had that night. ", pos

From my very first Oatmeal Cranberry cookie to the last Bacon Alma Panini I had, Hot Mama's has been stellar.  I have a few favorites but they're such favorites I've been reluctant to try other things.  The La India Panini remains victorious.  Curried chicken with cheese and chopped apples complete with chips and delicious salsa.  I usually go for a Lavender Lemonade and I never regret that decision.  The staff deserve their own separate paragraph in this little review.  They are awesome.  Friendly, inviting and genuine - truly genuine.  They always have a moment to ask you how you're doing or check in on you.  The patio spins in its very own orbit.  It is bliss sitting outside with a book or some work (a little coworker and I are very guilty of taking half-days to sit outside and work at Hot Mama's).  Plenty of tables, a great, old tree to sit beneath and pleasing landscaping to make you feel as though you're not dining next to the road.  They definitely have this mama hooked. ", pos 
Hot Mama’s Cafe ," 5/17/2012 I don't know what set Hot Mama's Cafe apart from all of the other hip/new-age cafes, the local Austin coffee shops that boast fantastically brewed beans that also happen to be local, and the abundance of gentrified East side establishments providing all who seek trendy grub and beverages with something fresh.  Alas, I dropped in early one morning to pick up a number of items to go, and I found that nearly everything was homemade. Where do they get their muffins from? They make them in-house--banana, blueberry, pomegranate appeared to be a unique combination. Were the pastries ready? Not quite; they were baking fresh! Alright; surely they utilize Counter Culture or Handsome for their beanage. No way; they use Kohana, a less common Austin roastery!  The quiche has a touch of ethnic flare to it, the crust being tossed around with curry powder, I believe. The basil, tomato, eggy goodness sat well tucked up in the nooks and crannies of the crumbly, but buttery dough. The breakfast pastry was empanada like, and the combination of tofu, potato, and the assorted veggie goodness was not bad; the crust was flaky and buttery, to boot.  They also do a fine job in cranking out some quality espresso, mine possessing a smooth smokiness without too much acidity and just the right amount of milky, weighted mouth feel.  The baklava is great. With an abundance of walnuts in the middle, the flaky piece of confectionery goodness is held together with the lightest smearing of extra sweet syrup. Dough is flaky; 'nuff said.  Hot Mama's offers up some fantastic handcrafted goodies, and the grub sits heavier than most coffee shop fare. That should sit well with you who want a bit more substance with your morning caffeine fix! ", pos

Hot Mama’s Cafe ," 9/23/2011 I want you all to know, before I even begin, that I am currently at Hot Mama's with a giant soy iced coffee, lamb and garlic lemon arawrap, and Greek salad in front of me. It's a beautiful 82 degrees out, my shoes are off, and I'm lounging on one of the ultra comfortable out door chairs under the shade of a large elm tree. I think it's pretty safe to say that this is one of the most perfect days, perfect moments, of my life. I also want you all to know that this experience was a complete accident. Riding around on bikes with my boyfriend, we decided we were hungry; our intention was to go to Bits and Druthers down the road. But me being the needy lady I am, decided I absolutely had to have some coffee before I fell off my bike in sheer exhaustion. Low and behold, some place called Hot Mama's coffee shows up around the bend and we decided to take a  quick pit stop to fulfill my java desires. Not only is this place a sweet little mediterranean heaven- the staff were sweet, suggestive, and awesome. My coffee- PERFECT. they brought us our food and the presentation was stunning. I should also explain that my man and I are both chef's, so we aren't the easiest to please. This food is off the freakin hook. Taking my first bites I felt like I was no longer in Austin, but some foreign country where food this good and unique is passed down from generation to generation and takes more than a kitchen aid, oven, and fancy cookware to make. The kind of food that stains your hands and fills the entire street up with spicy, delectable smells. As I'm writing this, I'm taking bites of this food and though it seems impossible- it just keeps getting better. Take my word for it- this is without a doubt one of Austin's best hidden gems. Check out the pictures I'm posting and see for yourself. I'm going to go back to my foodie bliss now.... Greek salad- YUM! Lemon garlic hummus and lamb arawrap Greek salad and two lamb and garlic lemon hummus arawraps. Holy crap good! ", pos

There is a pretty large food menu, with sandwiches, hummus plates, salads, etc. The sandwiches come with chips and this roasted red pepper salsa that is absolutely to die for! I also had a delicious lemon scone made in-house.  I was there for a couple of hours working and regulars came and went, chatting with the owner, creating a real local feel to the place. They also have open mic nights, hula hooping hour, and other activities most weekends.

Tried their greek salad w/ chicken; the chicken was well seasoned and nicely cooked, really liked it. But the olives in the salad were crushed and I, for one, like to bite into my kalamatas. I also had 2 of their drinks - sunrise - refreshing and the italian cream soda - meh, it was ok.  All in all, not a bad experience but not great either.

Hot Mama’s Cafe , 9/7/2010 Updated review Props to the Owner Mama of Hot Mama's! She contacted me after my lacking experience the first time and invited me back to see that they really took my review to heart and valued my business and support.  It's a super casual place that has a awesome patio that we will frequent once it cools down. They also have a super friendly staff. But the real reason you go to a place is because things taste good and service is good right... OK I'll get to it then.  I had the Persian Lamb sandwich and Lavender Lemonade. Hubs had the Bacon Havarti. All were big winners but the Lamb sammie was sooo great. My hubs is from Iceland where lamb is serious business and I wasn't expecting awesome but it really was just that- completely awesome. Fresh tomato and a flavorful sauce was on top (be warned it is messy but worth a good stain or two). The Lemonade was very sweet but it was a great twist with the lavender and wasn't overdone (it could have tasted like soap but instead it was just super refreshing).  Well done Mama! Thanks for making me feel valued and for creating awesome food that will keep us coming back. , pos

Hot Mama’s Cafe ," 3/12/2011 I like this place.  I like it a lot.  And that's simply speaking to their coffee.  I have rehearsals near Hot Mama's and so whenever I give myself enough time, I'll always drop in for an Americano right before.  Why is that?  Why not head to the more convenient coffee shops closer to the highway?  Well, because this just might be the best Americano I've come across.  Hot Mama's is truly one of the better coffee shops in Austin.  And it's actually for their coffee.  Now why don't I love the place?  The problem is I've never spent much time there--usually grabbing my drinks to go.  But the eclectic inside is very lovely and from what I've seen the much larger outside looks like a great place to work or relax on a nice day, so I'll definitely be making a day trip in the near future to get the full Hot Mama's experience.

Hot Mama’s Cafe ," 1/30/2010 1 check-in Listed in Austin Coffee Shops It's as cozy as it is tiny: this diminutive coffee spot on East 6th was my camp out spot for a meeting this week, and I came away pleased. Staff was friendly and eager, and seemed to be genuinely having fun. In this day of semi-aloof baristas, I'll take some shiny and happy, thanks.  I rounded out my italian soda with a baklava (they have a $4 rule if you user your debit card), and was glad I did. That dessert was nearly as sweet as the staff, and my guess is that the rumor of the new owner re-claiming the business from the previously owned folks is a welcome one. They're re-opening house is this weekend, and that it'll be packed isn't much of a surprise, as the place is teeny tiny. But perhaps a pleased grin will be. ", pos 
Hot Mama’s Cafe ," 5/5/2011 This is one of my favorite places for coffee - I enjoy getting their toddy (cold-pressed ice coffee), and the oat toffee crunch cookies (HUGE, $3) are super delicious.  I've only had a few of their menu items, like the veggie bagel and the hummus plate, but I've enjoyed them - and my mother loved the quiche.  I always appreciate the mostly friendly staff - I expect(and appreciate) being pulled out of my grump whenever I come here! ", pos 
Hot Mama’s Cafe ," 10/24/2012 Great place to get your caffeine fix, grab a bite, and do a little work.

Hot Mama’s Cafe ," 7/7/2010 What a great patio! I went to a hooping event today. I only had the lavender lemonade but that was really good. Served in a large glass with lots of ice, it was just the ticket for my frequent hooping breaks. The patio has raised platforms here and there that were perfect for our hooping selves.  I will go back to sample the food as well. The barista/owner was very welcoming. I think that says a lot for a place. The inside looked comfy-cozy but we were out on the patio. Something about large hoops twirling all over the place... ", pos

Hot Mama’s Cafe ," 3/28/2009 I must have missed the outdoor patio everytime I drove by because I had no idea there was one. The main reason I go to coffee shops is just to get out of the apt or to read a book in good weather, so one of the main criteria I judge coffee shops by is their outdoor seating. Furthermore, the difference between a good and great coffee shop is the comfort of their furniture. More shops should realize that splurging on decent furniture is a very wise investment (lookin' at you Caffe Medici). I was pleasantly surprised by Mama's patio chairs. Chic AND comfortable. A+ I went to try their coffee but was swayed by the tea. They have a small but eclectic collection of drinks - mate, Mexican mocha, lots of teas, hot & cold, and some interesting-looking beers I've never heard of.  As others have pointed out, this area of E 6th is quickly turning into an alley of high-priced condos. I'm calling it the Yuppie Corridor - between about Chicon & Pedernales. The area is odd because it seems so isolated and desolate. There's really not many people around - at least not when I've been down here. I assume most of these condos are still waiting to be filled. I'd seen Hot Mama's before, riding my bike down this way, but the strip mall atmosphere was a put off. From the street it looks like just another average coffee shop. But I decided to try the place solely based on other reviews. ", pos 
Hot Mama’s Cafe ," 11/6/2013 I feel like this place will become a new obsession of mine. I work out down the street at eastside Austin elite, I was absolutely starving after class and randomly pulled over at the first thing I saw. Everything in their menu sounds divine. I went with the bacon apple alma (not sure of real name) it was just incredible!!! I can't wait to try all of their sandwiches. Plus the interior is so stinking cute, kind of like you are home, comfy and cozy! ", pos 
Hot Mama’s Cafe ," 1/11/2012 An instant deal on Living Social clued me into this coffee shop/ eatery. They have house-made kombucha (I tried the lemon/ lavender) ($3) and rotating specials. I tried the green goddess taco special with soup ($8). The tacos consisted of chickpeas, feta, greens, and basil hummus on corn tortillas, and the soup was a lamb and collard green concoction. I wish the girl at the counter would have told me how similar they were in ingredients but I am glad I tried both, so no big deal. I will definitely be back! ", pos

Hot Mama’s Cafe ," 3/27/2009 Nice new coffee place in what will soon become condo canyon in East 6th Street.  Hot Mama's has more character than you'd expect from its location. The indoor part is quite small - maybe only 6 cafe-type round tables for two.  But don't sit inside - enjoy the huge outdoor courtyard (with a great shade tree) all done up in industrial sheet metal theme - really cool and chic.  Don't forget to look up to see two of the biggest suspended light fixtures you've ever seen.  Sitting in this courtyard with an espresso and frowning as you text on your iPhone will up your hip-o-meter by 6 points, minimum.  The cappuccinos are lovely, and mine came with an exceptionally stiff foam top, just how I like it.  I didn't get any food, but I was impressed by the menu of real food offerings - panninis, salads, and so on, with an emphasis on middle eastern dishes (baba, hummus, etc.) Someone got a Greek salad at a table next to me - looked fresh and big.  One thing that caught my eye that I will try out next time is the ham & muenster croissant dusted with powdered sugar.  Free wifi is available, although you have to go through the hassle of creating an account (password, username, etc) --  totally stupid for a one-time event, but whatever. Just make it free and unlocked - what's the big deal?  Barista was really friendly, but as he was a he, I assume he wasn't the eponymous hot mama.  So who is? ", pos 
Hot Mama’s Cafe ," 5/22/2009 I stopped in here today for a quick meeting and this place was empty. A bit of a shame. There is a pretty decent menu with good prices and good coffee drinks. There is a large patio outside as well as seating for about 20-25 inside. Staff was friendly and this cafe was clean. I know they have Wi-Fi here, but not a single customer was using it...a bit refreshing for the freeloaders that sit in cafe's for six hours and have a $2.00 cup of coffee. ", pos

Not too sweet, smooth espresso, and while I was there he whipped up a batch of blueberry banana muffins from scratch. I totally wanted more than one, and I got the first one hot out of the oven.

But more than all of that, the staff is all very genuinely nice and inviting.  From the first time I visited this establishment, I felt welcomed, and I knew I had found my neighborhood spot.  Now I'm there at least once a week.  It never ceases to amaze me how far a smile and a little kindness can go.  Even if you live across town, if you're having a bad day, drive over to Hot Mama's, get a Hot Mama Latte (it's ridiculously delicious), and relax for a few minutes.

I have forgotten the drive, the claustrophobia.   I love the  core-tin steel booths and tables, the trees, the fountain, and the quiet.

The Steeping Room ," 11/5/2016 I love this place for its affordable prices, reliable customer service, cute presentation and quality tea. I frequent it quite often due to my anglophile tendencies -- I took a semester Abroad in England. I am always on the look out for the best tea, scones, and clotted cream. The scones here great! The currant sells out often. I can recommend the cranberry scone and the rosemary/cheddar scone. It's moist yet flakey.  The tea selection here is extensive and it really depends on your taste. My only complaint about this place is---I believe that clotted cream should really be served at room temperature. They serve it cold here and its incredibly hard to spread without breaking the scone.  There tea sandwiches are awesome and you can do it with crust off! There's free wifi ---but you are only allowed to stay for 2 hours.  Pro Tip: They also have a location at the Domain --- that sometimes is less busy. ", pos 
The Steeping Room ," 10/30/2016 Tried this place for Sunday brunch.  One of the few places in the area that didn't have a wait.  Extensive gf offerings, sweet and savory.  Had the Monte Cristo on gf rice bread and a carrot cupcake for dessert.  Everything was delish and service was fast and attentive. The sandwich was stuffed with turkey, ham and cheese.  We added a fried egg and bacon. It was moist on the inside and crunchy on the outside. The carrot cake was super moist and not too sweet.  My husband didn't even know that it was gf.  Would def come back and try other things.  The only downside was they didn't have a liquor license so no mimosas, which is a must have for brunch (in my opinion). Gf Carrot Cupcake GF Monte Cristo with fried egg ", pos 
The Steeping Room ," 10/16/2016 The Monte Cristo was a little odd. It seemed more like a coque madam with melted cheese on one side.. the bread was weirdly spongey, like the egg hadn't cooked through entirely. Also the two meats were split up on the sandwich so one side was turkey, the other ham. My fingers were already glistening with grease so I didn't mind fixing it on my own, but it was a little wild. Also where is the jam? The side salad made little sense, a little spring mix does not a salad make. Skip this one.  Saving grace? The almond cake. Rich, sweet with just the right amount of crumble top.  I'll be back, after eyeing the menu a second time, I think it would be worth another trip. ", neutral

The Steeping Room ," 6/7/2016 1 check-in We were visiting from Houston and needed a brunch place to hit up before we drove back. This area was recommended by and neighbouring our Airbnb. I thought the veggie soysage with the hot cheddar scone and eggs were filling enough! I asked for the eggs to be a soft scrambled, and much to my surprise, they added a nice slab of melty cheese on it. Nice touch.  The soysage did not taste like ""fake meat"" at all. Y'know, the chemical kinda taste? And the scone was small but delish. We were seated promptly (oddly enough, the hostess stand was right at the middle of the restaurant) and service was great. They have a shelf full of a plethora of teas and tea gadgets. Neat place! Cheddar scone, soft scrambled eggs and veggie soysage. Nom nom! ", pos 
The Steeping Room ," 5/20/2016 1 check-in Very good tea spot in Austin. I love that they first give you the clear option of lounge seating or full-service without any sort of confusion. The decor is also quite nice - modern, but warm and charming. Lots of natural lighting.  We chose the full service and ordered the Century Oaks Tea Service, which is sort of a full-English tea service - comes with a pot of tea, a scone, tea cookies, a slice of tea cake, and two tea sandwiches,. In terms of tea selection, there is a *TON* of high-quality choices. We got a reserve black tea, which turned out to be quite nice (smooth and balanced, with a more adventurous, grassy finish). The food accompaniments were also all top-notch. The tea cookies were tiny little sweet treats that were perfectly-sized considering their sweetness. The scone was a cheddar-rosemary scone, and it came with clotted cream and raspberry jam; this was truly the star of the tea service. I loved the scone's savory flavor with the not-to-sweet jam and the richness of the clotted cream; excellent combination. The tea cake was an orange tea cake with this candied orange icing; while the cake itself was moist and flavorful, we did feel that the icing was far too sweet. Finally, we got the lemon scallion and romesco sandwiches; both went perfectly well with the entire tea service.  All in all, a delightful experience. They seem to have a great selection of food and teas. Highly recommend this place for lunch or late afternoon treat! Tofu Napa Rolls Century Oaks Tea Service Page 1 of the insanely long tea menu!

I also enjoyed purchasing some loose tea while I was there.  I took home jasmine green.  One of my favs.  Unfortunately, the dinner was less perfect .  The $4 hummus and crackers was fine but nothing special.  Looked and tasted like  what I put out at home.  We split a Tao of Green salad with salmon.  The salmon was so tiny split, it was two small bites.  We ordered another side of salmon. The salmon was dry and cold.  The salad was abundant (even my half of the salad), fresh and rather surprisingly bland since it has cilantro in it, but reasonably tasty.  The service was inattentive and they weren't that busy.  I think I'll stick to breakfast and lunch at steeping room.  My breakfast and lunch experiences have been really nice. Yummy dining choices! Excellent tea selection. Today's chose green jasmine!

The Steeping Room ," 2/7/2016 It is really frustrating when you know the food is good, healthy and fresh but you cannot get it.  We arrived yesterday a little after eleven, about eleven fifteen, and were seated outside. Shortly after that two guys were seated next to us. Their waiter came and went and they had water before we had seen our waiter. We had plenty of time to look over the menu when Lyndsey arrived. She offered to take our drink order, but we told her we were ready to order. It went down hill from there.  Rory ordered the strata, her favorite, and an Earl Grey Latte. I ordered the  Pork Bahn Mi and A Chai Latte with a side of honey. Suzy ordered the strata-she had never been here, so we had recommended it. The waiter said they only had one strata left, so Suzy looked to the menu to decide what to order. Lindsy offered to turn in our coffee order and return. We know how they run out of strata so we asked her to make sure Rory got the last piece. She disappeared.  Tick tock. Finally we asked the waiter next to us to send over our waiter. Lindsy returned without our drinks or water and told us that all the strata was gone. (maybe cause you took too long?) So now Rory had to re-decide what to get, and the waitress turned to me as if I had never ordered. So I re-ordered. Then Suzy ordered breakfast, only to be told they were no longer serving breakfast (maybe cause you took too long?). Anyway, Rory finally orders the BLAT and Suzy orders the Pork Tenderloin sandwich.  The waiter brought our coffee without the honey, and then our waters without the honey. Tick Tock. We sit back and wait THIRTY minutes and now our neighbors are half way through their food and we haven't seen Lindsy in quite some time so we stop an employee who happens to be the manager on duty, Laura, and we ask her to check on our food. She came back to apologetically tell us the order has JUST NOW been turned in and she offers anything to hold us over-soup, scone, more coffee.  Laura saved our day. When we got the food, it was spectacular. The pork in my sandwich was tender, the veggies were fresh, and the bread was crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside. The fresh green salad with balsamic dressing was delicious. Everyone loved their food. The Chai was a  little weak, but Rory's early grey was perfect. We never saw Lindsy again.  Lindsy, everyone has a bad day, but if this is a common occurrence, please find another job. You're doing the Steeping Room a great disservice with your lack of service. Our meal was generously comped by Laura. Thank you. ", neutral

The friendliness of the servers at The Steeping Room definitely stood out!  Not only was the service excellent, but the food and tea were also very delicious.  It was a memorable experience and I'm glad we got the chance to try it out before heading back to Cali.  Luckily a couple of my friends in my group were tea connoisseurs so I let them choose the teas.  My friend selected the Yame Gyokuro green tea and also the ""Milk"" Oolong.  Both teas smelled heavenly and I really enjoyed the feeling of awareness I felt when sipped on them.  I even brought some of lovely Yame Gyokuro home with me.  As far as food, we decided to share everything.  I love sharing with friends so we can try several dishes.  Below is what we ordered: - Zen Tea Service - napa rolls with tofu/ walnut cucumber, edamame, matcha dusted vegan chocolate cupcake (subbed a vegan cupcake with the brownie).  Loved the fresh rolls and the cupcake was to die for! - Moroccan Spiced Carrot Hummus Tea Sandwich with shaved fennel and scallion with Tao of Green Salad - this was delicious.  Enjoyed the hummus! - Vegan BAT - tempeh bacon, arugula and tomato with basil veganaise with cashew caesar.  This was super tasty with locally made tempeh.

I even called the waiter back over to ask him how these simple ingredients could taste like THAT.  Also shared some scones with clotted cream and Ceylon (Sri Lankan) tea with a friend.

The Steeping Room ," 1/2/2016 1 check-in So Tea is a thing. Not exactly my thing, but I am going to display my objectivity in this review. The Steeping Room is a bit unique. Tea, otherwise, is such an antiquated meal and tradition. And ""High Tea""? Forget about it. I would never get that high. I have an Aunt in London who wanted to show off the British Tea experience. She recommended we all dress up in top hats and morning jackets and spend 100 pounds per person to do it. Talk about a pretentious scone. I am surprised it would even deign to have itself lathered up in clotted cream.  Anyway, this is not the Steeping Room. The Steeping Room is the Austin version of the same. Casual, yet not cheap. You can expect to spend $20pp for your tea service of which there are several varieties. And if you wish to go a-la-carte, there is a decent selection of items from which to construct a small-mid sized meal.  The food gets as dietary conscience as you like. Are you gluten free? They got that covered. Are you on an auto-immune protocol diet? Check! Vegan candida cleansing? They got your back! So, flexibility is the name of the game. And the execution is good. Flavors combine in a very favorable way at the Steeping Room.  On to the teas. The selection is well thought through.  And the staff? Totally friendly and helpful. It is a godsend for the clean eating set. And I dare say old chap, it even works decently well for someone who doesn't give a damn about what they but in their bodies. ", pos

For those seeking clean eating, gluten free, vegan options, this place is for you. For those who could care less, the food is good quality and tasty. I love, love, love that the basic salad offered has a lot of red and leafy green lettuce. Their balsamic has a nutty base (cashew I think) and not too tangy.  I was immensely impressed that despite how busy they were, there was a server who greeted me not long after I entered the door and explained the process (how to order if to-go or dining in. This was especially important as I entered through the street entrance which is furthest from the counter/hostess station.  I felt very comfortable to sit and peruse the menu and order in the time I needed. The cashier was also immensely friendly and helpful.  Plus, the food was delish, and they included a checklist showing that my order was checked before sent out.

The Steeping Room , 10/18/2015 OMG! Try the Chai Spiced French Toast!!!!! I got it with the gluten-free rice bread. I had my reservations about the bread because I'm not the type to eat at places that are vegan or gluten-free but it was AMAZING!!!! I especially loved that it was served with fresh fruit. So good! , pos 
The Steeping Room ," 5/24/2016 Very good place. Relaxed vibe. Casual. Busy at lunch, but not too busy at dinner time. Food is good; not amazing, but good. Tons of tea options. I once ordered a Bahn Mi sandwich on which the pork was less well cooked than I like it (but totally safe to eat). The manager took the Bahn Mi off of my bill even though it was not the kitchen's fault. Great customer service in that case. ", pos 
The Steeping Room ," 11/20/2013 8 check-ins Listed in The Amy D List - ""Royalty"", The Ashley S List - ""Delightful"", The Alison L List - ""Amazing"", The Same Places Ain't Always Alike..., The Jenny L List - ""Until Yelp Do Us Part"" It occurs to me among Alison L, Ashley S, Amy D, and Jenny L - the four Yelpers I've name-dropped so often I've had to make their own lists - the only restaurant experience we actually share in common is the Steeping Room. I'm pretty sure that's significant in some way. Incidentally, I'm as significant to those four ladies as much as their dry cleaner, or maybe a good HEB cashier. But we've had some fun times together at various Yelp events.    What makes the Steeping Room unique is how it evokes the Rashomon effect, because it appears to represent different things to different people. I used to think it was our local vestige of Dallas, the upscale alternative to the usual coffeehouse suspects. But now I'm starting to think it may be the most underrated vegan & vegetarian place in town - you really can vegetize any menu item here and eat meatless pretty well.  From their lunchtime BLT's substituted with tofu & tempeh, to a delightful tea service with scones & cakes & jams I randomly shared one morning, I've always had a fun time at the Steeping Room. And always make resos for lunch - Prada to the left of me & flip-flops to the right - why wait to be stuck in the middle with you? The ""Scone Set"" @ $10.75. Comes with a pot of tea. The scones are superb. This was a cranberry walnut & candied ginger. Yum! The ""Morning Meal"" @ $8.75 with fruit instead of mixed greens. You can veggie/vegan pretty much anything here, don't forget. 8-11am Breakfast at TSR: The ""Mushroom Tarragon Omelet"" @ $8.95. Not bad. ", pos 
The Steeping Room ," 12/16/2014 Confession: I don't know the first thing about tea. I know that sometimes it tastes grassy and I know Lipton doesn't count as the real deal, but that's about it. Luckily the Steeping Room caters to people like me. These waitresses know their stuff and they're more than happy to talk/guide you through their intimidating wine-list-length tea menu.  I'd tell you what I got, but I literally don't know what it was. Something with ginger. It didn't taste grassy. I was a happy camper.  Also, those scones are delish. We got two: the rosemary and the ginger, with honey butter. They're soft (none of that stale bakery texture that Americans sometimes think scones have...I'm looking at you, Starbucks). These are the best scones I've had, outside of the ones I make from scratch:)  I wasn't a big fan of the decor of this place, but aside from that the steeping room is a great alternative to my usual coffee shop visits!

The Steeping Room ," 8/3/2015 Who knew that there was such thing as a TEA Happy Hour? I mean I definitely didn't, this is a wonderful option for our health conscious who don't drink or even for those who are just looking for a day without any alcohol to just chat with their friends. They have plenty of options to choose from for your vegetarian friends to someone who might want something a little more substantial. Also there's a massive list of different types of teas, it's also a cute place to plan a tea party. They are really onto something here at The steeping room since I think it's probably one of the only tea houses in Austin and I really love it and will continue coming back. Service is always great, the food is great, and the environment is relaxing (most of the time) and inviting! ", pos 
The Steeping Room ," 6/13/2015 When I first walked in I was greeted by a display of delicious baked goods. I tried the cranberry and walnut scone! Really flaky and soft! I think it was the perfect amount of sweetness because I don't really like things that are too sweet. Ordered the pork medallion sandwich and tomato soup. The pork medallion sandwich was really freaking good! Very tender and the sauce complemented the meat extremely well. I couldn't really taste the coconut in the tomato coconut soup, but the texture of the tomato soup was amazing. We also ordered the seasonal hummus which was pumpkin flavored!! ", pos

The Steeping Room ," 10/11/2015 On a whim my girlfriend and I packed up our dogs and headed up north Lamar to go grab some food and tea at the steeping room. We show up at 4:30, without knowledge that the establishment closes at 5 on sundays, and tentatively asked to be attended to outside. The staff was very attentive and helpful. The menu was large but not intimidating. The vegetarian option on nearly every dish was a huge plus. The tea and coffee selection was right up our alley. With the kind staff and the good food I was happy enough. After placing our order we waited about 5 minutes for a delicious edemame appetizer then an additional 15 minutes for two delicious sandwiches each came with a lightly dressed mixed green salad. The worst part of our experience was that our dogs were being very misbehaved... but that is nobody's fault but ours. Thank you guys! ", pos

It has an interesting feel inside but mostly tea themed as you would imagine.    The food was pretty good, as I didn't know what to expect, but we had breakfast sandwiches and tea.  The tea was a little weak but they were nice enough to remake it and let us steep it ourselves.    The staff here is a really cool and it seems like a good spot to hide out and do some work or just relax while drinking some tea and having some snacks.  Its a bit hidden away in the shopping center its in but if you can find Starbucks you are close by.  The prices on tea are pretty decent too but try a few before buying to be sure you like what you purchase. ", pos 
The Steeping Room ," 10/31/2014 4 check-ins I'm a huge tea drinker, and since I've found the most delicious English Breakfast I've ever had, from here, I'm hooked.  I finally went here to get a bag of loose and decided to try the breakfast. I got the basic B-fast sandy. Add ham and tomato, delicious! Simple and filling. Combine with my tea, I'm happy happy happy.  This is where they earn the stars, tea and food is awesome.  Oh, and staff might not always know tea, but everyone is wonderfully friendly and sweet.  I recently went by to eat with the hub's, and we stayed to consume the awesomeness. The sandwich was the same, good and yummy. We ordered a pot of tea this time, meaning they brewed it. I'll state that I like my coffee and tea both strong, apparently very strong. Our pot tasted watery, really watery.  I asked for more tea to brew it stronger, the pot doesn't have a sieve, instead, they brew and bring just the liquid to the table. (I've never had a place do this, can't say I prefer it). The waiter then came back and mentioned they'll just brew another pot, as brewing longer = bitter. (Her words). I disagree personally, I guess I've been doing it my way for long enough that what they say is bitter doesn't seem to be a problem for me.  So, they re-brew, and ta-dah! we've got tea.  Beautiful, wonderful, tea.   The other waiter came by and mentions that they brew medium, as everyone likes their tea different.( I think it's probably better to just leave the steeping to the customer IMO.) We now know what to ask for, a stronger brew (which is just brewing with a higher quantity of leaves they say). Ok, got it, now I know.  It's still wonderful, with a little kink.  I did purchase a new tea this last time, untasted. Turkish Delight. It was based on a few recommendations a staff member offered. I do not usually enjoy any teas with citurs added or other 'natural flavors'. It's a blend of green and black. I actually really like it. Doesn't need sugar, which I love! And it's a nice finish. Now, this is one I wouldn't want too strong, it's very flavorful.  I'm very excited about this place and I'll be back for sure. ", pos

The Steeping Room ," 2/9/2016 1 check-in As much as I love the tea selection here, can't really recommend this place. It is pretty much impossible to get a server to come communicate with you. Once you have ordered they ignore you. It's even impossible to get a check here to pay. I would give it 5 stars if I could just get any server to realise them I am trying to give them money for goods and services and I can't do that without ordering. I was literally here for the ENTIRETY of happy hour and I could never get the server to acknowledge me to order. I should have sat in the self service lounge.  The food is also not worth the price. I really appreciate the gluten free and vegan options, but most things are prohibitively expensive for the amount of food you receive. Some of the fare is delightful and really interesting but some items can be bland. The atmosphere is rather loud. The play the music loud enough that everyone has to raise their voice to hear their friends. It's very migraine inducing for a tea house.   But it is clean, and at night they put candles on the tables and lower the lights a bit which is really lovely. The cleaners used also don't set off my sensitive nose or block the delightful smell coming from the kitchen.  The location is also dreadful to get in and out of, which isn't their fault. This is just a warning that it's hard to get to. ", neutral

I really feel I can relax here and even my husband knows to take me her for an immediate de-stress effect.  I HIGHLY recommend the clotted cream and strawberry jam with Currant scones. Don't be stingy with it the flavor profile of a good thick layer is worth the extra calories and a salad for dinner!

I was excited to see smoked salmon with latkes on the menu since these are some of my favorite things food-wise.  Unfortunately, the latkes were burnt and somehow still overly-oily.

The tea was fantastic (I had the peach oolong), and the food was extremely delicious. I had the morning breakfast service that comes with two eggs, bacon, potatoes, fruit, a scone, a pot of tea and some tea cookies. Potatoes were excellent, eggs were a little undercooked for my taste, bacon was cooked well.. but the superstar was the fruit. Raspberries, pear slices, apple slices, blackberries, blueberries, banana, and pineapple. All of it so fresh and flavorful. The berry spelt scone also rocked with some clotted cream and jam.  My S.O. had the B.A.T.E. - bacon, arugula, tomato, and egg on ciabatta. He scarfed it down along with the house hot sauce that he loved.  Vegan, vegetarian, and GF options.  Why four stars? The tables for two are tiny and it gets really crowded with two pots of tea and plates. Also, they are really close together. Maybe it wouldn't have been so bad if the conversation next to us hadn't been so annoying. Totally ruined the ambiance. B.a.t.e Morning breakfast service ", pos

The Steeping Room ," 2/5/2015 6 check-ins Let me start by saying that since I was introduced to the Salted Toffee Cookie, no other cookie exists! It's like you died and went to cookie heaven. While there, you see Cookie Monster and he tries to take your cookie and you stab him in the hand and say ""No, Cookie Monster, This is my cookie!"" It's good enough for even a dream sequence!  Wait staff is friendly and knowledgeable, which is good because there are, what seems like 1,367,468 types of tea to choose from and having a helping hand in deciding is very helpful.  Food for me is good, but there are only a few things that I would consider putting in my mouth, ie. Kale, tempeh, tofu nuggets etc.  My friends that do like that stuff say it's amazing, so we'll go with that.  Lastly, if you go around lunch prepare to fight to the death for parking, it gets a little cut-throat! Otherwise, relax, sit back and enjoy that tea and Salted Toffee Cookie.

Best I've had in Austin. I can always find great gluten free options. The brunch is also great for gluten free options. Always impressed. I don't have a favorite dish yet.

The Steeping Room ," 1/15/2015 So today I tried this place. I have been in Austin since September and it has been on to do list. So, let us start with the entrance when I walked in I had no clue that there was even a hostess. She was standing behind a half wall, I went to the counter to look at the menu and the lady behind the counter asked if I was ordering to go. I informed her that I actually wanted to eat in and she pointed me to the ""hostess"". She  just stared at me until I said, ""just 1"". She informs me that there was a 15 to 20 minute wait; even though there were open tables and only two people ahead of me. She informed me that the "" lounges"" was open sitting, but was not served by a server. I was informed that I would need to order at the counter and serve myself. I had planned to do that from the start!!!  The young man behind the counter was very helpful. I selected the Buddha Bowl with collard greens, red rice, sweet potatoes, and white beans. I was NOT expecting for it to taste like it did. There was absolutely NO seasoning on any of the items in the bowl. It tasted like they just boiled the items in water and then stuck them in a bowl. I selected the sesame lime sauce for the bowl it had weird taste to it. I kept telling myself while eating, ""you eat for fuel, not taste"". The only part of my meal that I actually enjoyed was my pot of Jasmine tea.  If I ever go back it will only be for tea because what I experienced of the food was a waste if time. I am only giving it 3 stars because of the guy behind the counter; I think his name was Ravi and the pot of tea. ", neutral 
The Steeping Room ," 10/6/2015 This is one of the best places to eat in Austin if you're celiac. They will clean the preparation surface for you.

Ask for extra sriracha and cilantro.  The majority of the waitstaff is super, but one time, we did have a girl that just seemed like she hated her job, or maybe was having an awful day (at 8am).  Ooh, and the BAT sandwich (bacon, arugula and tomato with basil mayo) is fantastic. Vegan style, and they make their own tempeh bacon that is cold smoked.  Damn it, people, you're a big pile of genius.  And that super bacon? Freaking gluten free, too. And vegan basil mayonnaise? It's so simple, but I want to marry the person at Steeping Room who came up with that, and then divorce them, because that's what I do.  They also have pastries and muffins and whatnots, all clearly marked for specialty diets.  They have tea. Buuuuuut, I don't care.  Why not all the stars? The restaurants temperature is so weird.

The Steeping Room ," 1/3/2014 1 check-in Listed in 2014 Yelp 100 Challenge HOLLA!!!!, SUGAR?!!! WHERE?!, Breakfast: the most important meal of the day So fun fact about myself. At one point in life I was a hardcore coffee drinker and drank around 6 cups a day. I had a major caffeine overload in undergrad after pulling 3 all nighters in a row and could barely finish my last exam because my hands were shaking so badly. Since then I've stopped drinking coffee BUT now I'm pretty much addicted to Diet Coke and tea.... out of the frying pan and into the fire much?  So personally I really like breakfast blend and Earl Grey teas. My favorite tea blend is the St. Regis blend which they serve at Afternoon tea at the St. Regis (hmm reminds me to review them). I have a theory that it's a mix between breakfast blend and Earl Grey.... anyway back to the point. I stopped by the Steeping Room because I was told it was the Austin equivalent of a tea service. With that in mind we ordered a pot of the Breakfast blend.  Interestingly enough this place is vegan so I was a bit taken aback when I was offered my choice of almond milk or 2% with my tea.... interesting. I chose both just to see what it would be like. I'm used to actually taking cream versus milk with my tea. It allows me to add less while still mellowing out the harsh tones of a black blend. The Breakfast blend was solid, a great early morning starter tea.  For food we ordered the Scone set and chose the walnut-cranberry scone and the spiced apricot scone. We also had clotted cream with it (it comes with strawberry preserves). I ordered the mushroom tarragon omelette with the greens and my companion ordered the morning meal with fruit. The scones were great. They were soft, buttery, and paired beautifully with the cream and preserves. My Omelette was stellar as well. Here's a tip: the omelette comes with a substantial amount of goat cheese which is great if you like goat cheese and extremely generous of them but personally it was a bit much for me. It's just something to note.  Eventually we decided to order a second pot of tea and took our server's suggestion. To be honest I felt like our server was new as she didn't seem very familiar with the tea blends or the contents of the menu. She recommended the Christmas blend. I guess the best way to put it is to say that this kind of tea isn't up my alley. There's a certain kind of person who prefers slightly bitter black teas (breakfast blends, earl greys, jasmine tea, etc) and there's a certain kind of person who prefers sweet, minty, fruity blends. This was a pretty sweet, minty, and very cinnamon-heavy tea. Would I have chosen it? No. Was it bad? Not really. Would I get it again? No.  For what it offers this place is great for Austin. It had a nice ambiance and it's distinctive in Austin's varied food scene. I'd like to come back sometime and try their regular lunch. Scone set Mushroom Tarragon Omelette ", pos

Went with the Jasmine Green tea which was so good I even got one to go when I left! For lunch I had the Vegan Tofu Tempeh Bacon Sandwich. It was the best tempeh bacon sandwich I have had! And I have tried quite a lot of them. Most places overdo the flavoring of tempeh and tofu but The Steeping Room really got it right. It was light and had the perfect amount of flavor and the side Cashew Ceasar salad was amazing too. I would have that salad for my entire meal.  I will definitely be recommending this place and becoming a regular. Although they probably don't need the recommendation because the restaurant was full by the time I left!

Not the case here at all! I had an excellent experience here with a combination of the food and service and of course great company.  We sat in Jennifer's section (pretty sure that was her name, it's been two weeks) who only works at this (Lamar) location on Wednesdays. She was patient, knowledgeable about the menu and restaurant, fun to talk to but also let us do our own thing, attentive to our needs with refills etc. and just an overall awesome human being! Since it was my first time, she even bought us our dessert, which is such a sweet thing to do!!!  That tea selection is heavenly and I got a little overwhelmed because I wanted 10 different ones and most places don't even have 5 options let alone 50!  Foodwise, I felt like I had a ""When Harry Met Sally"" moment in the restaurant, except my foodgasm was real! I'm still dreaming about their red lentil soup....OMG so yummy, I want that everyday for the rest of my life now, move over bfast tacos! We also got their special for the day which was a chicken and rice and probably the best chicken and rice i've had (sorry mum). Was flavourful and zesty, the chicken was cooked perfectly, the rice was the right amount of fluff and softness. The best part was that It gave the effect of feeling like you ate super healthy because it's not greasy and you feel light afterwards. Ohhh that dessert, that chocolate caramel cake should be for 4people, but the two of us gobbled it down and I knew I'd want more. Also felt light for a cake so rich!  TELL ME HOW YOU DO IT?!  Just stop what you're doing and go to the steeping room, thank me later. ", pos 
The Steeping Room , 2/22/2015 1 check-in Great selection of teas to purchase for home as well as a variety of both coffee & tea to brew while there. Highly recommend the chocolate chipotle chai! Chocolate chipotle chai , pos 
The Steeping Room ," 9/6/2015 2 check-ins I go here almost every week for my masala chai fix. The wait time for a table can range up to an hour or more on weekends, an online reservation is recommended around lunch time. On weekday nights, I've not had to wait for a table. The staff is always friendly but service can be quite slow during busy hours, since the kitchen is quite small. For Sunday brunch, I usually get the gravlax and latkes if I get there early enough (they run out of it!). I also enjoy the croque monsieur, Monte Cristo sandwiches and the Bangkok daily bowl. For dessert, I either get the seasonal creme brulee or the matcha dusted brownie. ", pos 
The Steeping Room ," 3/15/2014 1 check-in Went here for lunch today with Lauren H. and baby C. Called ahead and made a reservation, which I would advise doing as the place is small and we still had to wait a few minutes for our table. Once seated, we placed our order. I got a pot of the hibiscus tea and it was delicious...and since it was raining on and off outside, perfect for the weather. I ordered the rustica salad, which was plentiful and flavorful. Lauren ordered the chicken salad sandwich. The portions are healthy and the service was superb. Certainly a great way to have a ladies lunch this rainy afternoon! Rustica salad ", pos 
The Steeping Room ," 10/25/2015 A few complaints about a wonderful little restaurant:  The TBLT (Turkey, Bacon, Lettuce & Tomato) sandwich isn't very good, partly because the turkey is tasteless, but mainly because the tomato slices are too thick, there's way too much mayonnaise, AND the romaine leaves include the rib, the thick part of the center - all of which, predictably, makes the whole sandwich fall apart. BLTs (+ turkey) are an easily mastered art.  The Strata is not always completely cooked.  The Masala Bowl is disappointing. ", pos 
The Steeping Room ," 10/22/2015 I got the Chipotle Chocolate Chai tea and it was amazing. My tea sandwiches (pork) were so savory and I've never had fresher greens in my salad. The service was wonderful, all the servers and workers were so helpful and happy. It was a very peaceful atmosphere. I got some Jasmine Green Tea leaves to brew at home and am very happy with it. ", pos 
The Steeping Room , 6/11/2015 Same great tea and food as their Domain location but roomier and with closer and easier parking. I especially love their pine nut plum scones with jam or clotted cream. The one downside is the huge windowed front facing Lamar which is great on a cloudy but when sunny it fills the restaurant such that you have squint in almost any seat. , pos 
The Steeping Room , 8/14/2015 This place is amazing! It's one of my favorite Austin spots to hit! Everyone is totally great and on top of helping their customers. I recommend this place to anyone looking for a nice spot , pos 
The Steeping Room ," 9/20/2015 I come here when I visit my friend in Austin for a fun place with lots of yummy options. It gets 4 stars for having great food, but I will say I don't think it's all entirely fairly priced, and the service is pretty irregular. The waitstaff is pleasant but not super attentive or responsive. We ordered a tea set to split between us and were only brought one tea cup... and it took about 10 minutes for my friend to get a second cup. But, if you don't mind it, the food is still super tasty and the atmosphere is bright and chatty. ", pos 
The Steeping Room ," 12/7/2014 1 check-in After noticing many friends have come here and really enjoyed it, I decided to take a couple of out of town friends here for brunch.  It was definitely a great choice.  Having it been the first time here it was a little confusing between counter service and table service.  That said, if you dine in it IS table service.  I opted for the savory scone sandwich with cheddar, ham and eggs.  I had something similar while in Nashville and it was honestly a Top 5 breakfast ever.  That said, I thought my breakfast was tasty and super savory but it seemed a bit steep of price for what it was in actuality.  The vibe here is kind of weird.  I would go into further detail but don't want to sound crass.  I'll be coming back for sure as we were all VERY happy with everything we had. ", pos 
The Steeping Room , 3/1/2016 Great food! I haven't had a meal I did not enjoy here. It's very clean and great for people with dietary restrictions. , pos 
The Steeping Room ," 2/19/2015 I actually step into this restaurant by chance and now is one of my favorites in Austin. I ordered Budha Bowl Java Bowl, Hummus and a couple of teas. I really liked Budha Bowl, the black rice specially, and the best of all that it was super gentle with my stomach and digestion, I felt happy. The Java Bowl was also ok, although the chicken it had was cold and I'm not a fan of cold chicken. This plate came with a sauce that was actually good. I think the best one I tried on the different restaurants I visited while in Austin. This restaurant specializes on teas. And they have really good ones. I ordered Moroccan and Raspberry Iced. Loved both. ", pos 
The Steeping Room ," 1/21/2016 Ok, The Steeping Room IS awesome. How do they have so many great menu items. Of course they have LOTS of teas, but they have numerous gluten free AND vegan choices. Thank you, Thank You, THANK YOU. Ok if there is one complaint, it is that there is no steeping room in south Austin, east Austin or Westlake. Love you guys. ", pos 
The Steeping Room ," 4/30/2015 Loved coming here for tea, and the atmosphere was pretty and fresh. I ordered the strawberry herbal tea, and my friend had the scone and eggs. ", pos 
The Steeping Room , 8/2/2015 The food is just average. The booths didn't feel very clean. The waitstaff was friendly and fairly efficient though.  I went with a tea enthusiast family member and they seemed impressed with the teas and things here. I probably wouldn't go back or recommend this place. , neutral 
The Steeping Room , 5/23/2015 I finally stopped in for lunch with my colleague and I'm so glad we did. I had a delicious coconut milk soup and a chai tea. Yum! , pos
